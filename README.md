# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Reeve's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>WHEN folk had laughed all at this nice case<br/>Of Absolon and Hendy Nicholas,<br/>Diverse folk diversely they said,<br/>But for the more part they laugh'd and play'd;<br/>And at this tale I saw no man him grieve,<br/>But it were only Osewold the Reeve.<br/>Because he was of carpenteres craft,<br/>A little ire is in his hearte laft;<br/>He gan to grudge and blamed it a lite.<br/>"So the I," quoth he, "full well could I him quite<br/>With blearing of a proude miller's eye,<br/>If that me list to speak of ribaldry.<br/>But I am old; me list not play for age;<br/>Grass time is done, my fodder is now forage.<br/>This white top writeth mine olde years;<br/>Mine heart is also moulded as mine hairs;<br/>And I do fare as doth an open-erse;<br/>That ilke fruit is ever longer werse,<br/>Till it be rotten in mullok or in stre.<br/>We olde men, I dread, so fare we;<br/>Till we be rotten, can we not be ripe;<br/>We hop away, while that the world will pipe;<br/>For in our will there sticketh aye a nail,<br/>To have an hoary head and a green tail,<br/>As hath a leek; for though our might be gone,<br/>Our will desireth folly ever-in-one:<br/>For when we may not do, then will we speak,<br/>Yet in our ashes cold does fire reek.<br/>Four gledes have we, which I shall devise,<br/>Vaunting, and lying, anger, covetise.<br/>These foure sparks belongen unto eld.<br/>Our olde limbes well may be unweld,<br/>But will shall never fail us, that is sooth.<br/>And yet have I alway a coltes tooth,<br/>As many a year as it is passed and gone<br/>Since that my tap of life began to run;<br/>For sickerly, when I was born, anon<br/>Death drew the tap of life, and let it gon:<br/>And ever since hath so the tap y-run,<br/>Till that almost all empty is the tun.<br/>The stream of life now droppeth on the chimb.<br/>The silly tongue well may ring and chime<br/>Of wretchedness, that passed is full yore:<br/>With olde folk, save dotage, is no more.<br/><br/>When that our Host had heard this sermoning,<br/>He gan to speak as lordly as a king,<br/>And said; "To what amounteth all this wit?<br/>What? shall we speak all day of holy writ?<br/>The devil made a Reeve for to preach,<br/>As of a souter a shipman, or a leach.<br/>Say forth thy tale, and tarry not the time:<br/>Lo here is Deptford, and 'tis half past prime:<br/>Lo Greenwich, where many a shrew is in.<br/>It were high time thy tale to begin."<br/><br/>"Now, sirs," quoth then this Osewold the Reeve,<br/>I pray you all that none of you do grieve,<br/>Though I answer, and somewhat set his hove,<br/>For lawful is force off with force to shove.<br/>This drunken miller hath y-told us here<br/>How that beguiled was a carpentere,<br/>Paraventure in scorn, for I am one:<br/>And, by your leave, I shall him quite anon.<br/>Right in his churlish termes will I speak,<br/>I pray to God his necke might to-break.<br/>He can well in mine eye see a stalk,<br/>But in his own he cannot see a balk."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>At Trompington, not far from Cantebrig,<br/>There goes a brook, and over that a brig,<br/>Upon the whiche brook there stands a mill:<br/>And this is very sooth that I you tell.<br/>A miller was there dwelling many a day,<br/>As any peacock he was proud and gay:<br/>Pipen he could, and fish, and nettes bete,<br/>And turne cups, and wrestle well, and shete.<br/>Aye by his belt he bare a long pavade,<br/>And of his sword full trenchant was the blade.<br/>A jolly popper bare he in his pouch;<br/>There was no man for peril durst him touch.<br/>A Sheffield whittle bare he in his hose.<br/>Round was his face, and camuse was his nose.<br/>As pilled as an ape's was his skull.<br/>He was a market-beter at the full.<br/>There durste no wight hand upon him legge,<br/>That he ne swore anon he should abegge.<br/><br/>A thief he was, for sooth, of corn and meal,<br/>And that a sly, and used well to steal.<br/>His name was hoten deinous Simekin<br/>A wife he hadde, come of noble kin:<br/>The parson of the town her father was.<br/>With her he gave full many a pan of brass,<br/>For that Simkin should in his blood ally.<br/>She was y-foster'd in a nunnery:<br/>For Simkin woulde no wife, as he said,<br/>But she were well y-nourish'd, and a maid,<br/>To saven his estate and yeomanry:<br/>And she was proud, and pert as is a pie.<br/>A full fair sight it was to see them two;<br/>On holy days before her would he go<br/>With his tippet y-bound about his head;<br/>And she came after in a gite of red,<br/>And Simkin hadde hosen of the same.<br/>There durste no wight call her aught but Dame:<br/>None was so hardy, walking by that way,<br/>That with her either durste rage or play,<br/>But if he would be slain by Simekin<br/>With pavade, or with knife, or bodekin.<br/>For jealous folk be per'lous evermo':<br/>Algate they would their wives wende so.<br/>And eke for she was somewhat smutterlich,<br/>She was as dign as water in a ditch,<br/>And all so full of hoker, and bismare.<br/>Her thoughte that a lady should her spare,<br/>What for her kindred, and her nortelrie<br/>That she had learned in the nunnery.<br/><br/>One daughter hadde they betwixt them two<br/>Of twenty year, withouten any mo,<br/>Saving a child that was of half year age,<br/>In cradle it lay, and was a proper page.<br/>This wenche thick and well y-growen was,<br/>With camuse nose, and eyen gray as glass;<br/>With buttocks broad, and breastes round and high;<br/>But right fair was her hair, I will not lie.<br/>The parson of the town, for she was fair,<br/>In purpose was to make of her his heir<br/>Both of his chattels and his messuage,<br/>And strange he made it of her marriage.<br/>His purpose was for to bestow her high<br/>Into some worthy blood of ancestry.<br/>For holy Church's good may be dispended<br/>On holy Church's blood that is descended.<br/>Therefore he would his holy blood honour<br/>Though that he holy Churche should devour.<br/><br/>Great soken hath this miller, out of doubt,<br/>With wheat and malt, of all the land about;<br/>And namely there was a great college<br/>Men call the Soler Hall at Cantebrege,<br/>There was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.<br/>And on a day it happed in a stound,<br/>Sick lay the manciple of a malady,<br/>Men weened wisly that he shoulde die.<br/>For which this miller stole both meal and corn<br/>An hundred times more than beforn.<br/>For theretofore he stole but courteously,<br/>But now he was a thief outrageously.<br/>For which the warden chid and made fare,<br/>But thereof set the miller not a tare;<br/>He crack'd his boast, and swore it was not so.<br/><br/>Then were there younge poore scholars two,<br/>That dwelled in the hall of which I say;<br/>Testif they were, and lusty for to play;<br/>And only for their mirth and revelry<br/>Upon the warden busily they cry,<br/>To give them leave for but a little stound,<br/>To go to mill, and see their corn y-ground:<br/>And hardily they durste lay their neck,<br/>The miller should not steal them half a peck<br/>Of corn by sleight, nor them by force bereave<br/>And at the last the warden give them leave:<br/>John hight the one, and Alein hight the other,<br/>Of one town were they born, that highte Strother,<br/>Far in the North, I cannot tell you where.<br/>This Alein he made ready all his gear,<br/>And on a horse the sack he cast anon:<br/>Forth went Alein the clerk, and also John,<br/>With good sword and with buckler by their side.<br/>John knew the way, him needed not no guide,<br/>And at the mill the sack adown he lay'th.<br/><br/>Alein spake first; "All hail, Simon, in faith,<br/>How fares thy faire daughter, and thy wife."<br/>"Alein, welcome," quoth Simkin, "by my life,<br/>And John also: how now, what do ye here?"<br/>"By God, Simon," quoth John, "need has no peer.<br/>Him serve himself behoves that has no swain,<br/>Or else he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.<br/>Our manciple I hope he will be dead,<br/>So workes aye the wanges in his head:<br/>And therefore is I come, and eke Alein,<br/>To grind our corn and carry it home again:<br/>I pray you speed us hence as well ye may."<br/>"It shall be done," quoth Simkin, "by my fay.<br/>What will ye do while that it is in hand?"<br/>"By God, right by the hopper will I stand,"<br/>Quoth John, "and see how that the corn goes in.<br/>Yet saw I never, by my father's kin,<br/>How that the hopper wagges to and fro."<br/>Alein answered, "John, and wilt thou so?<br/>Then will I be beneathe, by my crown,<br/>And see how that the meale falls adown<br/>Into the trough, that shall be my disport:<br/>For, John, in faith I may be of your sort;<br/>I is as ill a miller as is ye."<br/><br/>This miller smiled at their nicety,<br/>And thought, "All this is done but for a wile.<br/>They weenen that no man may them beguile,<br/>But by my thrift yet shall I blear their eye,<br/>For all the sleight in their philosophy.<br/>The more quainte knackes that they make,<br/>The more will I steal when that I take.<br/>Instead of flour yet will I give them bren.<br/>The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,<br/>As whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare:<br/>Of all their art ne count I not a tare."<br/>Out at the door he went full privily,<br/>When that he saw his time, softely.<br/>He looked up and down, until he found<br/>The clerkes' horse, there as he stood y-bound<br/>Behind the mill, under a levesell:<br/>And to the horse he went him fair and well,<br/>And stripped off the bridle right anon.<br/>And when the horse was loose, he gan to gon<br/>Toward the fen, where wilde mares run,<br/>Forth, with "Wehee!" through thick and eke through thin.<br/>This miller went again, no word he said,<br/>But did his note, and with these clerkes play'd,<br/>Till that their corn was fair and well y-ground.<br/>And when the meal was sacked and y-bound,<br/>Then John went out, and found his horse away,<br/>And gan to cry, "Harow, and well-away!<br/>Our horse is lost: Alein, for Godde's bones,<br/>Step on thy feet; come off, man, all at once:<br/>Alas! our warden has his palfrey lorn."<br/>This Alein all forgot, both meal and corn;<br/>All was out of his mind his husbandry.<br/>"What, which way is he gone?" he gan to cry.<br/>The wife came leaping inward at a renne,<br/>She said; "Alas! your horse went to the fen<br/>With wilde mares, as fast as he could go.<br/>Unthank come on his hand that bound him so<br/>And his that better should have knit the rein."<br/>"Alas!" quoth John, "Alein, for Christes pain<br/>Lay down thy sword, and I shall mine also.<br/>I is full wight, God wate, as is a roe.<br/>By Godde's soul he shall not scape us bathe.<br/>Why n' had thou put the capel in the lathe?<br/>Ill hail, Alein, by God thou is a fonne."<br/>These silly clerkes have full fast y-run<br/>Toward the fen, both Alein and eke John;<br/>And when the miller saw that they were gone,<br/>He half a bushel of their flour did take,<br/>And bade his wife go knead it in a cake.<br/>He said; I trow, the clerkes were afeard,<br/>Yet can a miller make a clerkes beard,<br/>For all his art: yea, let them go their way!<br/>Lo where they go! yea, let the children play:<br/>They get him not so lightly, by my crown."<br/>These silly clerkes runnen up and down<br/>With "Keep, keep; stand, stand; jossa, warderere.<br/>Go whistle thou, and I shall keep him here."<br/>But shortly, till that it was very night<br/>They coulde not, though they did all their might,<br/>Their capel catch, he ran alway so fast:<br/>Till in a ditch they caught him at the last.<br/><br/>Weary and wet, as beastes in the rain,<br/>Comes silly John, and with him comes Alein.<br/>"Alas," quoth John, "the day that I was born!<br/>Now are we driv'n till hething and till scorn.<br/>Our corn is stol'n, men will us fonnes call,<br/>Both the warden, and eke our fellows all,<br/>And namely the miller, well-away!"<br/>Thus plained John, as he went by the way<br/>Toward the mill, and Bayard in his hand.<br/>The miller sitting by the fire he fand.<br/>For it was night, and forther might they not,<br/>But for the love of God they him besought<br/>Of herberow and ease, for their penny.<br/>The miller said again," If there be any,<br/>Such as it is, yet shall ye have your part.<br/>Mine house is strait, but ye have learned art;<br/>Ye can by arguments maken a place<br/>A mile broad, of twenty foot of space.<br/>Let see now if this place may suffice,<br/>Or make it room with speech, as is your guise."<br/>"Now, Simon," said this John, "by Saint Cuthberd<br/>Aye is thou merry, and that is fair answer'd.<br/>I have heard say, man shall take of two things,<br/>Such as he findes, or such as he brings.<br/>But specially I pray thee, hoste dear,<br/>Gar  us have meat and drink, and make us cheer,<br/>And we shall pay thee truly at the full:<br/>With empty hand men may not hawkes tull.<br/>Lo here our silver ready for to spend."<br/><br/>This miller to the town his daughter send<br/>For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,<br/>And bound their horse, he should no more go loose:<br/>And them in his own chamber made a bed.<br/>With sheetes and with chalons fair y-spread,<br/>Not from his owen bed ten foot or twelve:<br/>His daughter had a bed all by herselve,<br/>Right in the same chamber by and by:<br/>It might no better be, and cause why,<br/>There was no roomer herberow in the place.<br/>They suppen, and they speaken of solace,<br/>And drinken ever strong ale at the best.<br/>Aboute midnight went they all to rest.<br/>Well had this miller varnished his head;<br/>Full pale he was, fordrunken, and nought red.<br/>He yoxed, and he spake thorough the nose,<br/>As he were in the quakke, or in the pose.<br/>To bed he went, and with him went his wife,<br/>As any jay she light was and jolife,<br/>So was her jolly whistle well y-wet.<br/>The cradle at her beddes feet was set,<br/>To rock, and eke to give the child to suck.<br/>And when that drunken was all in the crock<br/>To bedde went the daughter right anon,<br/>To bedde went Alein, and also John.<br/>There was no more; needed them no dwale.<br/>This miller had, so wisly bibbed ale,<br/>That as a horse he snorted in his sleep,<br/>Nor of his tail behind he took no keep.<br/>His wife bare him a burdoun, a full strong;<br/>Men might their routing hearen a furlong.<br/><br/>The wenche routed eke for company.<br/>Alein the clerk, that heard this melody,<br/>He poked John, and saide: "Sleepest thou?<br/>Heardest thou ever such a song ere now?<br/>Lo what a compline is y-mell them all.<br/>A wilde fire upon their bodies fall,<br/>Who hearken'd ever such a ferly thing?<br/>Yea, they shall have the flow'r of ill ending!<br/>This longe night there tides me no rest.<br/>But yet no force, all shall be for the best.<br/>For, John," said he, "as ever may I thrive,<br/>If that I may, yon wenche will I swive.<br/>Some easement has law y-shapen us<br/>For, John, there is a law that sayeth thus,<br/>That if a man in one point be aggriev'd,<br/>That in another he shall be relievd.<br/>Our corn is stol'n, soothly it is no nay,<br/>And we have had an evil fit to-day.<br/>And since I shall have none amendement<br/>Against my loss, I will have easement:<br/>By Godde's soul, it shall none, other be."<br/>This John answer'd; Alein, avise thee:<br/>The miller is a perilous man," he said,<br/>"And if that he out of his sleep abraid,<br/>He mighte do us both a villainy."<br/>Alein answer'd; "I count him not a fly.<br/>And up he rose, and by the wench he crept.<br/>This wenche lay upright, and fast she slept,<br/>Till he so nigh was, ere she might espy,<br/>That it had been too late for to cry:<br/>And, shortly for to say, they were at one.<br/>Now play, Alein, for I will speak of John.<br/><br/>This John lay still a furlong way  or two,<br/>And to himself he made ruth and woe.<br/>"Alas!" quoth he, "this is a wicked jape;<br/>Now may I say, that I is but an ape.<br/>Yet has my fellow somewhat for his harm;<br/>He has the miller's daughter in his arm:<br/>He auntred him, and hath his needes sped,<br/>And I lie as a draff-sack in my bed;<br/>And when this jape is told another day,<br/>I shall be held a daffe or a cockenay<br/>I will arise, and auntre it, by my fay:<br/>Unhardy is unsely,  as men say."<br/>And up he rose, and softely he went<br/>Unto the cradle, and in his hand it hent,<br/>And bare it soft unto his beddes feet.<br/>Soon after this the wife her routing lete,<br/>And gan awake, and went her out to piss<br/>And came again and gan the cradle miss<br/>And groped here and there, but she found none.<br/>"Alas!" quoth she, "I had almost misgone<br/>I had almost gone to the clerkes' bed.<br/>Ey! Benedicite, then had I foul y-sped."<br/>And forth she went, till she the cradle fand.<br/>She groped alway farther with her hand<br/>And found the bed, and thoughte not but good<br/>Because that the cradle by it stood,<br/>And wist not where she was, for it was derk;<br/>But fair and well she crept in by the clerk,<br/>And lay full still, and would have caught a sleep.<br/>Within a while this John the Clerk up leap<br/>And on this goode wife laid on full sore;<br/>So merry a fit had she not had full yore.<br/>He pricked hard and deep, as he were mad.<br/><br/>This jolly life have these two clerkes had,<br/>Till that the thirde cock began to sing.<br/>Alein wax'd weary in the morrowing,<br/>For he had swonken all the longe night,<br/>And saide; "Farewell, Malkin, my sweet wight.<br/>The day is come, I may no longer bide,<br/>But evermore, where so I go or ride,<br/>I is thine owen clerk, so have I hele."<br/>"Now, deare leman," quoth she, "go, fare wele:<br/>But ere thou go, one thing I will thee tell.<br/>When that thou wendest homeward by the mill,<br/>Right at the entry of the door behind<br/>Thou shalt a cake of half a bushel find,<br/>That was y-maked of thine owen meal,<br/>Which that I help'd my father for to steal.<br/>And goode leman, God thee save and keep."<br/>And with that word she gan almost to weep.<br/>Alein uprose and thought, "Ere the day daw<br/>I will go creepen in by my fellaw:"<br/>And found the cradle with his hand anon.<br/>"By God!" thought he, "all wrong I have misgone:<br/>My head is totty of my swink to-night,<br/>That maketh me that I go not aright.<br/>I wot well by the cradle I have misgo';<br/>Here lie the miller and his wife also."<br/>And forth he went a twenty devil way<br/>Unto the bed, there as the miller lay.<br/>He ween'd t' have creeped by his fellow John,<br/>And by the miller in he crept anon,<br/>And caught him by the neck, and gan him shake,<br/>And said; "Thou John, thou swines-head, awake<br/>For Christes soul, and hear a noble game!<br/>For by that lord that called is Saint Jame,<br/>As I have thries in this shorte night<br/>Swived the miller's daughter bolt-upright,<br/>While thou hast as a coward lain aghast."<br/>"Thou false harlot," quoth the miller, "hast?<br/>Ah, false traitor, false clerk," quoth he,<br/>"Thou shalt be dead, by Godde's dignity,<br/>Who durste be so bold to disparage<br/>My daughter, that is come of such lineage?"<br/>And by the throate-ball he caught Alein,<br/>And he him hent dispiteously again,<br/>And on the nose he smote him with his fist;<br/>Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast:<br/>And in the floor with nose and mouth all broke<br/>They wallow, as do two pigs in a poke.<br/>And up they go, and down again anon,<br/>Till that the miller spurned on a stone,<br/>And down he backward fell upon his wife,<br/>That wiste nothing of this nice strife:<br/>For she was fall'n asleep a little wight<br/>With John the clerk, that waked had all night:<br/>And with the fall out of her sleep she braid.<br/>"Help, holy cross of Bromeholm,"  she said;<br/>"In manus tuas!  Lord, to thee I call.<br/>Awake, Simon, the fiend is on me fall;<br/>Mine heart is broken; help; I am but dead:<br/>There li'th one on my womb and on mine head.<br/>Help, Simkin, for these false clerks do fight"<br/>This John start up as fast as e'er he might,<br/>And groped by the walles to and fro<br/>To find a staff; and she start up also,<br/>And knew the estres better than this John,<br/>And by the wall she took a staff anon:<br/>And saw a little shimmering of a light,<br/>For at an hole in shone the moone bright,<br/>And by that light she saw them both the two,<br/>But sickerly she wist not who was who,<br/>But as she saw a white thing in her eye.<br/>And when she gan this white thing espy,<br/>She ween'd the clerk had wear'd a volupere;<br/>And with the staff she drew aye nere and nere,<br/>And ween'd to have hit this Alein at the full,<br/>And smote the miller on the pilled skull;<br/>That down he went, and cried," Harow! I die."<br/>These clerkes beat him well, and let him lie,<br/>And greithen them, and take their horse anon,<br/>And eke their meal, and on their way they gon:<br/>And at the mill door eke they took their cake<br/>Of half a bushel flour, full well y-bake.<br/><br/>Thus is the proude miller well y-beat,<br/>And hath y-lost the grinding of the wheat;<br/>And payed for the supper every deal<br/>Of Alein and of John, that beat him well;<br/>His wife is swived, and his daughter als;<br/>Lo, such it is a miller to be false.<br/>And therefore this proverb is said full sooth,<br/>"Him thar not winnen well that evil do'th,<br/>A guiler shall himself beguiled be:"<br/>And God that sitteth high in majesty<br/>Save all this Company, both great and smale.<br/>Thus have I quit the Miller in my tale.
