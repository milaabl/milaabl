# üíÆ Obermann Once More by *Matthew Arnold*

<p>
    Glion?--Ah, twenty years, it cuts<br/>All meaning from a name!<br/>White houses prank where once were huts.<br/>Glion, but not the same!<br/><br/>And yet I know not! All unchanged<br/>The turf, the pines, the sky!<br/>The hills in their old order ranged;<br/>The lake, with Chillon by!<br/><br/>And, 'neath those chestnut-trees, where stiff<br/>And stony mounts the way,<br/>The crackling husk-heaps burn, as if<br/>I left them yesterday!<br/><br/>Across the valley, on that slope,<br/>The huts of Avant shine!<br/>lts pines, under their branches, ope<br/>Ways for the pasturing kine.<br/><br/>Full-foaming milk-pails, Alpine fare,<br/>Sweet heaps of fresh-cut grass,<br/>Invite to rest the traveller there<br/>Before he climb the pass--<br/><br/>The gentian-flower'd pass, its crown<br/>With yellow spires aflame;<br/>Whence drops the path to Alli–∏re down,<br/>And walls where Byron came,<br/><br/>By their green river, who doth change<br/>His birth-name just below;<br/>Orchard, and croft, and full-stored grange<br/>Nursed by his pastoral flow.<br/><br/>But stop!--to fetch back thoughts that stray<br/>Beyond this gracious bound,<br/>The cone of Jaman, pale and gray,<br/>See, in the blue profound!<br/><br/>Ah, Jaman! delicately tall<br/>Above his sun-warm'd firs--<br/>What thoughts to me his rocks recall,<br/>What memories he stirs!<br/><br/>And who but thou must be, in truth,<br/>Obermann! with me here?<br/>Thou master of my wandering youth,<br/>But left this many a year!<br/><br/>Yes, I forget the world's work wrought,<br/>Its warfare waged with pain;<br/>An eremite with thee, in thought<br/>Once more I slip my chain,<br/><br/>And to thy mountain-chalet come,<br/>And lie beside its door,<br/>And hear the wild bee's Alpine hum,<br/>And thy sad, tranquil lore!<br/><br/>Again I feel the words inspire<br/>Their mournful calm; serene,<br/>Yet tinged with infinite desire<br/>For all that might have been--<br/><br/>The harmony from which man swerved<br/>Made his life's rule once more!<br/>The universal order served,<br/>Earth happier than before!<br/><br/>--While thus I mused, night gently ran<br/>Down over hill and wood.<br/>Then, still and sudden, Obermann<br/>On the grass near me stood.<br/><br/>Those pensive features well I knew,<br/>On my mind, years before,<br/>Imaged so oft! imaged so true!<br/>--A shepherd's garb he wore,<br/><br/>A mountain-flower was in his hand,<br/>A book was in his breast.<br/>Bent on my face, with gaze which scann'd<br/>My soul, his eyes did rest.<br/><br/>'And is it thou,' he cried, 'so long<br/>Held by the world which we<br/>Loved not, who turnest from the throng<br/>Back to thy youth and me?<br/><br/>'And from thy world, with heart opprest,<br/>Choosest thou now to turn?--<br/>Ah me! we anchorites read things best,<br/>Clearest their course discern!<br/><br/>'Thou fledst me when the ungenial earth,<br/>Man's work-place, lay in gloom.<br/>Return'st thou in her hour of birth,<br/>Of hopes and hearts in bloom?<br/><br/>'Perceiv'st thou not the change of day?<br/>Ah! Carry back thy ken,<br/>What, some two thousand years! Survey<br/>The world as it was then!<br/><br/>'Like ours it look'd in outward air.<br/>Its head was clear and true,<br/>Sumptuous its clothing, rich its fare,<br/>No pause its action knew;<br/><br/>'Stout was its arm, each thew and bone<br/>Seem'd puissant and alive--<br/>But, ah! its heart, its heart was stone,<br/>And so it could not thrive!<br/><br/>'On that hard Pagan world disgust<br/>And secret loathing fell.<br/>Deep weariness and sated lust<br/>Made human life a hell.<br/><br/>'In his cool hall, with haggard eyes,<br/>The Roman noble lay;<br/>He drove abroad, in furious guise,<br/>Along the Appian way.<br/><br/>'He made a feast, drank fierce and fast,<br/>And crown'd his hair with flowers--<br/>No easier nor no quicker pass'd<br/>The impracticable hours.<br/><br/>'The brooding East with awe beheld<br/>Her impious younger world.<br/>The Roman tempest swell'd and swell'd,<br/>And on her head was hurl'd.<br/><br/>'The East bow'd low before the blast<br/>In patient, deep disdain;<br/>She let the legions thunder past,<br/>And plunged in thought again.<br/><br/>'So well she mused, a morning broke<br/>Across her spirit grey;<br/>A conquering, new-born joy awoke,<br/>And fill'd her life with day.<br/><br/>''Poor world,' she cried, 'so deep accurst,<br/>That runn'st from pole to pole<br/>To seek a draught to slake thy thirst--<br/>Go, seek it in thy soul!'<br/><br/>'She heard it, the victorious West,<br/>In crown and sword array'd!<br/>She felt the void which mined her breast,<br/>She shiver'd and obey'd.<br/><br/>'She veil'd her eagles, snapp'd her sword,<br/>And laid her sceptre down;<br/>Her stately purple she abhorr'd,<br/>And her imperial crown.<br/><br/>'She broke her flutes, she stopp'd her sports,<br/>Her artists could not please;<br/>She tore her books, she shut her courts,<br/>She fled her palaces;<br/><br/>'Lust of the eye and pride of life<br/>She left it all behind,<br/>And hurried, torn with inward strife,<br/>The wilderness to find.<br/><br/>'Tears wash'd the trouble from her face!<br/>She changed into a child!<br/>'Mid weeds and wrecks she stood--a place<br/>Of ruin--but she smiled!<br/><br/>'Oh, had I lived in that great day,<br/>How had its glory new<br/>Fill'd earth and heaven, and caught away<br/>My ravish'd spirit too!<br/><br/>'No thoughts that to the world belong<br/>Had stood against the wave<br/>Of love which set so deep and strong<br/>From Christ's then open grave.<br/><br/>'No cloister-floor of humid stone<br/>Had been too cold for me.<br/>For me no Eastern desert lone<br/>Had been too far to flee.<br/><br/>'No lonely life had pass'd too slow,<br/>When I could hourly scan<br/>Upon his Cross, with head sunk low,<br/>That nail'd, thorn-crowned Man!<br/><br/>'Could see the Mother with her Child<br/>Whose tender winning arts<br/>Have to his little arms beguiled<br/>So many wounded hearts!<br/><br/>'And centuries came and ran their course,<br/>And unspent all that time<br/>Still, still went forth that Child's dear force,<br/>And still was at its prime.<br/><br/>'Ay, ages long endured his span<br/>Of life--'tis true received--<br/>That gracious Child, that thorn-crown'd Man!<br/>--He lived while we believed.<br/><br/>'While we believed, on earth he went,<br/>And open stood his grave.<br/>Men call'd from chamber, church, and tent;<br/>And Christ was by to save.<br/><br/>'Now he is dead! Far hence he lies<br/>In the lorn Syrian town;<br/>And on his grave, with shining eyes,<br/>The Syrian stars look down.<br/><br/>'In vain men still, with hoping new,<br/>Regard his death-place dumb,<br/>And say the stone is not yet to,<br/>And wait for words to come.<br/><br/>'Ah, o'er that silent sacred land,<br/>Of sun, and arid stone,<br/>And crumbling wall, and sultry sand,<br/>Sounds now one word alone!<br/><br/>'Unduped of fancy, henceforth man<br/>Must labour!--must resign<br/>His all too human creeds, and scan<br/>Simply the way divine!<br/><br/>'But slow that tide of common thought,<br/>Which bathed our life, retired;<br/>Slow, slow the old world wore to nought,<br/>And pulse by pulse expired.<br/><br/>'Its frame yet stood without a breach<br/>When blood and warmth were fled;<br/>And still it spake its wonted speech--<br/>But every word was dead.<br/><br/>'And oh, we cried, that on this corse<br/>Might fall a freshening storm!<br/>Rive its dry bones, and with new force<br/>A new-sprung world inform!<br/><br/>'--Down came the storm! O'er France it pass'd<br/>In sheets of scathing fire;<br/>All Europe felt that fiery blast,<br/>And shook as it rush'd by her.<br/><br/>'Down came the storm! In ruins fell<br/>The worn-out world we knew.<br/>It pass'd, that elemental swell!<br/>Again appear'd the blue;<br/><br/>'The sun shone in the new-wash'd sky,<br/>And what from heaven saw he?<br/>Blocks of the past, like icebergs high,<br/>Float on a rolling sea!<br/><br/>'Upon them plies the race of man<br/>All it before endeavour'd;<br/>'Ye live,' I cried, 'ye work and plan,<br/>And know not ye are sever'd!<br/><br/>''Poor fragments of a broken world<br/>Whereon men pitch their tent!<br/>Why were ye too to death not hurl'd<br/>When your world's day was spent?<br/><br/>''That glow of central fire is done<br/>Which with its fusing flame<br/>Knit all your parts, and kept you one--<br/>But ye, ye are the same!<br/><br/>''The past, its mask of union on,<br/>Had ceased to live and thrive.<br/>The past, its mask of union gone,<br/>Say, is it more alive?<br/><br/>''Your creeds are dead, your rites are dead,<br/>Your social order too!<br/>Where tarries he, the Power who said:<br/>See, I make all things new?<br/><br/>''The millions suffer still, and grieve,<br/>And what can helpers heal<br/>With old-world cures men half believe<br/>For woes they wholly feel?<br/><br/>''And yet men have such need of joy!<br/>But joy whose grounds are true;<br/>And joy that should all hearts employ<br/>As when the past was new.<br/><br/>''Ah, not the emotion of that past,<br/>Its common hope, were vain!<br/>Some new such hope must dawn at last,<br/>Or man must toss in pain.<br/><br/>''But now the old is out of date,<br/>The new is not yet born,<br/>And who can be alone elate,<br/>While the world lies forlorn?'<br/><br/>'Then to the wilderness I fled.--<br/>There among Alpine snows<br/>And pastoral huts I hid my head,<br/>And sought and found repose.<br/><br/>'It was not yet the appointed hour.<br/>Sad, patient, and resign'd,<br/>I watch'd the crocus fade and flower,<br/>I felt the sun and wind.<br/><br/>'The day I lived in was not mine,<br/>Man gets no second day.<br/>In dreams I saw the future shine--<br/>But ah! I could not stay!<br/><br/>'Action I had not, followers, fame;<br/>I pass'd obscure, alone.<br/>The after-world forgets my name,<br/>Nor do I wish it known.<br/><br/>'Composed to bear, I lived and died,<br/>And knew my life was vain.<br/>With fate I murmur not, nor chide;<br/>At S–∏vres by the Seine<br/><br/>'(If Paris that brief flight allow)<br/>My humble tomb explore!<br/>It bears: Eternity, be thou<br/>My refuge! and no more.<br/><br/>'But thou, whom fellowship of mood<br/>Did make from haunts of strife<br/>Come to my mountain-solitude,<br/>And learn my frustrate life;<br/><br/>'O thou, who, ere thy flying span<br/>Was past of cheerful youth,<br/>Didst find the solitary man<br/>And love his cheerless truth--<br/><br/>'Despair not thou as I despair'd,<br/>Nor be cold gloom thy prison!<br/>Forward the gracious hours have fared,<br/>And see! the sun is risen!<br/><br/>'He breaks the winter of the past;<br/>A green, new earth appears.<br/>Millions, whose life in ice lay fast,<br/>Have thoughts, and smiles, and tears.<br/><br/>'What though there still need effort, strife?<br/>Though much be still unwon?<br/>Yet warm it mounts, the hour of life!<br/>Death's frozen hour is done!<br/><br/>'The world's great order dawns in sheen,<br/>After long darkness rude,<br/>Divinelier imaged, clearer seen,<br/>With happier zeal pursued.<br/><br/>'With hope extinct and brow composed<br/>I mark'd the present die;<br/>Its term of life was nearly closed,<br/>Yet it had more than I.<br/><br/>'But thou, though to the world's new hour<br/>Thou come with aspect marr'd,<br/>Shorn of the joy, the bloom, the power,<br/>Which best befits its bard--<br/><br/>'Though more than half thy years be past,<br/>And spent thy youthful prime;<br/>Though, round thy firmer manhood cast,<br/>Hang weeds of our sad time<br/><br/>'Whereof thy youth felt all the spell,<br/>And traversed all the shade--<br/>Though late, though dimm'd, though weak, yet tell<br/>Hope to a world new-made!<br/><br/>'Help it to fill that deep desire,<br/>The want which rack'd our brain,<br/>Consumed our heart with thirst like fire,<br/>Immedicable pain;<br/><br/>'Which to the wilderness drove out<br/>Our life, to Alpine snow,<br/>And palsied all our word with doubt,<br/>And all our work with woe--<br/><br/>'What still of strength is left, employ<br/>That end to help attain:<br/>One common wave of thought and joy<br/>Lifting mankind again!'<br/><br/>--The vision ended. I awoke<br/>As out of sleep, and no<br/>Voice moved;--only the torrent broke<br/>The silence, far below.<br/><br/>Soft darkness on the turf did lie.<br/>Solemn, o'er hut and wood,<br/>In the yet star-sown nightly sky,<br/>The peak of Jaman stood.<br/><br/>Still in my soul the voice I heard<br/>Of Obermann!--away<br/>I turn'd; by some vague impulse stirr'd,<br/>Along the rocks of Naye<br/><br/>Past Sonchaud's piny flanks I gaze<br/>And the blanch'd summit bare<br/>Of Malatrait, to where in haze<br/>The Valais opens fair,<br/><br/>And the domed Velan, with his snows,<br/>Behind the upcrowding hills,<br/>Doth all the heavenly opening close<br/>Which the Rhone's murmur fills--<br/><br/>And glorious there, without a sound,<br/>Across the glimmering lake,<br/>High in the Valais-depth profound,<br/>I saw the morning break.
