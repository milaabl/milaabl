  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Happy the Lab'rer by *Jane Austen*

<p>
    Happy the lab'rer in his Sunday clothes!<br/>In light-drab coat, smart waistcoat, well-darn'd hose,<br/>Andhat upon his head, to church he goes;<br/>As oft, with conscious pride, he downward throws<br/>A glance upon the ample cabbage rose<br/>That, stuck in button-hole, regales his nose,<br/>He envies not the gayest London beaux.<br/>In church he takes his seat among the rows,<br/>Pays to the place the reverence he owes,<br/>Likes best the prayers whose meaning least he knows,<br/>Lists to the sermon in a softening doze,<br/>And rouses joyous at the welcome close.
</p>
