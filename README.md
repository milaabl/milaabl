  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ France, the 18th year of These States. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    1<br/>A GREAT year and place;<br/>A harsh, discordant, natal scream out-sounding, to touch the mother‚Äôs heart closer<br/>    than<br/>  any yet.<br/><br/>I walk‚Äôd the shores of my Eastern Sea,<br/>Heard over the waves the little voice,<br/>Saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the roar of cannon,<br/>    curses,<br/>  shouts, crash of falling buildings;<br/>Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running‚Äînor from the single corpses,<br/>    nor<br/>  those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils;<br/>Was not so desperate at the battues of death‚Äîwas not so shock‚Äôd at the repeated<br/>  fusillades of the guns.<br/><br/>2<br/>Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued retribution?<br/>Could I wish humanity different?<br/>Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?<br/>Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?<br/><br/>3<br/>O Liberty! O mate for me!<br/>Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve, to fetch them out in case of<br/>    need;<br/>Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy‚Äôd;<br/>Here too could rise at last, murdering and extatic;<br/>Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.<br/><br/>4<br/>Hence I sign this salute over the sea,<br/>And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,<br/>But remember the little voice that I heard wailing‚Äîand wait with perfect trust, no<br/>    matter<br/>  how long;<br/>And from to-day, sad and cogent, I maintain the bequeath‚Äôd cause, as for all lands,<br/>And I send these words to Paris with my love,<br/>And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,<br/>For I guess there is latent music yet in France‚Äîfloods of it;<br/>O I hear already the bustle of instruments‚Äîthey will soon be drowning all that would<br/>  interrupt them;<br/>O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,<br/>It reaches hither‚Äîit swells me to joyful madness,<br/>I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,<br/>I will yet sing a song for you, MA FEMME.
</p>
