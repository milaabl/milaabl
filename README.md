  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Churchill's Grave, a Fact Literally Rendered by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    I stood beside the grave of him who blazed<br/>The Comet of a season, and I saw<br/>The humblest of all sepulchres, and gazed<br/>  With not the less of sorrow and of awe<br/>On that neglected turf and quiet stone,<br/>With name no clearer than the names unknown,<br/>Which lay unread around it; and I asked<br/>  The Gardener of that ground, why it might be<br/>That for this plant strangers his memory tasked,<br/>  Through the thick deaths of half a century;<br/>And thus he answered--"Well, I do not know<br/>Why frequent travellers turn to pilgrims so;<br/>He died before my day of Sextonship,<br/>  And I had not the digging of this grave."<br/>And is this all? I thought,--and do we rip<br/>  The veil of Immortality, and crave<br/>I know not what of honour and of light<br/>Through unborn ages, to endure this blight?<br/>So soon, and so successless? As I said,<br/>The Architect of all on which we tread,<br/>For Earth is but a tombstone, did essay<br/>To extricate remembrance from the clay,<br/>Whose minglings might confuse a Newton's thought,<br/>  Were it not that all life must end in one,<br/>Of which we are but dreamers;--as he caught<br/>  As 'twere the twilight of a former Sun,<br/>Thus spoke he,--"I believe the man of whom<br/>You wot, who lies in this selected tomb,<br/>Was a most famous writer in his day,<br/>And therefore travellers step from out their way<br/>To pay him honour,--and myself whate'er<br/>  Your honour pleases:"--then most pleased I shook<br/>  From out my pocket's avaricious nook<br/>Some certain coins of silver, which as 'twere<br/>Perforce I gave this man, though I could spare<br/>So much but inconveniently:--Ye smile,<br/>I see ye, ye profane ones! all the while,<br/>Because my homely phrase the truth would tell.<br/>You are the fools, not I--for I did dwell<br/>With a deep thought, and with a softened eye,<br/>On that old Sexton's natural homily,<br/>In which there was Obscurity and Fame,--<br/>The Glory and the Nothing of a Name.
