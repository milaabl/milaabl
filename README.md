# üíÆ The Deformed Transformed: by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    PART I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A Forest_.<br/><br/>             _Enter_ ARNOLD _and his mother_ BERTHA.<br/><br/>_Bert._ Out, Hunchback!<br/><br/>_Arn._                 I was born so, Mother!<br/><br/>_Bert._                                       Out,<br/>Thou incubus! Thou nightmare! Of seven sons,<br/>The sole abortion!<br/><br/>_Arn._              Would that I had been so,<br/>And never seen the light!<br/><br/>_Bert._                  I would so, too!<br/>But as thou _hast_--hence, hence--and do thy best!<br/>That back of thine may bear its burthen; 'tis<br/>More high, if not so broad as that of others.<br/><br/>_Arn._ It _bears_ its burthen;--but, my heart! Will it<br/>Sustain that which you lay upon it, Mother?<br/>I love, or, at the least, I loved you: nothing<br/>Save You, in nature, can love aught like me.<br/>You nursed me--do not kill me!<br/><br/>_Bert._                      Yes--I nursed thee,<br/>Because thou wert my first-born, and I knew not<br/>If there would be another unlike thee,<br/>That monstrous sport of Nature. But get hence,<br/>And gather wood!<br/><br/>_Arn._           I will: but when I bring it,<br/>Speak to me kindly. Though my brothers are<br/>So beautiful and lusty, and as free<br/>As the free chase they follow, do not spurn me:<br/>Our milk has been the same.<br/><br/>_Bert._                    As is the hedgehog's,<br/>Which sucks at midnight from the wholesome dam<br/>Of the young bull, until the milkmaid finds<br/>The nipple, next day, sore, and udder dry.<br/>Call not thy brothers brethren! Call me not<br/>Mother; for if I brought thee forth, it was<br/>As foolish hens at times hatch vipers, by<br/>Sitting upon strange eggs. Out, urchin, out!<br/>                                                       [_Exit_ BERTHA.<br/><br/>_Arn._ (_solus_). Oh, mother!--She is gone, and I must do<br/>Her bidding;--wearily but willingly<br/>I would fulfil it, could I only hope<br/>A kind word in return. What shall I do?<br/><br/>                            [_ARNOLD begins to cut wood: in doing this<br/>                                 he wounds one of his hands_.<br/><br/>My labour for the day is over now.<br/>Accursed be this blood that flows so fast;<br/>For double curses will be my meed now<br/>At home--What home? I have no home, no kin,<br/>No kind--not made like other creatures, or<br/>To share their sports or pleasures. Must I bleed, too,<br/>Like them? Oh, that each drop which falls to earth<br/>Would rise a snake to sting them, as they have stung me!<br/>Or that the Devil, to whom they liken me,<br/>Would aid his likeness! If I must partake<br/>His form, why not his power? Is it because<br/>I have not his will too? For one kind word<br/>From her who bore me would still reconcile me<br/>Even to this hateful aspect. Let me wash<br/>The wound.<br/><br/>                         [ARNOLD _goes to a spring, and stoops to wash<br/>                                 his hand: he starts back_.<br/><br/>They are right; and Nature's mirror shows me,<br/>What she hath made me. I will not look on it<br/>Again, and scarce dare think on't. Hideous wretch<br/>That I am! The very waters mock me with<br/>My horrid shadow--like a demon placed<br/>Deep in the fountain to scare back the cattle<br/>From drinking therein.                                   [_He pauses_.<br/>                       And shall I live on,<br/>A burden to the earth, myself, and shame<br/>Unto what brought me into life? Thou blood,<br/>Which flowest so freely from a scratch, let me<br/>Try if thou wilt not, in a fuller stream,<br/>Pour forth my woes for ever with thyself<br/>On earth, to which I will restore, at once,<br/>This hateful compound of her atoms, and<br/>Resolve back to her elements, and take<br/>The shape of any reptile save myself,<br/>And make a world for myriads of new worms!<br/>This knife! now let me prove if it will sever<br/>This withered slip of Nature's nightshade--my<br/>Vile form--from the creation, as it hath<br/>The green bough from the forest.<br/><br/>                         [ARNOLD _places the knife in the ground, with<br/>                                the point upwards_.<br/><br/>                                Now 'tis set,<br/>And I can fall upon it. Yet one glance<br/>On the fair day, which sees no foul thing like<br/>Myself, and the sweet sun which warmed me, but<br/>In vain. The birds--how joyously they sing!<br/>So let them, for I would not be lamented:<br/>But let their merriest notes be Arnold's knell;<br/>The fallen leaves my monument; the murmur<br/>Of the near fountain my sole elegy.<br/>Now, knife, stand firmly, as I fain would fall!<br/><br/>                       [_As he rushes to throw himself upon the knife,<br/>                           his eye is suddenly caught by the fountain,<br/>                           which seems in motion_.<br/><br/>The fountain moves without a wind: but shall<br/>The ripple of a spring change my resolve?<br/>No. Yet it moves again! The waters stir,<br/>Not as with air, but by some subterrane<br/>And rocking Power of the internal world.<br/>What's here? A mist! No more?--<br/><br/>                   [_A cloud comes from the fountain. He stands gazing<br/>                         upon it: it is dispelled, and a tall black<br/>                         man comes towards him_.<br/><br/>_Arn._                           What would you? Speak!<br/>Spirit or man?<br/><br/>_Stran._       As man is both, why not<br/>Say both in one?<br/><br/>_Arn._          Your form is man's, and yet<br/>You may be devil.<br/><br/>_Stran._         So many men are that<br/>Which is so called or thought, that you may add me<br/>To which you please, without much wrong to either.<br/>But come: you wish to kill yourself;--pursue<br/>Your purpose.<br/><br/>_Arn._       You have interrupted me.<br/><br/>_Stran._ What is that resolution which can e'er<br/>Be interrupted? If I be the devil<br/>You deem, a single moment would have made you<br/>Mine, and for ever, by your suicide;<br/>And yet my coming saves you.<br/><br/>_Arn._                       I said not<br/>You _were_ the Demon, but that your approach<br/>Was like one.<br/><br/>_Stran._      Unless you keep company<br/>With him (and you seem scarce used to such high<br/>Society) you can't tell how he approaches;<br/>And for his aspect, look upon the fountain,<br/>And then on me, and judge which of us twain<br/>Looks likest what the boors believe to be<br/>Their cloven-footed terror.<br/><br/>_Arn._                      Do you--dare _you_<br/>To taunt me with my born deformity?<br/><br/>_Stran._ Were I to taunt a buffalo with this<br/>Cloven foot of thine, or the swift dromedary<br/>With thy Sublime of Humps, the animals<br/>Would revel in the compliment. And yet<br/>Both beings are more swift, more strong, more mighty<br/>In action and endurance than thyself,<br/>And all the fierce and fair of the same kind<br/>With thee. Thy form is natural: 'twas only<br/>Nature's mistaken largess to bestow<br/>The gifts which are of others upon man.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Give me the strength then of the buffalo's foot,<br/>When he spurns high the dust, beholding his<br/>Near enemy; or let me have the long<br/>And patient swiftness of the desert-ship,<br/>The helmless dromedary!--and I'll bear<br/>Thy fiendish sarcasm with a saintly patience.<br/><br/>_Stran._ I will.<br/><br/>_Arn._ (_with surprise_). Thou _canst?_<br/><br/>_Stran._                          Perhaps. Would you aught else?<br/><br/>_Arn._ Thou mockest me.<br/><br/>_Stran._                Not I. Why should I mock<br/>What all are mocking? That's poor sport, methinks.<br/>To talk to thee in human language (for<br/>Thou canst not yet speak mine), the forester<br/>Hunts not the wretched coney, but the boar,<br/>Or wolf, or lion--leaving paltry game<br/>To petty burghers, who leave once a year<br/>Their walls, to fill their household cauldrons with<br/>Such scullion prey. The meanest gibe at thee,--<br/>Now _I_ can mock the mightiest.<br/><br/>_Arn._                           Then waste not<br/>Thy time on me: I seek thee not.<br/><br/>_Stran._                         Your thoughts<br/>Are not far from me. Do not send me back:<br/>I'm not so easily recalled to do<br/>Good service.<br/><br/>_Arn._        What wilt thou do for me?<br/><br/>_Stran._                               Change<br/>Shapes with you, if you will, since yours so irks you;<br/>Or form you to your wish in any shape.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Oh! then you are indeed the Demon, for<br/>Nought else would wittingly wear mine.<br/><br/>_Stran._                               I'll show thee<br/>The brightest which the world e'er bore, and give thee<br/>Thy choice.<br/><br/>_Arn._       On what condition?<br/><br/>_Stran._                       There's a question!<br/>An hour ago you would have given your soul<br/>To look like other men, and now you pause<br/>To wear the form of heroes.<br/><br/>_Arn._                     No; I will not.<br/>I must not compromise my soul.<br/><br/>_Stran._                       What soul,<br/>Worth naming so, would dwell in such a carcase?<br/><br/>_Arn._ 'Tis an aspiring one, whate'er the tenement<br/>In which it is mislodged. But name your compact:<br/>Must it be signed in blood?<br/><br/>_Stran._                   Not in your own.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Whose blood then?<br/><br/>_Stran._                 We will talk of that hereafter.<br/>But I'll be moderate with you, for I see<br/>Great things within you. You shall have no bond<br/>But your own will, no contract save your deeds.<br/>Are you content?<br/><br/>_Arn._           I take thee at thy word.<br/><br/>_Stran._   Now then!--<br/>         [_The Stranger approaches the fountain, and turns to_ ARNOLD.<br/><br/>                      A little of your blood.<br/><br/>_Arn._                                        For what?<br/><br/>_Stran._ To mingle with the magic of the waters,<br/>And make the charm effective.<br/><br/>_Arn._ (_holding out his wounded arm_). Take it all.<br/><br/>_Stran._ Not now. A few drops will suffice for this.<br/><br/>                  [_The Stranger takes some of_ ARNOLD'S _blood in his<br/>                         hand, and casts it into the fountain_.<br/><br/>Shadows of Beauty!<br/>  Shadows of Power!<br/>Rise to your duty--<br/>  This is the hour!<br/>Walk lovely and pliant<br/>  From the depth of this fountain,<br/>As the cloud-shapen giant<br/>  Bestrides the Hartz Mountain.<br/>Come as ye were,<br/>  That our eyes may behold<br/>The model in air<br/>  Of the form I will mould,<br/>Bright as the Iris<br/>  When ether is spanned;--<br/>Such _his_ desire is,                           [_Pointing to_ ARNOLD.<br/>  Such _my_ command!<br/>Demons heroic--<br/>  Demons who wore<br/>The form of the Stoic<br/>  Or sophist of yore--<br/>Or the shape of each victor--<br/>  From Macedon's boy,<br/>To each high Roman's picture,<br/>  Who breathed to destroy--<br/>Shadows of Beauty!<br/>  Shadows of Power!<br/>Up to your duty--<br/>  This is the hour!<br/><br/>                    [_Various phantoms arise from the waters, and pass<br/>                        in succession before the Stranger and_ ARNOLD.<br/><br/>_Arn._ What do I see?<br/><br/>_Stran._              The black-eyed Roman, with<br/>The eagle's beak between those eyes which ne'er<br/>Beheld a conqueror, or looked along<br/>The land he made not Rome's, while Rome became<br/>His, and all theirs who heired his very name.<br/><br/>_Arn._ The phantom's bald; _my_ quest is beauty. Could I<br/>Inherit but his fame with his defects!<br/><br/>_Stran._ His brow was girt with laurels more than hairs.<br/>You see his aspect--choose it, or reject.<br/>I can but promise you his form; his fame<br/>Must be long sought and fought for.<br/><br/>_Arn._                              I will fight, too,<br/>But not as a mock C√¶sar. Let him pass:<br/>His aspect may be fair, but suits me not.<br/><br/>_Stran._ Then you are far more difficult to please<br/>Than Cato's sister, or than Brutus's mother,<br/>Or Cleopatra at sixteen--an age<br/>When love is not less in the eye than heart.<br/>But be it so! Shadow, pass on!<br/>                            [_The phantom of Julius C√¶sar disappears_.<br/><br/>_Arn._                          And can it<br/>Be, that the man who shook the earth is gone,<br/>And left no footstep?<br/><br/>_Stran._             There you err. His substance<br/>Left graves enough, and woes enough, and fame<br/>More than enough to track his memory;<br/>But for his shadow--'tis no more than yours,<br/>Except a little longer and less crooked<br/>I' the sun. Behold another!                [_A second phantom passes_.<br/><br/>_Arn._                     Who is he?<br/><br/>_Stran._ He was the fairest and the bravest of<br/>Athenians. Look upon him well.<br/><br/>_Arn._                             He is<br/>More lovely than the last. How beautiful!<br/><br/>_Stran._ Such was the curled son of Clinias;--wouldst thou<br/>Invest thee with his form?<br/><br/>_Arn._                     Would that I had<br/>Been born with it! But since I may choose further,<br/>I will _look_ further.          [_The shade of Alcibiades disappears_.<br/><br/>_Stran._              Lo! behold again!<br/><br/>_Arn._ What! that low, swarthy, short-nosed, round-eyed satyr,<br/>With the wide nostrils and Silenus' aspect,<br/>The splay feet and low stature! I had better<br/>Remain that which I am.<br/><br/>_Stran._               And yet he was<br/>The earth's perfection of all mental beauty,<br/>And personification of all virtue.<br/>But you reject him?<br/><br/>_Arn._             If his form could bring me<br/>That which redeemed it--no.<br/><br/>_Stran._                     I have no power<br/>To promise that; but you may try, and find it<br/>Easier in such a form--or in your own.<br/><br/>_Arn._ No. I was not born for philosophy,<br/>Though I have that about me which has need on't.<br/>Let him fleet on.<br/><br/>_Stran._          Be air, thou Hemlock-drinker!<br/>                  [_The shadow of Socrates disappears: another rises_.<br/><br/>_Arn._ What's here? whose broad brow and whose curly beard<br/>And manly aspect look like Hercules,<br/>Save that his jocund eye hath more of Bacchus<br/>Than the sad purger of the infernal world,<br/>Leaning dejected on his club of conquest,<br/>As if he knew the worthlessness of those<br/>For whom he had fought.<br/><br/>_Stran._                It was the man who lost<br/>The ancient world for love.<br/><br/>_Arn._                      I cannot blame him,<br/>Since I have risked my soul because I find not<br/>That which he exchanged the earth for.<br/><br/>_Stran._                              Since so far<br/>You seem congenial, will you wear his features?<br/><br/>_Arn._ No. As you leave me choice, I am difficult.<br/>If but to see the heroes I should ne'er<br/>Have seen else, on this side of the dim shore,<br/>Whence they float back before us.<br/><br/>_Stran._                         Hence, Triumvir,<br/>Thy Cleopatra's waiting.<br/>                     [_The shade of Antony disappears: another rises_.<br/><br/>_Arn._                  Who is this?<br/>Who truly looketh like a demigod,<br/>Blooming and bright, with golden hair, and stature,<br/>If not more high than mortal, yet immortal<br/>In all that nameless bearing of his limbs,<br/>Which he wears as the Sun his rays--a something<br/>Which shines from him, and yet is but the flashing<br/>Emanation of a thing more glorious still.<br/>Was _he e'er human only?_<br/><br/>_Stran._                   Let the earth speak,<br/>If there be atoms of him left, or even<br/>Of the more solid gold that formed his urn.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Who was this glory of mankind?<br/><br/>_Stran._                              The shame<br/>Of Greece in peace, her thunderbolt in war--<br/>Demetrius the Macedonian, and<br/>Taker of cities.<br/><br/>_Arn._           Yet one shadow more.<br/><br/>_Stran._ (_addressing the shadow_). Get thee to Lamia's lap!<br/>        [_The shade of Demetrius Poliorcetes vanishes: another rises_.<br/>                                  I'll fit you still,<br/>Fear not, my Hunchback: if the shadows of<br/>That which existed please not your nice taste,<br/>I'll animate the ideal marble, till<br/>Your soul be reconciled to her new garment<br/><br/>_Arn._ Content! I will fix here.<br/><br/>_Stran._                         I must commend<br/>Your choice. The godlike son of the sea-goddess,<br/>The unshorn boy of Peleus, with his locks<br/>As beautiful and clear as the amber waves<br/>Of rich Pactolus, rolled o'er sands of gold,<br/>Softened by intervening crystal, and<br/>Rippled like flowing waters by the wind,<br/>All vowed to Sperchius as they were--behold them!<br/>And _him_--as he stood by Polixena,<br/>With sanctioned and with softened love, before<br/>The altar, gazing on his Trojan bride,<br/>With some remorse within for Hector slain<br/>And Priam weeping, mingled with deep passion<br/>For the sweet downcast virgin, whose young hand<br/>Trembled in _his_ who slew her brother. So<br/>He stood i' the temple! Look upon him as<br/>Greece looked her last upon her best, the instant<br/>Ere Paris' arrow flew.<br/><br/>_Arn._                I gaze upon him<br/>As if I were his soul, whose form shall soon<br/>Envelope mine.<br/><br/>_Stran._       You have done well. The greatest<br/>Deformity should only barter with<br/>The extremest beauty--if the proverb's true<br/>Of mortals, that Extremes meet.<br/><br/>_Arn._                          Come! Be quick!<br/>I am impatient.<br/><br/>_Stran._        As a youthful beauty<br/>Before her glass. _You both_ see what is not,<br/>But dream it is what must be.<br/><br/>_Arn._                        Must I wait?<br/><br/>_Stran._ No; that were a pity. But a word or two:<br/>His stature is twelve cubits; would you so far<br/>Outstep these times, and be a Titan? Or<br/>(To talk canonically) wax a son<br/>Of Anak?<br/><br/>_Arn._ Why not?<br/><br/>_Stran._        Glorious ambition!<br/>I love thee most in dwarfs! A mortal of<br/>Philistine stature would have gladly pared<br/>His own Goliath down to a slight David:<br/>But thou, my manikin, wouldst soar a show<br/>Rather than hero. Thou shalt be indulged,<br/>If such be thy desire; and, yet, by being<br/>A little less removed from present men<br/>In figure, thou canst sway them more; for all<br/>Would rise against thee now, as if to hunt<br/>A new-found Mammoth; and their curs√©d engines,<br/>Their culverins, and so forth, would find way<br/>Through our friend's armour there, with greater ease<br/>Than the Adulterer's arrow through his heel<br/>Which Thetis had forgotten to baptize<br/>In Styx.<br/><br/>_Arn._  Then let it be as thou deem'st best.<br/><br/>_Stran._ Thou shalt be beauteous as the thing thou seest,<br/>And strong as what it was, and----<br/><br/>_Arn._                          I ask not<br/>For Valour, since Deformity is daring.<br/>It is its essence to o'ertake mankind<br/>By heart and soul, and make itself the equal--<br/>Aye, the superior of the rest. There is<br/>A spur in its halt movements, to become<br/>All that the others cannot, in such things<br/>As still are free to both, to compensate<br/>For stepdame Nature's avarice at first.<br/>They woo with fearless deeds the smiles of fortune,<br/>And oft, like Timour the lame Tartar, win them.<br/><br/>_Stran._ Well spoken! And thou doubtless wilt remain<br/>Formed as thou art. I may dismiss the mould<br/>Of shadow, which must turn to flesh, to incase<br/>This daring soul, which could achieve no less<br/>Without it.<br/><br/>_Arn._      Had no power presented me<br/>The possibility of change, I would<br/>Have done the best which spirit may to make<br/>Its way with all Deformity's dull, deadly,<br/>Discouraging weight upon me, like a mountain,<br/>In feeling, on my heart as on my shoulders--<br/>A hateful and unsightly molehill to<br/>The eyes of happier men. I would have looked<br/>On Beauty in that sex which is the type<br/>Of all we know or dream of beautiful,<br/>Beyond the world they brighten, with a sigh--<br/>Not of love, but despair; nor sought to win,<br/>Though to a heart all love, what could not love me<br/>In turn, because of this vile crook√©d clog,<br/>Which makes me lonely. Nay, I could have borne<br/>It all, had not my mother spurned me from her.<br/>The she-bear licks her cubs into a sort<br/>Of shape;--my Dam beheld my shape was hopeless.<br/>Had she exposed me, like the Spartan, ere<br/>I knew the passionate part of life, I had<br/>Been a clod of the valley,--happier nothing<br/>Than what I am. But even thus--the lowest,<br/>Ugliest, and meanest of mankind--what courage<br/>And perseverance could have done, perchance<br/>Had made me something--as it has made heroes<br/>Of the same mould as mine. You lately saw me<br/>Master of my own life, and quick to quit it;<br/>And he who is so is the master of<br/>Whatever dreads to die.<br/><br/>_Stran._               Decide between<br/>What you have been, or will be.<br/><br/>_Arn._                         I have done so.<br/>You have opened brighter prospects to my eyes,<br/>And sweeter to my heart. As I am now,<br/>I might be feared--admired--respected--loved<br/>Of all save those next to me, of whom I<br/>Would be belov√©d. As thou showest me<br/>A choice of forms, I take the one I view.<br/>Haste! haste!<br/><br/>_Stran._      And what shall _I_ wear?<br/><br/>_Arn._                                 Surely, he<br/>Who can command all forms will choose the highest,<br/>Something superior even to that which was<br/>Pelides now before us. Perhaps _his_<br/>Who slew him, that of Paris: or--still higher--<br/>The Poet's God, clothed in such limbs as are<br/>Themselves a poetry.<br/><br/>_Stran._            Less will content me;<br/>For I, too, love a change.<br/><br/>_Arn._                    Your aspect is<br/>Dusky, but not uncomely.<br/><br/>_Stran._                  If I chose,<br/>I might be whiter; but I have a _penchant_<br/>For black--it is so honest, and, besides,<br/>Can neither blush with shame nor pale with fear;<br/>But I have worn it long enough of late,<br/>And now I'll take your figure.<br/><br/>_Arn._                         Mine!<br/><br/>_Stran._                            Yes. You<br/>Shall change with Thetis' son, and I with Bertha,<br/>Your mother's offspring.

You are merry, Sir--what? singing too?<br/><br/>_C√¶sar_.                                         It is<br/>The land of Song--and Canticles you know<br/>Were once my avocation.<br/><br/>_Arn._              Nothing moves you;<br/>You scoff even at your own calamity--<br/>And such calamity! how wert thou fallen<br/>Son of the Morning! and yet Lucifer<br/>Can smile.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._     His shape can--would you have me weep,<br/>In the fair form I wear, to please you?<br/><br/>_Arn._                                 Ah!<br/><br/>_C√¶s._ You are grave--what have you on your spirit!<br/><br/>_Arn._                                               Nothing.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._ How mortals lie by instinct! If you ask<br/>A disappointed courtier--What's the matter?<br/>"Nothing"--an outshone Beauty what has made<br/>Her smooth brow crisp--"Oh, Nothing!"--a young heir<br/>When his Sire has recovered from the Gout,<br/>What ails him? "Nothing!" or a Monarch who<br/>Has heard the truth, and looks imperial on it--<br/>What clouds his royal aspect? "Nothing," "Nothing!"<br/>Nothing--eternal nothing--of these nothings<br/>All are a lie--for all to them are much!<br/>And they themselves alone the real "Nothings."<br/>Your present Nothing, too, is something to you--<br/>What is it?<br/><br/>_Arn._      Know you not?<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                   I only know<br/>What I desire to know! and will not waste<br/>Omniscience upon phantoms. Out with it!<br/>If you seek aid from me--or else be silent.<br/>And eat your thoughts--till they breed snakes within you.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Olimpia!<br/><br/>_C√¶s._          I thought as much--go on.<br/><br/>_Arn._ I thought she had loved me.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                             Blessings on your Creed!<br/>What a good Christian you were found to be!<br/>But what cold Sceptic hath appalled your faith<br/>And transubstantiated to crumbs again<br/>The _body_ of your Credence?<br/><br/>_Arn._                      No one--but--<br/>Each day--each hour--each minute shows me more<br/>And more she loves me not--<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                     Doth she rebel?<br/><br/>_Arn._ No, she is calm, and meek, and silent with me,<br/>And coldly dutiful, and proudly patient--<br/>Endures my Love--not meets it.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                        That seems strange.<br/>You are beautiful and brave! the first is much<br/>For passion--and the rest for Vanity.<br/><br/>_Arn._ I saved her life, too; and her Father's life,<br/>And Father's house from ashes.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                        These are nothing.<br/>You seek for Gratitude--the Philosopher's stone.<br/><br/>_Arn._ And find it not.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                  You cannot find what is not.<br/>But _found_ would it content you? would you owe<br/>To thankfulness what you desire from Passion?<br/>No! No! you would be _loved_--what you call loved--<br/>_Self-loved_--loved for _yourself_--for neither health,<br/>Nor wealth, nor youth, nor power, nor rank, nor beauty--<br/>For these you may be stript of--but _beloved_<br/>As an abstraction--for--you know not what!<br/>These are the wishes of a moderate lover--<br/>And _so_ you love.<br/><br/>_Arn._             Ah! could I be beloved,<br/>Would I ask wherefore?<br/><br/>_C√¶s._               Yes! and not believe<br/>The answer--You are jealous.<br/><br/>_Arn._                       And of whom?<br/><br/>_C√¶s._ It may be of yourself, for Jealousy<br/>Is as a shadow of the Sun. The Orb<br/>Is mighty--as you mortals deem--and to<br/>Your little Universe seems universal;<br/>But, great as He appears, and is to you,<br/>The smallest cloud--the slightest vapour of<br/>Your humid earth enables you to look<br/>Upon a Sky which you revile as dull;<br/>Though your eyes dare not gaze on it when cloudless.<br/>Nothing can blind a mortal like to light.<br/>Now Love in you is as the Sun--a thing<br/>Beyond you--and your Jealousy's of Earth--<br/>A cloud of your own raising.<br/><br/>_Arn._                       Not so always!<br/>There is a cause at times.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._                    Oh, yes! when atoms jostle,<br/>The System is in peril. But I speak<br/>Of things you know not. Well, to earth again!<br/>This precious thing of dust--this bright Olimpia--<br/>This marvellous Virgin, is a marble maid--<br/>An Idol, but a cold one to your heat<br/>Promethean, and unkindled by your torch.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Slave!<br/><br/>_C√¶s._         In the victor's Chariot, when Rome triumphed,<br/>There was a Slave of yore to tell him truth!<br/>You are a Conqueror--command your Slave.<br/><br/>_Arn._ Teach me the way to win the woman's love.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._ Leave her.<br/><br/>_Arn._            Where that the path--I'd not pursue it.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._ No doubt! for if you did, the remedy<br/>Would be for a disease already cured.<br/><br/>_Arn._ All wretched as I am, I would not quit<br/>My unrequited love, for all that's happy.<br/><br/>_C√¶s._ You have possessed the woman--still possess.<br/>What need you more?<br/><br/>_Arn._         To be myself possessed--<br/>To be her heart as she is mine.
