# üíÆ Beppo: A Venetian Story by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    _Rosalind_. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; Look, you lisp,<br/>and wear strange suits: disable all the benefits of your own<br/>country; be out of love with your Nativity, and almost chide<br/>God for making you that countenance you are; or I will<br/>scarce think you have swam in a _Gondola_.<br/><br/>                         _As You Like It_, act iv, sc. I, lines 33-35.<br/><br/>                _Annotation of the Commentators_.<br/>  That is, _been at Venice_, which was much visited by the young English<br/>  gentlemen of those times, and was _then_ what _Paris_ is _now_--the seat<br/>  of all dissoluteness.--S. A.<br/><br/>'Tis known, at least it should be, that throughout<br/>  All countries of the Catholic persuasion,<br/>Some weeks before Shrove Tuesday comes about,<br/>  The People take their fill of recreation,<br/>And buy repentance, ere they grow devout,<br/>  However high their rank, or low their station,<br/>With fiddling, feasting, dancing, drinking, masquing,<br/>And other things which may be had for asking.<br/><br/>The moment night with dusky mantle covers<br/>  The skies (and the more duskily the better),<br/>The Time less liked by husbands than by lovers<br/>  Begins, and Prudery flings aside her fetter;<br/>And Gaiety on restless tiptoe hovers,<br/>  Giggling with all the gallants who beset her;<br/>And there are songs and quavers, roaring, humming,<br/>Guitars, and every other sort of strumming.<br/><br/>And there are dresses splendid, but fantastical,<br/>  Masks of all times and nations, Turks and Jews,<br/>And harlequins and clowns, with feats gymnastical,<br/>  Greeks, Romans, Yankee-doodles, and Hindoos;<br/>All kinds of dress, except the ecclesiastical,<br/>  All people, as their fancies hit, may choose,<br/>But no one in these parts may quiz the Clergy,--<br/>Therefore take heed, ye Freethinkers! I charge ye.<br/><br/>You'd better walk about begirt with briars,<br/>  Instead of coat and smallclothes, than put on<br/>A single stitch reflecting upon friars,<br/>  Although you swore it only was in fun;<br/>They'd haul you o'er the coals, and stir the fires<br/>  Of Phlegethon with every mother's son,<br/>Nor say one mass to cool the cauldron's bubble<br/>That boiled your bones, unless you paid them double.<br/><br/>But saving this, you may put on whate'er<br/>  You like by way of doublet, cape, or cloak,<br/>Such as in Monmouth-street, or in Rag Fair,<br/>  Would rig you out in seriousness or joke;<br/>And even in Italy such places are,<br/>  With prettier name in softer accents spoke,<br/>For, bating Covent Garden, I can hit on<br/>No place that's called "Piazza" in Great Britain.<br/><br/>This feast is named the Carnival, which being<br/>  Interpreted, implies "farewell to flesh:"<br/>So called, because the name and thing agreeing,<br/>  Through Lent they live on fish both salt and fresh.<br/>But why they usher Lent with so much glee in,<br/>  Is more than I can tell, although I guess<br/>'Tis as we take a glass with friends at parting,<br/>In the Stage-Coach or Packet, just at starting.<br/><br/>And thus they bid farewell to carnal dishes,<br/>  And solid meats, and highly spiced ragouts,<br/>To live for forty days on ill-dressed fishes,<br/>  Because they have no sauces to their stews;<br/>A thing which causes many "poohs" and "pishes,"<br/>  And several oaths (which would not suit the Muse),<br/>From travellers accustomed from a boy<br/>To eat their salmon, at the least, with soy;<br/><br/>And therefore humbly I would recommend<br/>  "The curious in fish-sauce," before they cross<br/>The sea, to bid their cook, or wife, or friend,<br/>   Walk or ride to the Strand, and buy in gross<br/>(Or if set out beforehand, these may send<br/>   By any means least liable to loss),<br/>Ketchup, Soy, Chili-vinegar, and Harvey,<br/>Or, by the Lord! a Lent will well nigh starve ye;<br/><br/>That is to say, if your religion's Roman,<br/>  And you at Rome would do as Romans do,<br/>According to the proverb,--although no man,<br/>  If foreign, is obliged to fast; and you,<br/>If Protestant, or sickly, or a woman,<br/>  Would rather dine in sin on a ragout--<br/>Dine and be d--d! I don't mean to be coarse,<br/>But that's the penalty, to say no worse.<br/><br/>Of all the places where the Carnival<br/>  Was most facetious in the days of yore,<br/>For dance, and song, and serenade, and ball,<br/>  And Masque, and Mime, and Mystery, and more<br/>Than I have time to tell now, or at all,<br/>  Venice the bell from every city bore,--<br/>And at the moment when I fix my story,<br/>That sea-born city was in all her glory.<br/><br/>They've pretty faces yet, those same Venetians,<br/>  Black eyes, arched brows, and sweet expressions still;<br/>Such as of old were copied from the Grecians,<br/>  In ancient arts by moderns mimicked ill;<br/>And like so many Venuses of Titian's<br/>  (The best's at Florence--see it, if ye will,)<br/>They look when leaning over the balcony,<br/>Or stepped from out a picture by Giorgione,<br/><br/>Whose tints are Truth and Beauty at their best;<br/>  And when you to Manfrini's palace go,<br/>That picture (howsoever fine the rest)<br/>  Is loveliest to my mind of all the show;<br/>It may perhaps be also to _your_ zest,<br/>  And that's the cause I rhyme upon it so:<br/>Tis but a portrait of his Son, and Wife,<br/>And self; but _such_ a Woman! Love in life!<br/><br/>Love in full life and length, not love ideal,<br/>  No, nor ideal beauty, that fine name,<br/>But something better still, so very real,<br/>  That the sweet Model must have been the same;<br/>A thing that you would purchase, beg, or steal,<br/>  Wer't not impossible, besides a shame:<br/>The face recalls some face, as 'twere with pain,<br/>You once have seen, but ne'er will see again;<br/><br/>One of those forms which flit by us, when we<br/>  Are young, and fix our eyes on every face;<br/>And, oh! the Loveliness at times we see<br/>  In momentary gliding, the soft grace,<br/>The Youth, the Bloom, the Beauty which agree,<br/>  In many a nameless being we retrace,<br/>Whose course and home we knew not, nor shall know,<br/>Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below.<br/><br/>I said that like a picture by Giorgione<br/>  Venetian women were, and so they _are_,<br/>Particularly seen from a balcony,<br/>  (For beauty's sometimes best set off afar)<br/>And there, just like a heroine of Goldoni,<br/>  They peep from out the blind, or o'er the bar;<br/>And truth to say, they're mostly very pretty,<br/>And rather like to show it, more's the pity!<br/><br/>For glances beget ogles, ogles sighs,<br/>  Sighs wishes, wishes words, and words a letter,<br/>Which flies on wings of light-heeled Mercuries,<br/>  Who do such things because they know no better;<br/>And then, God knows what mischief may arise,<br/>  When Love links two young people in one fetter,<br/>Vile assignations, and adulterous beds,<br/>Elopements, broken vows, and hearts, and heads.<br/><br/>Shakspeare described the sex in Desdemona<br/>  As very fair, but yet suspect in fame,<br/>And to this day from Venice to Verona<br/>  Such matters may be probably the same,<br/>Except that since those times was never known a<br/>  Husband whom mere suspicion could inflame<br/>To suffocate a wife no more than twenty,<br/>Because she had a "Cavalier Servente."<br/><br/>Their jealousy (if they are ever jealous)<br/>  Is of a fair complexion altogether,<br/>Not like that sooty devil of Othello's,<br/>  Which smothers women in a bed of feather,<br/>But worthier of these much more jolly fellows,<br/>  When weary of the matrimonial tether<br/>His head for such a wife no mortal bothers,<br/>But takes at once another, or _another's_.<br/><br/>Didst ever see a Gondola? For fear<br/>  You should not, I'll describe it you exactly:<br/>'Tis a long covered boat that's common here,<br/>  Carved at the prow, built lightly, but compactly,<br/>Rowed by two rowers, each call'd "Gondolier,"<br/>  It glides along the water looking blackly,<br/>Just like a coffin clapt in a canoe,<br/>Where none can make out what you say or do.<br/><br/>And up and down the long canals they go,<br/>  And under the Rialto shoot along,<br/>By night and day, all paces, swift or slow,<br/>  And round the theatres, a sable throng,<br/>They wait in their dusk livery of woe,--<br/>  But not to them do woeful things belong,<br/>For sometimes they contain a deal of fun,<br/>Like mourning coaches when the funeral's done.<br/><br/>But to my story.--'Twas some years ago,<br/>  It may be thirty, forty, more or less,<br/>The Carnival was at its height, and so<br/>  Were all kinds of buffoonery and dress;<br/>A certain lady went to see the show,<br/>  Her real name I know not, nor can guess,<br/>And so we'll call her Laura, if you please,<br/>Because it slips into my verse with ease.<br/><br/>She was not old, nor young, nor at the years<br/>  Which certain people call a "_certain age_,"<br/>Which yet the most uncertain age appears,<br/>  Because I never heard, nor could engage<br/>A person yet by prayers, or bribes, or tears,<br/>  To name, define by speech, or write on page,<br/>The period meant precisely by that word,--<br/>Which surely is exceedingly absurd.<br/><br/>Laura was blooming still, had made the best<br/>  Of Time, and Time returned the compliment,<br/>And treated her genteelly, so that, dressed,<br/>  She looked extremely well where'er she went;<br/>A pretty woman is a welcome guest,<br/>  And Laura's brow a frown had rarely bent;<br/>Indeed, she shone all smiles, and seemed to flatter<br/>Mankind with her black eyes for looking at her.<br/><br/>She was a married woman; 'tis convenient,<br/>  Because in Christian countries 'tis a rule<br/>To view their little slips with eyes more lenient;<br/>  Whereas if single ladies play the fool,<br/>(Unless within the period intervenient<br/>  A well-timed wedding makes the scandal cool)<br/>I don't know how they ever can get over it,<br/>Except they manage never to discover it.<br/><br/>Her husband sailed upon the Adriatic,<br/>  And made some voyages, too, in other seas,<br/>And when he lay in Quarantine for pratique<br/>  (A forty days' precaution 'gainst disease),<br/>His wife would mount, at times, her highest attic,<br/>  For thence she could discern the ship with ease:<br/>He was a merchant trading to Aleppo,<br/>His name Giuseppe, called more briefly, Beppo.<br/><br/>He was a man as dusky as a Spaniard,<br/>  Sunburnt with travel, yet a portly figure;<br/>Though coloured, as it were, within a tanyard,<br/>  He was a person both of sense and vigour--<br/>A better seaman never yet did man yard;<br/>  And she, although her manners showed no rigour,<br/>Was deemed a woman of the strictest principle,<br/>So much as to be thought almost invincible.<br/><br/>But several years elapsed since they had met;<br/>  Some people thought the ship was lost, and some<br/>That he had somehow blundered into debt,<br/>  And did not like the thought of steering home;<br/>And there were several offered any bet,<br/>  Or that he would, or that he would not come;<br/>For most men (till by losing rendered sager)<br/>Will back their own opinions with a wager.<br/><br/>'Tis said that their last parting was pathetic,<br/>  As partings often are, or ought to be,<br/>And their presentiment was quite prophetic,<br/>  That they should never more each other see,<br/>(A sort of morbid feeling, half poetic,<br/>  Which I have known occur in two or three,)<br/>When kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee<br/>He left this Adriatic Ariadne.<br/><br/>And Laura waited long, and wept a little,<br/>  And thought of wearing weeds, as well she might;<br/>She almost lost all appetite for victual,<br/>  And could not sleep with ease alone at night;<br/>She deemed the window-frames and shutters brittle<br/>  Against a daring housebreaker or sprite,<br/>And so she thought it prudent to connect her<br/>With a vice-husband, _chiefly_ to _protect her_.<br/><br/>She chose, (and what is there they will not choose,<br/>  If only you will but oppose their choice?)<br/>Till Beppo should return from his long cruise,<br/>  And bid once more her faithful heart rejoice,<br/>A man some women like, and yet abuse--<br/>  A Coxcomb was he by the public voice;<br/>A Count of wealth, they said as well as quality,<br/>And in his pleasures of great liberality.<br/><br/>And then he was a Count, and then he knew<br/>  Music, and dancing, fiddling, French and Tuscan;<br/>The last not easy, be it known to you,<br/>  For few Italians speak the right Etruscan.<br/>He was a critic upon operas, too,<br/>  And knew all niceties of sock and buskin;<br/>And no Venetian audience could endure a<br/>Song, scene, or air, when he cried "seccatura!"<br/><br/>His "bravo" was decisive, for that sound<br/>  Hushed "Academie" sighed in silent awe;<br/>The fiddlers trembled as he looked around,<br/>  For fear of some false note's detected flaw;<br/>The "Prima Donna's" tuneful heart would bound,<br/>  Dreading the deep damnation of his "Bah!"<br/>Soprano, Basso, even the Contra-Alto,<br/>Wished him five fathom under the Rialto.<br/><br/>He patronised the Improvisatori,<br/>  Nay, could himself extemporise some stanzas,<br/>Wrote rhymes, sang songs, could also tell a story,<br/>  Sold pictures, and was skilful in the dance as<br/>Italians can be, though in this their glory<br/>  Must surely yield the palm to that which France has;<br/>In short, he was a perfect Cavaliero,<br/>And to his very valet seemed a hero.<br/><br/>Then he was faithful too, as well as amorous;<br/>  So that no sort of female could complain,<br/>Although they're now and then a little clamorous,<br/>  He never put the pretty souls in pain;<br/>His heart was one of those which most enamour us,<br/>  Wax to receive, and marble to retain:<br/>He was a lover of the good old school,<br/>Who still become more constant as they cool.<br/><br/>No wonder such accomplishments should turn<br/>  A female head, however sage and steady--<br/>With scarce a hope that Beppo could return,<br/>  In law he was almost as good as dead, he<br/>Nor sent, nor wrote, nor showed the least concern,<br/>  And she had waited several years already:<br/>And really if a man won't let us know<br/>That he's alive, he's _dead_--or should be so.<br/><br/>Besides, within the Alps, to every woman,<br/>  (Although, God knows, it is a grievous sin,)<br/>'Tis, I may say, permitted to have _two_ men;<br/>  I can't tell who first brought the custom in,<br/>But "Cavalier Serventes" are quite common,<br/>  And no one notices or cares a pin;<br/>An we may call this (not to say the worst)<br/>A _second_ marriage which corrupts the _first_.<br/><br/>The word was formerly a "Cicisbeo,"<br/>  But _that_ is now grown vulgar and indecent;<br/>The Spaniards call the person a "_Cortejo_,"<br/>  For the same mode subsists in Spain, though recent;<br/>In short it reaches from the Po to Teio,<br/>  And may perhaps at last be o'er the sea sent:<br/>But Heaven preserve Old England from such courses!<br/>Or what becomes of damage and divorces?<br/><br/>However, I still think, with all due deference<br/>  To the fair _single_ part of the creation,<br/>That married ladies should preserve the preference<br/>  In _t√™te √† t√™te_ or general conversation--<br/>And this I say without peculiar reference<br/>  To England, France, or any other nation--<br/>Because they know the world, and are at ease,<br/>And being natural, naturally please.<br/><br/>'Tis true, your budding Miss is very charming,<br/>  But shy and awkward at first coming out,<br/>So much alarmed, that she is quite alarming,<br/>  All Giggle, Blush; half Pertness, and half Pout;<br/>And glancing at _Mamma_, for fear there's harm in<br/>  What you, she, it, or they, may be about:<br/>The Nursery still lisps out in all they utter--<br/>Besides, they always smell of bread and butter.<br/><br/>But "Cavalier Servente" is the phrase<br/>  Used in politest circles to express<br/>This supernumerary slave, who stays<br/>  Close to the lady as a part of dress,<br/>Her word the only law which he obeys.<br/>  His is no sinecure, as you may guess;<br/>Coach, servants, gondola, he goes to call,<br/>And carries fan and tippet, gloves and shawl.<br/><br/>With all its sinful doings, I must say,<br/>  That Italy's a pleasant place to me,<br/>Who love to see the Sun shine every day,<br/>  And vines (not nailed to walls) from tree to tree<br/>Festooned, much like the back scene of a play,<br/>  Or melodrame, which people flock to see,<br/>When the first act is ended by a dance<br/>In vineyards copied from the South of France.<br/><br/>I like on Autumn evenings to ride out,<br/>  Without being forced to bid my groom be sure<br/>My cloak is round his middle strapped about,<br/>  Because the skies are not the most secure;<br/>I know too that, if stopped upon my route,<br/>  Where the green alleys windingly allure,<br/>Reeling with _grapes_ red wagons choke the way,--<br/>In England 'twould be dung, dust, or a dray.<br/><br/>I also like to dine on becaficas,<br/>  To see the Sun set, sure he'll rise to-morrow,<br/>Not through a misty morning twinkling weak as<br/>  A drunken man's dead eye in maudlin sorrow,<br/>But with all Heaven t'himself; the day will break as<br/>  Beauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow<br/>That sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers<br/>Where reeking London's smoky cauldron simmers.<br/><br/>I love the language, that soft bastard Latin,<br/>  Which melts like kisses from a female mouth,<br/>And sounds as if it should be writ on satin,<br/>  With syllables which breathe of the sweet South,<br/>And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in,<br/>  That not a single accent seems uncouth,<br/>Like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural,<br/>Which we're obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.<br/><br/>I like the women too (forgive my folly!),<br/>  From the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronze,<br/>And large black eyes that flash on you a volley<br/>  Of rays that say a thousand things at once,<br/>To the high Dama's brow, more melancholy,<br/>  But clear, and with a wild and liquid glance,<br/>Heart on her lips, and soul within her eyes,<br/>Soft as her clime, and sunny as her skies.<br/><br/>Eve of the land which still is Paradise!<br/>  Italian Beauty didst thou not inspire<br/>Raphael, who died in thy embrace, and vies<br/>  With all we know of Heaven, or can desire,<br/>In what he hath bequeathed us?--in what guise,<br/>  Though flashing from the fervour of the Lyre,<br/>Would _words_ describe thy past and present glow,<br/>While yet Canova can create below?<br/><br/>"England! with all thy faults I love thee still,"<br/>  I said at Calais, and have not forgot it;<br/>I like to speak and lucubrate my fill;<br/>  I like the government (but that is not it);<br/>I like the freedom of the press and quill;<br/>  I like the Habeas Corpus (when we've got it);<br/>I like a Parliamentary debate,<br/>Particularly when 'tis not too late;<br/><br/>I like the taxes, when they're not too many;<br/>  I like a seacoal fire, when not too dear;<br/>I like a beef-steak, too, as well as any;<br/>  Have no objection to a pot of beer;<br/>I like the weather,--when it is not rainy,<br/>  That is, I like two months of every year.<br/>And so God save the Regent, Church, and King!<br/>Which means that I like all and every thing.<br/><br/>Our standing army, and disbanded seamen,<br/>  Poor's rate, Reform, my own, the nation's debt,<br/>Our little riots just to show we're free men,<br/>  Our trifling bankruptcies in the Gazette,<br/>Our cloudy climate, and our chilly women,<br/>  All these I can forgive, and those forget,<br/>And greatly venerate our recent glories,<br/>And wish they were not owing to the Tories.<br/><br/>But to my tale of Laura,--for I find<br/>  Digression is a sin, that by degrees<br/>Becomes exceeding tedious to my mind,<br/>  And, therefore, may the reader too displease--<br/>The gentle reader, who may wax unkind,<br/>  And caring little for the Author's ease,<br/>Insist on knowing what he means--a hard<br/>And hapless situation for a Bard.<br/><br/>Oh! that I had the art of easy writing<br/>  What should be easy reading! could I scale<br/>Parnassus, where the Muses sit inditing<br/>  Those pretty poems never known to fail,<br/>How quickly would I print (the world delighting)<br/>  A Grecian, Syrian, or _Ass_yrian tale;<br/>And sell you, mixed with western Sentimentalism,<br/>Some samples of the _finest Orientalism._<br/><br/>But I am but a nameless sort of person,<br/>  (A broken Dandy lately on my travels)<br/>And take for rhyme, to hook my rambling verse on,<br/>  The first that Walker's Lexicon unravels,<br/>And when I can't find that, I put a worse on,<br/>  Not caring as I ought for critics' cavils;<br/>I've half a mind to tumble down to prose,<br/>But verse is more in fashion--so here goes!<br/><br/>The Count and Laura made their new arrangement,<br/>  Which lasted, as arrangements sometimes do,<br/>For half a dozen years without estrangement;<br/>  They had their little differences, too;<br/>Those jealous whiffs, which never any change meant;<br/>  In such affairs there probably are few<br/>Who have not had this pouting sort of squabble,<br/>From sinners of high station to the rabble.<br/><br/>But, on the whole, they were a happy pair,<br/>  As happy as unlawful love could make them;<br/>The gentleman was fond, the lady fair,<br/>  Their chains so slight, 'twas not worth while to break them:<br/>The World beheld them with indulgent air;<br/>  The pious only wished "the Devil take them!"<br/>He took them not; he very often waits,<br/>And leaves old sinners to be young ones' baits.<br/><br/>But they were young: Oh! what without our Youth<br/>  Would Love be! What would Youth be without Love!<br/>Youth lends its joy, and sweetness, vigour, truth,<br/>  Heart, soul, and all that seems as from above;<br/>But, languishing with years, it grows uncouth--<br/>  One of few things Experience don't improve;<br/>Which is, perhaps, the reason why old fellows<br/>Are always so preposterously jealous.<br/><br/>It was the Carnival, as I have said<br/>  Some six and thirty stanzas back, and so<br/>Laura the usual preparations made,<br/>  Which you do when your mind's made up to go<br/>To-night to Mrs. Boehm's masquerade,<br/>  Spectator, or Partaker in the show;<br/>The only difference known between the cases<br/>Is--_here_, we have six weeks of "varnished faces."<br/><br/>Laura, when dressed, was (as I sang before)<br/>  A pretty woman as was ever seen,<br/>Fresh as the Angel o'er a new inn door,<br/>  Or frontispiece of a new Magazine,<br/>With all the fashions which the last month wore,<br/>  Coloured, and silver paper leaved between<br/>That and the title-page, for fear the Press<br/>Should soil with parts of speech the parts of dress.<br/><br/>They went to the Ridotto; 'tis a hall<br/>  Where People dance, and sup, and dance again;<br/>Its proper name, perhaps, were a masqued ball,<br/>  But that's of no importance to my strain;<br/>'Tis (on a smaller scale) like our Vauxhall,<br/>  Excepting that it can't be spoilt by rain;<br/>The company is "mixed" (the phrase I quote is<br/>As much as saying, they're below your notice);<br/><br/>For a "mixed company" implies that, save<br/>  Yourself and friends, and half a hundred more,<br/>Whom you may bow to without looking grave,<br/>  The rest are but a vulgar set, the Bore<br/>Of public places, where they basely brave<br/>  The fashionable stare of twenty score<br/>Of well-bred persons, called "_The World_;" but I,<br/>Although I know them, really don't know why.<br/><br/>This is the case in England; at least was<br/>  During the dynasty of Dandies, now<br/>Perchance succeeded by some other class<br/>  Of imitated Imitators:--how<br/>Irreparably soon decline, alas!<br/>  The Demagogues of fashion: all below<br/>Is frail; how easily the world is lost<br/>By Love, or War, and, now and then,--by Frost!<br/><br/>Crushed was Napoleon by the northern Thor,<br/>  Who knocked his army down with icy hammer,<br/>Stopped by the _Elements_--like a Whaler--or<br/>  A blundering novice in his new French grammar;<br/>Good cause had he to doubt the chance of war,<br/>  And as for Fortune--but I dare not d--n her,<br/>Because, were I to ponder to Infinity,<br/>The more I should believe in her Divinity.<br/><br/>She rules the present, past, and all to be yet,<br/>  She gives us luck in lotteries, love, and marriage;<br/>I cannot say that she's done much for me yet;<br/>  Not that I mean her bounties to disparage,<br/>We've not yet closed accounts, and we shall see yet<br/>  How much she'll make amends for past miscarriage;<br/>Meantime the Goddess I'll no more importune,<br/>Unless to thank her when she's made my fortune.<br/><br/>To turn,--and to return;--the Devil take it!<br/>  This story slips for ever through my fingers,<br/>Because, just as the stanza likes to make it,<br/>  It needs must be--and so it rather lingers;<br/>This form of verse began, I can't well break it,<br/>  But must keep time and tune like public singers;<br/>But if I once get through my present measure,<br/>I'll take another when I'm next at leisure.<br/><br/>They went to the Ridotto ('tis a place<br/>  To which I mean to go myself to-morrow,<br/>Just to divert my thoughts a little space<br/>  Because I'm rather hippish, and may borrow<br/>Some spirits, guessing at what kind of face<br/>  May lurk beneath each mask; and as my sorrow<br/>Slackens its pace sometimes, I'll make, or find,<br/>Something shall leave it half an hour behind.)<br/><br/>Now Laura moves along the joyous crowd,<br/>  Smiles in her eyes, and simpers on her lips;<br/>To some she whispers, others speaks aloud;<br/>  To some she curtsies, and to some she dips,<br/>Complains of warmth, and this complaint avowed,<br/>  Her lover brings the lemonade, she sips;<br/>She then surveys, condemns, but pities still<br/>Her dearest friends for being dressed so ill.<br/><br/>One has false curls, another too much paint,<br/>  A third--where did she buy that frightful turban?<br/>A fourth's so pale she fears she's going to faint,<br/>  A fifth's look's vulgar, dowdyish, and suburban,<br/>A sixth's white silk has got a yellow taint,<br/>  A seventh's thin muslin surely will be her bane,<br/>And lo! an eighth appears,--"I'll see no more!"<br/>For fear, like Banquo's kings, they reach a score.<br/><br/>Meantime, while she was thus at others gazing,<br/>  Others were levelling their looks at her;<br/>She heard the men's half-whispered mode of praising<br/>  And, till 'twas done, determined not to stir;<br/>The women only thought it quite amazing<br/>  That, at her time of life, so many were<br/>Admirers still,--but "Men are so debased,<br/>Those brazen Creatures always suit their taste."<br/><br/>For my part, now, I ne'er could understand<br/>  Why naughty women--but I won't discuss<br/>A thing which is a scandal to the land,<br/>  I only don't see why it should be thus;<br/>And if I were but in a gown and band,<br/>  Just to entitle me to make a fuss,<br/>I'd preach on this till Wilberforce and Romilly<br/>Should quote in their next speeches from my homily.<br/><br/>While Laura thus was seen, and seeing, smiling,<br/>  Talking, she knew not why, and cared not what,<br/>So that her female friends, with envy broiling,<br/>  Beheld her airs, and triumph, and all that;<br/>And well-dressed males still kept before her filing,<br/>  And passing bowed and mingled with her chat;<br/>More than the rest one person seemed to stare<br/>With pertinacity that's rather rare.<br/><br/>He was a Turk, the colour of mahogany;<br/>  And Laura saw him, and at first was glad,<br/>Because the Turks so much admire philogyny,<br/>  Although their usage of their wives is sad;<br/>'Tis said they use no better than a dog any<br/>  Poor woman, whom they purchase like a pad:<br/>They have a number, though they ne'er exhibit 'em,<br/>Four wives by law, and concubines "ad libitum."<br/><br/>They lock them up, and veil, and guard them daily,<br/>  They scarcely can behold their male relations,<br/>So that their moments do not pass so gaily<br/>  As is supposed the case with northern nations;<br/>Confinement, too, must make them look quite palely;<br/>  And as the Turks abhor long conversations,<br/>Their days are either passed in doing nothing,<br/>Or bathing, nursing, making love, and clothing.<br/><br/>They cannot read, and so don't lisp in criticism;<br/>  Nor write, and so they don't affect the Muse;<br/>Were never caught in epigram or witticism,<br/>  Have no romances, sermons, plays, reviews,--<br/>In Harams learning soon would make a pretty schism,<br/>  But luckily these Beauties are no "Blues;"<br/>No bustling _Botherby_ have they to show 'em<br/>"That charming passage in the last new poem:"<br/><br/>No solemn, antique gentleman of rhyme,<br/>  Who having angled all his life for Fame,<br/>And getting but a nibble at a time,<br/>  Still fussily keeps fishing on, the same<br/>Small "Triton of the minnows," the sublime<br/>  Of Mediocrity, the furious tame,<br/>The Echo's echo, usher of the school<br/>Of female wits, boy bards--in short, a fool!<br/><br/>A stalking oracle of awful phrase,<br/>  The approving _"Good!"_ (by no means good in law)<br/>Humming like flies around the newest blaze,<br/>  The bluest of bluebottles you e'er saw,<br/>Teasing with blame, excruciating with praise,<br/>  Gorging the little fame he gets all raw,<br/>Translating tongues he knows not even by letter,<br/>And sweating plays so middling, bad were better.<br/><br/>One hates an author that's _all author_--fellows<br/>  In foolscap uniforms turned up with ink,<br/>So very anxious, clever, fine, and jealous,<br/>  One don't know what to say to them, or think,<br/>Unless to puff them with a pair of bellows;<br/>  Of Coxcombry's worst coxcombs e'en the pink<br/>Are preferable to these shreds of paper,<br/>These unquenched snuffings of the midnight taper.<br/><br/>Of these same we see several, and of others.<br/>  Men of the world, who know the World like Men,<br/>Scott, Rogers, Moore, and all the better brothers,<br/>  Who think of something else besides the pen;<br/>But for the children of the "Mighty Mother's,"<br/>  The would-be wits, and can't-be gentlemen,<br/>I leave them to their daily "tea is ready,"<br/>Smug coterie, and literary lady.<br/><br/>The poor dear Mussul_women_ whom I mention<br/>  Have none of these instructive pleasant people,<br/>And _one_ would seem to them a new invention,<br/>  Unknown as bells within a Turkish steeple;<br/>I think 'twould almost be worth while to pension<br/>  (Though best-sown projects very often reap ill)<br/>A missionary author--just to preach<br/>Our Christian usage of the parts of speech.<br/><br/>No Chemistry for them unfolds her gases,<br/>  No Metaphysics are let loose in lectures,<br/>No Circulating Library amasses<br/>  Religious novels, moral tales, and strictures<br/>Upon the living manners, as they pass us;<br/>  No Exhibition glares with annual pictures;<br/>They stare not on the stars from out their attics,<br/>Nor deal (thank God for that!) in Mathematics.<br/><br/>Why I thank God for that is no great matter,<br/>  I have my reasons, you no doubt suppose,<br/>And as, perhaps, they would not highly flatter,<br/>  I'll keep them for my life (to come) in prose;<br/>I fear I have a little turn for Satire,<br/>  And yet methinks the older that one grows<br/>Inclines us more to laugh than scold, though Laughter<br/>Leaves us so doubly serious shortly after.<br/><br/>Oh, Mirth and Innocence! Oh, Milk and Water!<br/>  Ye happy mixtures of more happy days!<br/>In these sad centuries of sin and slaughter,<br/>  Abominable Man no more allays<br/>His thirst with such pure beverage. No matter,<br/>  I love you both, and both shall have my praise:<br/>Oh, for old Saturn's reign of sugar-candy!---<br/>Meantime I drink to your return in brandy.<br/><br/>Our Laura's Turk still kept his eyes upon her,<br/>  Less in the Mussulman than Christian way,<br/>Which seems to say, "Madam, I do you honour,<br/>  And while I please to stare, you'll please to stay."<br/>Could staring win a woman, this had won her,<br/>  But Laura could not thus be led astray;<br/>She had stood fire too long and well, to boggle<br/>Even at this Stranger's most outlandish ogle.<br/><br/>The morning now was on the point of breaking,<br/>  A turn of time at which I would advise<br/>Ladies who have been dancing, or partaking<br/>  In any other kind of exercise,<br/>To make their preparations for forsaking<br/>  The ball-room ere the Sun begins to rise,<br/>Because when once the lamps and candles fail,<br/>His blushes make them look a little pale.<br/><br/>I've seen some balls and revels in my time,<br/>  And stayed them over for some silly reason,<br/>And then I looked (I hope it was no crime)<br/>  To see what lady best stood out the season;<br/>And though I've seen some thousands in their prime<br/>  Lovely and pleasing, and who still may please on,<br/>I never saw but one (the stars withdrawn)<br/>Whose bloom could after dancing dare the Dawn.<br/><br/>The name of this Aurora I'll not mention,<br/>  Although I might, for she was nought to me<br/>More than that patent work of God's invention,<br/>  A charming woman, whom we like to see;<br/>But writing names would merit reprehension,<br/>  Yet if you like to find out this fair _She,_<br/>At the next London or Parisian ball<br/>You still may mark her cheek, out-blooming all.<br/><br/>Laura, who knew it would not do at all<br/>  To meet the daylight after seven hours' sitting<br/>Among three thousand people at a ball,<br/>  To make her curtsey thought it right and fitting;<br/>The Count was at her elbow with her shawl,<br/>  And they the room were on the point of quitting,<br/>When lo! those curs√©d Gondoliers had got<br/>Just in the very place where they _should not._<br/><br/>In this they're like our coachmen, and the cause<br/>  Is much the same--the crowd, and pulling, hauling,<br/>With blasphemies enough to break their jaws,<br/>  They make a never intermitted bawling.<br/>At home, our Bow-street gem'men keep the laws,<br/>  And here a sentry stands within your calling;<br/>But for all that, there is a deal of swearing,<br/>And nauseous words past mentioning or bearing.<br/><br/>The Count and Laura found their boat at last,<br/>  And homeward floated o'er the silent tide,<br/>Discussing all the dances gone and past;<br/>  The dancers and their dresses, too, beside;<br/>Some little scandals eke; but all aghast<br/>  (As to their palace-stairs the rowers glide)<br/>Sate Laura by the side of her adorer,<br/>When lo! the Mussulman was there before her!<br/><br/>"Sir," said the Count, with brow exceeding grave,<br/>  "Your unexpected presence here will make<br/>It necessary for myself to crave<br/>  Its import? But perhaps 'tis a mistake;<br/>I hope it is so; and, at once to waive<br/>  All compliment, I hope so for _your_ sake;<br/>You understand my meaning, or you _shall._"<br/>"Sir," (quoth the Turk) "'tis no mistake at all:<br/><br/>"That Lady is _my wife!_" Much wonder paints<br/>  The lady's changing cheek, as well it might;<br/>But where an Englishwoman sometimes faints,<br/>  Italian females don't do so outright;<br/>They only call a little on their Saints,<br/>  And then come to themselves, almost, or quite;<br/>Which saves much hartshorn, salts, and sprinkling faces,<br/>And cutting stays, as usual in such cases.<br/><br/>She said,--what could she say? Why, not a word;<br/>  But the Count courteously invited in<br/>The Stranger, much appeased by what he heard:<br/>  "Such things, perhaps, we'd best discuss within,"<br/>Said he; "don't let us make ourselves absurd<br/>  In public, by a scene, nor raise a din,<br/>For then the chief and only satisfaction<br/>Will be much quizzing on the whole transaction."<br/><br/>They entered, and for Coffee called--it came,<br/>  A beverage for Turks and Christians both,<br/>Although the way they make it's not the same.<br/>  Now Laura, much recovered, or less loth<br/>To speak, cries "Beppo! what's your pagan name?<br/>  Bless me! your beard is of amazing growth!<br/>And how came you to keep away so long?<br/>Are you not sensible 'twas very wrong?<br/><br/>"And are you _really, truly,_ now a Turk?<br/>  With any other women did you wive?<br/>Is't true they use their fingers for a fork?<br/>  Well, that's the prettiest Shawl--as I'm alive!<br/>You'll give it me? They say you eat no pork.<br/>  And how so many years did you contrive<br/>To--Bless me! did I ever? No, I never<br/>Saw a man grown so yellow! How's your liver?<br/><br/>"Beppo! that beard of yours becomes you not;<br/>  It shall be shaved before you're a day older:<br/>Why do you wear it? Oh! I had forgot--<br/>  Pray don't you think the weather here is colder?<br/>How do I look? You shan't stir from this spot<br/>  In that queer dress, for fear that some beholder<br/>Should find you out, and make the story known.<br/>How short your hair is! Lord! how grey it's grown!"<br/><br/>What answer Beppo made to these demands<br/>  Is more than I know. He was cast away<br/>About where Troy stood once, and nothing stands;<br/>  Became a slave of course, and for his pay<br/>Had bread and bastinadoes, till some bands<br/>  Of pirates landing in a neighbouring bay,<br/>He joined the rogues and prospered, and became<br/>A renegade of indifferent fame.<br/><br/>But he grew rich, and with his riches grew so<br/>  Keen the desire to see his home again,<br/>He thought himself in duty bound to do so,<br/>  And not be always thieving on the main;<br/>Lonely he felt, at times, as Robin Crusoe,<br/>  And so he hired a vessel come from Spain,<br/>Bound for Corfu: she was a fine polacca,<br/>Manned with twelve hands, and laden with tobacco.<br/><br/>Himself, and much (heaven knows how gotten!) cash,<br/>  He then embarked, with risk of life and limb,<br/>And got clear off, although the attempt was rash;<br/>  _He_ said that _Providence_ protected him--<br/>For my part, I say nothing--lest we clash<br/>  In our opinions:--well--the ship was trim,<br/>Set sail, and kept her reckoning fairly on,<br/>Except three days of calm when off Cape Bonn.<br/><br/>They reached the Island, he transferred his lading,<br/>  And self and live stock to another bottom,<br/>And passed for a true Turkey-merchant, trading<br/>  With goods of various names--but I've forgot 'em.<br/>However, he got off by this evading,<br/>  Or else the people would perhaps have shot him;<br/>And thus at Venice landed to reclaim<br/>His wife, religion, house, and Christian name.<br/><br/>His wife received, the Patriarch re-baptised him,<br/>  (He made the Church a present, by the way;)<br/>He then threw off the garments which disguised him,<br/>  And borrowed the Count's smallclothes for a day:<br/>His friends the more for his long absence prized him,<br/>  Finding he'd wherewithal to make them gay,<br/>With dinners, where he oft became the laugh of them,<br/>For stories--but _I_ don't believe the half of them.<br/><br/>Whate'er his youth had suffered, his old age<br/>  With wealth and talking made him some amends;<br/>Though Laura sometimes put him in a rage,<br/>  I've heard the Count and he were always friends.<br/>My pen is at the bottom of a page,<br/>  Which being finished, here the story ends:<br/>'Tis to be wished it had been sooner done,<br/>But stories somehow lengthen when begun.
