# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 02 by *John Milton*

<p>
    High on a throne of royal state, which far<br/>Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind,<br/>Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand<br/>Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,<br/>Satan exalted sat, by merit raised<br/>To that bad eminence; and, from despair<br/>Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br/>Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br/>Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,<br/>His proud imaginations thus displayed:--<br/>  "Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!--<br/>For, since no deep within her gulf can hold<br/>Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,<br/>I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent<br/>Celestial Virtues rising will appear<br/>More glorious and more dread than from no fall,<br/>And trust themselves to fear no second fate!--<br/>Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven,<br/>Did first create your leader--next, free choice<br/>With what besides in council or in fight<br/>Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss,<br/>Thus far at least recovered, hath much more<br/>Established in a safe, unenvied throne,<br/>Yielded with full consent. The happier state<br/>In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw<br/>Envy from each inferior; but who here<br/>Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br/>Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim<br/>Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br/>Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good<br/>For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br/>From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell<br/>Precedence; none whose portion is so small<br/>Of present pain that with ambitious mind<br/>Will covet more! With this advantage, then,<br/>To union, and firm faith, and firm accord,<br/>More than can be in Heaven, we now return<br/>To claim our just inheritance of old,<br/>Surer to prosper than prosperity<br/>Could have assured us; and by what best way,<br/>Whether of open war or covert guile,<br/>We now debate. Who can advise may speak."<br/>  He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king,<br/>Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br/>That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.<br/>His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed<br/>Equal in strength, and rather than be less<br/>Cared not to be at all; with that care lost<br/>Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse,<br/>He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:--<br/>  "My sentence is for open war. Of wiles,<br/>More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br/>Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.<br/>For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest--<br/>Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait<br/>The signal to ascend--sit lingering here,<br/>Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place<br/>Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame,<br/>The prison of his ryranny who reigns<br/>By our delay? No! let us rather choose,<br/>Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once<br/>O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way,<br/>Turning our tortures into horrid arms<br/>Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise<br/>Of his almighty engine, he shall hear<br/>Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see<br/>Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br/>Among his Angels, and his throne itself<br/>Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,<br/>His own invented torments. But perhaps<br/>The way seems difficult, and steep to scale<br/>With upright wing against a higher foe!<br/>Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br/>Of that forgetful lake benumb not still,<br/>That in our porper motion we ascend<br/>Up to our native seat; descent and fall<br/>To us is adverse. Who but felt of late,<br/>When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear<br/>Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep,<br/>With what compulsion and laborious flight<br/>We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then;<br/>Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke<br/>Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br/>To our destruction, if there be in Hell<br/>Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse<br/>Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned<br/>In this abhorred deep to utter woe!<br/>Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br/>Must exercise us without hope of end<br/>The vassals of his anger, when the scourge<br/>Inexorably, and the torturing hour,<br/>Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus,<br/>We should be quite abolished, and expire.<br/>What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br/>His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged,<br/>Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br/>To nothing this essential--happier far<br/>Than miserable to have eternal being!--<br/>Or, if our substance be indeed divine,<br/>And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br/>On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br/>Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,<br/>And with perpetual inroads to alarm,<br/>Though inaccessible, his fatal throne:<br/>Which, if not victory, is yet revenge."<br/>  He ended frowning, and his look denounced<br/>Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous<br/>To less than gods. On th' other side up rose<br/>Belial, in act more graceful and humane.<br/>A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed<br/>For dignity composed, and high exploit.<br/>But all was false and hollow; though his tongue<br/>Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear<br/>The better reason, to perplex and dash<br/>Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low--<br/> To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds<br/>Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,<br/>And with persuasive accent thus began:--<br/>  "I should be much for open war, O Peers,<br/>As not behind in hate, if what was urged<br/>Main reason to persuade immediate war<br/>Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast<br/>Ominous conjecture on the whole success;<br/>When he who most excels in fact of arms,<br/>In what he counsels and in what excels<br/>Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br/>And utter dissolution, as the scope<br/>Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br/>First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled<br/>With armed watch, that render all access<br/>Impregnable: oft on the bodering Deep<br/>Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing<br/>Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,<br/>Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way<br/>By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br/>With blackest insurrection to confound<br/>Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy,<br/>All incorruptible, would on his throne<br/>Sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould,<br/>Incapable of stain, would soon expel<br/>Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,<br/>Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope<br/>Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br/>Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage;<br/>And that must end us; that must be our cure--<br/>To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose,<br/>Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br/>Those thoughts that wander through eternity,<br/>To perish rather, swallowed up and lost<br/>In the wide womb of uncreated Night,<br/>Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows,<br/>Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br/>Can give it, or will ever? How he can<br/>Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br/>Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br/>Belike through impotence or unaware,<br/>To give his enemies their wish, and end<br/>Them in his anger whom his anger saves<br/>To punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?'<br/>Say they who counsel war; 'we are decreed,<br/>Reserved, and destined to eternal woe;<br/>Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br/>What can we suffer worse?' Is this, then, worst--<br/>Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?<br/>What when we fled amain, pursued and struck<br/>With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought<br/>The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed<br/>A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay<br/>Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.<br/>What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,<br/>Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,<br/>And plunge us in the flames; or from above<br/>Should intermitted vengeance arm again<br/>His red right hand to plague us? What if all<br/>Her stores were opened, and this firmament<br/>Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,<br/>Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall<br/>One day upon our heads; while we perhaps,<br/>Designing or exhorting glorious war,<br/>Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,<br/>Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey<br/>Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br/>Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,<br/>There to converse with everlasting groans,<br/>Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,<br/>Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.<br/>War, therefore, open or concealed, alike<br/>My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile<br/>With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye<br/>Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height<br/>All these our motions vain sees and derides,<br/>Not more almighty to resist our might<br/>Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br/>Shall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven<br/>Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here<br/>Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,<br/>By my advice; since fate inevitable<br/>Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,<br/>The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do,<br/>Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust<br/>That so ordains. This was at first resolved,<br/>If we were wise, against so great a foe<br/>Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br/>I laugh when those who at the spear are bold<br/>And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear<br/>What yet they know must follow--to endure<br/>Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain,<br/>The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now<br/>Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br/>Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit<br/>His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,<br/>Not mind us not offending, satisfied<br/>With what is punished; whence these raging fires<br/>Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.<br/>Our purer essence then will overcome<br/>Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;<br/>Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed<br/>In temper and in nature, will receive<br/>Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain,<br/>This horror will grow mild, this darkness light;<br/>Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br/>Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br/>Worth waiting--since our present lot appears<br/>For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br/>If we procure not to ourselves more woe."<br/>  Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb,<br/>Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,<br/>Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:--<br/>  "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven<br/>We war, if war be best, or to regain<br/>Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then<br/>May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield<br/>To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.<br/>The former, vain to hope, argues as vain<br/>The latter; for what place can be for us<br/>Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme<br/>We overpower? Suppose he should relent<br/>And publish grace to all, on promise made<br/>Of new subjection; with what eyes could we<br/>Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br/>Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne<br/>With warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing<br/>Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits<br/>Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes<br/>Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,<br/>Our servile offerings? This must be our task<br/>In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome<br/>Eternity so spent in worship paid<br/>To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,<br/>By force impossible, by leave obtained<br/>Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state<br/>Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek<br/>Our own good from ourselves, and from our own<br/>Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,<br/>Free and to none accountable, preferring<br/>Hard liberty before the easy yoke<br/>Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear<br/>Then most conspicuous when great things of small,<br/>Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,<br/>We can create, and in what place soe'er<br/>Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br/>Through labour and endurance. This deep world<br/>Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst<br/>Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire<br/>Choose to reside, his glory unobscured,<br/>And with the majesty of darkness round<br/>Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.<br/>Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!<br/>As he our darkness, cannot we his light<br/>Imitate when we please? This desert soil<br/>Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;<br/>Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise<br/>Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?<br/>Our torments also may, in length of time,<br/>Become our elements, these piercing fires<br/>As soft as now severe, our temper changed<br/>Into their temper; which must needs remove<br/>The sensible of pain. All things invite<br/>To peaceful counsels, and the settled state<br/>Of order, how in safety best we may<br/>Compose our present evils, with regard<br/>Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br/>All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise."<br/>  He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled<br/>Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain<br/>The sound of blustering winds, which all night long<br/>Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br/>Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance<br/>Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay<br/>After the tempest. Such applause was heard<br/>As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,<br/>Advising peace: for such another field<br/>They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear<br/>Of thunder and the sword of Michael<br/>Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br/>To found this nether empire, which might rise,<br/>By policy and long process of time,<br/>In emulation opposite to Heaven.<br/>Which when Beelzebub perceived--than whom,<br/>Satan except, none higher sat--with grave<br/>Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed<br/>A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven<br/>Deliberation sat, and public care;<br/>And princely counsel in his face yet shone,<br/>Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood<br/>With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear<br/>The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look<br/>Drew audience and attention still as night<br/>Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:--<br/>  "Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven,<br/>Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now<br/>Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called<br/>Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br/>Inclines--here to continue, and build up here<br/>A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream,<br/>And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed<br/>This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat<br/>Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt<br/>From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league<br/>Banded against his throne, but to remain<br/>In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,<br/>Under th' inevitable curb, reserved<br/>His captive multitude. For he, to be sure,<br/>In height or depth, still first and last will reign<br/>Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part<br/>By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br/>His empire, and with iron sceptre rule<br/>Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.<br/>What sit we then projecting peace and war?<br/>War hath determined us and foiled with loss<br/>Irreparable; terms of peace yet none<br/>Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given<br/>To us enslaved, but custody severe,<br/>And stripes and arbitrary punishment<br/>Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br/>But, to our power, hostility and hate,<br/>Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,<br/>Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least<br/>May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice<br/>In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br/>Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br/>With dangerous expedition to invade<br/>Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,<br/>Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find<br/>Some easier enterprise? There is a place<br/>(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven<br/>Err not)--another World, the happy seat<br/>Of some new race, called Man, about this time<br/>To be created like to us, though less<br/>In power and excellence, but favoured more<br/>Of him who rules above; so was his will<br/>Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath<br/>That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed.<br/>Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br/>What creatures there inhabit, of what mould<br/>Or substance, how endued, and what their power<br/>And where their weakness: how attempted best,<br/>By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,<br/>And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure<br/>In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,<br/>The utmost border of his kingdom, left<br/>To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,<br/>Some advantageous act may be achieved<br/>By sudden onset--either with Hell-fire<br/>To waste his whole creation, or possess<br/>All as our own, and drive, as we were driven,<br/>The puny habitants; or, if not drive,<br/>Seduce them to our party, that their God<br/>May prove their foe, and with repenting hand<br/>Abolish his own works. This would surpass<br/>Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br/>In our confusion, and our joy upraise<br/>In his disturbance; when his darling sons,<br/>Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br/>Their frail original, and faded bliss--<br/>Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth<br/>Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br/>Hatching vain empires." Thus beelzebub<br/>Pleaded his devilish counsel--first devised<br/>By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,<br/>But from the author of all ill, could spring<br/>So deep a malice, to confound the race<br/>Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br/>To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br/>The great Creator? But their spite still serves<br/>His glory to augment. The bold design<br/>Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy<br/>Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent<br/>They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:--<br/>"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,<br/>Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are,<br/>Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep<br/>Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate,<br/>Nearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view<br/>Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms,<br/>And opportune excursion, we may chance<br/>Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone<br/>Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light,<br/>Secure, and at the brightening orient beam<br/>Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air,<br/>To heal the scar of these corrosive fires,<br/>Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send<br/>In search of this new World? whom shall we find<br/>Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet<br/>The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,<br/>And through the palpable obscure find out<br/>His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight,<br/>Upborne with indefatigable wings<br/>Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br/>The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then<br/>Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe,<br/>Through the strict senteries and stations thick<br/>Of Angels watching round? Here he had need<br/>All circumspection: and we now no less<br/>Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send<br/>The weight of all, and our last hope, relies."<br/>  This said, he sat; and expectation held<br/>His look suspense, awaiting who appeared<br/>To second, or oppose, or undertake<br/>The perilous attempt. But all sat mute,<br/>Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each<br/>In other's countenance read his own dismay,<br/>Astonished. None among the choice and prime<br/>Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found<br/>So hardy as to proffer or accept,<br/>Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last,<br/>Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised<br/>Above his fellows, with monarchal pride<br/>Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:--<br/>  "O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones!<br/>With reason hath deep silence and demur<br/>Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way<br/>And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.<br/>Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire,<br/>Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br/>Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant,<br/>Barred over us, prohibit all egress.<br/>These passed, if any pass, the void profound<br/>Of unessential Night receives him next,<br/>Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being<br/>Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.<br/>If thence he scape, into whatever world,<br/>Or unknown region, what remains him less<br/>Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?<br/>But I should ill become this throne, O Peers,<br/>And this imperial sovereignty, adorned<br/>With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed<br/>And judged of public moment in the shape<br/>Of difficulty or danger, could deter<br/>Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume<br/>These royalties, and not refuse to reign,<br/>Refusing to accept as great a share<br/>Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br/>To him who reigns, and so much to him due<br/>Of hazard more as he above the rest<br/>High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,<br/>Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,<br/>While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br/>The present misery, and render Hell<br/>More tolerable; if there be cure or charm<br/>To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain<br/>Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch<br/>Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad<br/>Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br/>Deliverance for us all. This enterprise<br/>None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose<br/>The Monarch, and prevented all reply;<br/>Prudent lest, from his resolution raised,<br/>Others among the chief might offer now,<br/>Certain to be refused, what erst they feared,<br/>And, so refused, might in opinion stand<br/>His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br/>Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they<br/>Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice<br/>Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.<br/>Their rising all at once was as the sound<br/>Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend<br/>With awful reverence prone, and as a God<br/>Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.<br/>Nor failed they to express how much they praised<br/>That for the general safety he despised<br/>His own: for neither do the Spirits damned<br/>Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast<br/>Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br/>Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.<br/>  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark<br/>Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:<br/>As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds<br/>Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread<br/>Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element<br/>Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower,<br/>If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,<br/>Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,<br/>The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds<br/>Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.<br/>O shame to men! Devil with devil damned<br/>Firm concord holds; men only disagree<br/>Of creatures rational, though under hope<br/>Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,<br/>Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife<br/>Among themselves, and levy cruel wars<br/>Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:<br/>As if (which might induce us to accord)<br/>Man had not hellish foes enow besides,<br/>That day and night for his destruction wait!<br/>  The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth<br/>In order came the grand infernal Peers:<br/>Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed<br/>Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less<br/>Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,<br/>And god-like imitated state: him round<br/>A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed<br/>With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.<br/>Then of their session ended they bid cry<br/>With trumpet's regal sound the great result:<br/>Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br/>Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,<br/>By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss<br/>Heard far adn wide, and all the host of Hell<br/>With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.<br/>Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised<br/>By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers<br/>Disband; and, wandering, each his several way<br/>Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br/>Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find<br/>Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br/>The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br/>Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,<br/>Upon the wing or in swift race contend,<br/>As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields;<br/>Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal<br/>With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:<br/>As when, to warn proud cities, war appears<br/>Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush<br/>To battle in the clouds; before each van<br/>Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,<br/>Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms<br/>From either end of heaven the welkin burns.<br/>Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,<br/>Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air<br/>In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:--<br/>As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned<br/>With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore<br/>Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,<br/>And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw<br/>Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild,<br/>Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br/>With notes angelical to many a harp<br/>Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall<br/>By doom of battle, and complain that Fate<br/>Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br/>Their song was partial; but the harmony<br/>(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br/>Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br/>The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet<br/>(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)<br/>Others apart sat on a hill retired,<br/>In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high<br/>Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate--<br/>Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br/>And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.<br/>Of good and evil much they argued then,<br/>Of happiness and final misery,<br/>Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:<br/>Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!--<br/>Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm<br/>Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br/>Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast<br/>With stubborn patience as with triple steel.<br/>Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,<br/>On bold adventure to discover wide<br/>That dismal world, if any clime perhaps<br/>Might yield them easier habitation, bend<br/>Four ways their flying march, along the banks<br/>Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge<br/>Into the burning lake their baleful streams--<br/>Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;<br/>Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;<br/>Cocytus, named of lamentation loud<br/>Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,<br/>Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br/>Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,<br/>Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls<br/>Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks<br/>Forthwith his former state and being forgets--<br/>Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.<br/>Beyond this flood a frozen continent<br/>Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms<br/>Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land<br/>Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems<br/>Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,<br/>A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog<br/>Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,<br/>Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air<br/>Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.<br/>Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,<br/>At certain revolutions all the damned<br/>Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change<br/>Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,<br/>From beds of raging fire to starve in ice<br/>Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine<br/>Immovable, infixed, and frozen round<br/>Periods of time,--thence hurried back to fire.<br/>They ferry over this Lethean sound<br/>Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,<br/>And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach<br/>The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose<br/>In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,<br/>All in one moment, and so near the brink;<br/>But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt,<br/>Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards<br/>The ford, and of itself the water flies<br/>All taste of living wight, as once it fled<br/>The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on<br/>In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands,<br/>With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,<br/>Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found<br/>No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale<br/>They passed, and many a region dolorous,<br/>O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,<br/>Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death--<br/>A universe of death, which God by curse<br/>Created evil, for evil only good;<br/>Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,<br/>Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br/>Obominable, inutterable, and worse<br/>Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,<br/>Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.<br/>  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,<br/>Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,<br/>Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell<br/>Explores his solitary flight: sometimes<br/>He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;<br/>Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars<br/>Up to the fiery concave towering high.<br/>As when far off at sea a fleet descried<br/>Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds<br/>Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles<br/>Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring<br/>Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,<br/>Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,<br/>Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed<br/>Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear<br/>Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,<br/>And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,<br/>Three iron, three of adamantine rock,<br/>Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,<br/>Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat<br/>On either side a formidable Shape.<br/>The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,<br/>But ended foul in many a scaly fold,<br/>Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed<br/>With mortal sting. About her middle round<br/>A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked<br/>With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung<br/>A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,<br/>If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,<br/>And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled<br/>Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these<br/>Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts<br/>Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;<br/>Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called<br/>In secret, riding through the air she comes,<br/>Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance<br/>With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon<br/>Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape--<br/>If shape it might be called that shape had none<br/>Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;<br/>Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,<br/>For each seemed either--black it stood as Night,<br/>Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,<br/>And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head<br/>The likeness of a kingly crown had on.<br/>Satan was now at hand, and from his seat<br/>The monster moving onward came as fast<br/>With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.<br/>Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired--<br/>Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,<br/>Created thing naught valued he nor shunned),<br/>And with disdainful look thus first began:--<br/>  "Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,<br/>That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance<br/>Thy miscreated front athwart my way<br/>To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,<br/>That be assured, without leave asked of thee.<br/>Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,<br/>Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven."<br/>  To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:--<br/>"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he,<br/>Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then<br/>Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms<br/>Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons,<br/>Conjured against the Highest--for which both thou<br/>And they, outcast from God, are here condemned<br/>To waste eternal days in woe and pain?<br/>And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven<br/>Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,<br/>Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,<br/>Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,<br/>False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,<br/>Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue<br/>Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart<br/>Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before."<br/>  So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape,<br/>So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold,<br/>More dreadful and deform. On th' other side,<br/>Incensed with indignation, Satan stood<br/>Unterrified, and like a comet burned,<br/>That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge<br/>In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair<br/>Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head<br/>Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands<br/>No second stroke intend; and such a frown<br/>Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds,<br/>With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on<br/>Over the Caspian,--then stand front to front<br/>Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow<br/>To join their dark encounter in mid-air.<br/>So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell<br/>Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;<br/>For never but once more was wither like<br/>To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds<br/>Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,<br/>Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat<br/>Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,<br/>Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.<br/>  "O father, what intends thy hand," she cried,<br/>"Against thy only son? What fury, O son,<br/>Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart<br/>Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom?<br/>For him who sits above, and laughs the while<br/>At thee, ordained his drudge to execute<br/>Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids--<br/>His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!"<br/>  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest<br/>Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:--<br/>  "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange<br/>Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,<br/>Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds<br/>What it intends, till first I know of thee<br/>What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why,<br/>In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st<br/>Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son.<br/>I know thee not, nor ever saw till now<br/>Sight more detestable than him and thee."<br/>  T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:--<br/>"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem<br/>Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair<br/>In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight<br/>Of all the Seraphim with thee combined<br/>In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King,<br/>All on a sudden miserable pain<br/>Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum<br/>In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast<br/>Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,<br/>Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,<br/>Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,<br/>Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized<br/>All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid<br/>At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign<br/>Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,<br/>I pleased, and with attractive graces won<br/>The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft<br/>Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,<br/>Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st<br/>With me in secret that my womb conceived<br/>A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,<br/>And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained<br/>(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe<br/>Clear victory; to our part loss and rout<br/>Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell,<br/>Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down<br/>Into this Deep; and in the general fall<br/>I also: at which time this powerful key<br/>Into my hands was given, with charge to keep<br/>These gates for ever shut, which none can pass<br/>Without my opening. Pensive here I sat<br/>Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb,<br/>Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,<br/>Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.<br/>At last this odious offspring whom thou seest,<br/>Thine own begotten, breaking violent way,<br/>Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain<br/>Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br/>Transformed: but he my inbred enemy<br/>Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,<br/>Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!<br/>Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed<br/>From all her caves, and back resounded Death!<br/>I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,<br/>Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,<br/>Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,<br/>And, in embraces forcible and foul<br/>Engendering with me, of that rape begot<br/>These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry<br/>Surround me, as thou saw'st--hourly conceived<br/>And hourly born, with sorrow infinite<br/>To me; for, when they list, into the womb<br/>That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw<br/>My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth<br/>Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,<br/>That rest or intermission none I find.<br/>Before mine eyes in opposition sits<br/>Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,<br/>And me, his parent, would full soon devour<br/>For want of other prey, but that he knows<br/>His end with mine involved, and knows that I<br/>Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,<br/>Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.<br/>But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun<br/>His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope<br/>To be invulnerable in those bright arms,<br/>Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,<br/>Save he who reigns above, none can resist."<br/>  She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore<br/>Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:--<br/>  "Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire,<br/>And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge<br/>Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys<br/>Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change<br/>Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of--know,<br/>I come no enemy, but to set free<br/>From out this dark and dismal house of pain<br/>Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host<br/>Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed,<br/>Fell with us from on high. From them I go<br/>This uncouth errand sole, and one for all<br/>Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread<br/>Th' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense<br/>To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold<br/>Should be--and, by concurring signs, ere now<br/>Created vast and round--a place of bliss<br/>In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed<br/>A race of upstart creatures, to supply<br/>Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed,<br/>Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude,<br/>Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught<br/>Than this more secret, now designed, I haste<br/>To know; and, this once known, shall soon return,<br/>And bring ye to the place where thou and Death<br/>Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen<br/>Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed<br/>With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled<br/>Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey."<br/>  He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death<br/>Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear<br/>His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw<br/>Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced<br/>His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:--<br/>  "The key of this infernal Pit, by due<br/>And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King,<br/>I keep, by him forbidden to unlock<br/>These adamantine gates; against all force<br/>Death ready stands to interpose his dart,<br/>Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might.<br/>But what owe I to his commands above,<br/>Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down<br/>Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,<br/>To sit in hateful office here confined,<br/>Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born--<br/>Here in perpetual agony and pain,<br/>With terrors and with clamours compassed round<br/>Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?<br/>Thou art my father, thou my author, thou<br/>My being gav'st me; whom should I obey<br/>But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon<br/>To that new world of light and bliss, among<br/>The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign<br/>At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems<br/>Thy daughter and thy darling, without end."<br/>  Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,<br/>Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;<br/>And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,<br/>Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,<br/>Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers<br/>Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns<br/>Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar<br/>Of massy iron or solid rock with ease<br/>Unfastens. On a sudden open fly,<br/>With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,<br/>Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate<br/>Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook<br/>Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut<br/>Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood,<br/>That with extended wings a bannered host,<br/>Under spread ensigns marching, mibht pass through<br/>With horse and chariots ranked in loose array;<br/>So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth<br/>Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.<br/>Before their eyes in sudden view appear<br/>The secrets of the hoary Deep--a dark<br/>Illimitable ocean, without bound,<br/>Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height,<br/>And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night<br/>And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold<br/>Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise<br/>Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.<br/>For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,<br/>Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring<br/>Their embryon atoms: they around the flag<br/>Of each his faction, in their several clans,<br/>Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,<br/>Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands<br/>Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,<br/>Levied to side with warring winds, and poise<br/>Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere<br/>He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,<br/>And by decision more embroils the fray<br/>By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,<br/>Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss,<br/>The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,<br/>Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,<br/>But all these in their pregnant causes mixed<br/>Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,<br/>Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain<br/>His dark materials to create more worlds--<br/>Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend<br/>Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,<br/>Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith<br/>He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed<br/>With noises loud and ruinous (to compare<br/>Great things with small) than when Bellona storms<br/>With all her battering engines, bent to rase<br/>Some capital city; or less than if this frame<br/>Of Heaven were falling, and these elements<br/>In mutiny had from her axle torn<br/>The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans<br/>He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke<br/>Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,<br/>As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides<br/>Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets<br/>A vast vacuity. All unawares,<br/>Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops<br/>Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour<br/>Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance,<br/>The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,<br/>Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him<br/>As many miles aloft. That fury stayed--<br/>Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,<br/>Nor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fares,<br/>Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,<br/>Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.<br/>As when a gryphon through the wilderness<br/>With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale,<br/>Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth<br/>Had from his wakeful custody purloined<br/>The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend<br/>O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br/>With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,<br/>And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.<br/>At length a universal hubbub wild<br/>Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,<br/>Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear<br/>With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies<br/>Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power<br/>Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss<br/>Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask<br/>Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies<br/>Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne<br/>Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread<br/>Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned<br/>Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,<br/>The consort of his reign; and by them stood<br/>Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name<br/>Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,<br/>And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,<br/>And Discord with a thousand various mouths.<br/>  T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:--"Ye Powers<br/>And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss,<br/>Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy<br/>With purpose to explore or to disturb<br/>The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint<br/>Wandering this darksome desert, as my way<br/>Lies through your spacious empire up to light,<br/>Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek,<br/>What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds<br/>Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place,<br/>From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King<br/>Possesses lately, thither to arrive<br/>I travel this profound. Direct my course:<br/>Directed, no mean recompense it brings<br/>To your behoof, if I that region lost,<br/>All usurpation thence expelled, reduce<br/>To her original darkness and your sway<br/>(Which is my present journey), and once more<br/>Erect the standard there of ancient Night.<br/>Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!"<br/>  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,<br/>With faltering speech and visage incomposed,<br/>Answered:  "I know thee, stranger, who thou art--  ***<br/>That mighty leading Angel, who of late<br/>Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown.<br/>I saw and heard; for such a numerous host<br/>Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep,<br/>With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,<br/>Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates<br/>Poured out by millions her victorious bands,<br/>Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here<br/>Keep residence; if all I can will serve<br/>That little which is left so to defend,<br/>Encroached on still through our intestine broils<br/>Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,<br/>Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;<br/>Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world<br/>Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain<br/>To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!<br/>If that way be your walk, you have not far;<br/>So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;<br/>Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain."<br/>  He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply,<br/>But, glad that now his sea should find a shore,<br/>With fresh alacrity and force renewed<br/>Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire,<br/>Into the wild expanse, and through the shock<br/>Of fighting elements, on all sides round<br/>Environed, wins his way; harder beset<br/>And more endangered than when Argo passed<br/>Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,<br/>Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned<br/>Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered.<br/>So he with difficulty and labour hard<br/>Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;<br/>But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,<br/>Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain,<br/>Following his track (such was the will of Heaven)<br/>Paved after him a broad and beaten way<br/>Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf<br/>Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,<br/>From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb<br/>Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse<br/>With easy intercourse pass to and fro<br/>To tempt or punish mortals, except whom<br/>God and good Angels guard by special grace.<br/>  But now at last the sacred influence<br/>Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven<br/>Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night<br/>A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins<br/>Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire,<br/>As from her outmost works, a broken foe,<br/>With tumult less and with less hostile din;<br/>That Satan with less toil, and now with ease,<br/>Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light,<br/>And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds<br/>Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;<br/>Or in the emptier waste, resembling air,<br/>Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold<br/>Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide<br/>In circuit, undetermined square or round,<br/>With opal towers and battlements adorned<br/>Of living sapphire, once his native seat;<br/>And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,<br/>This pendent World, in bigness as a star<br/>Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.<br/>Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,<br/>Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.
