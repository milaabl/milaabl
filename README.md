# üíÆ The Prayer of Nature by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Father of Light! great God of Heaven!<br/>  Hear'st thou the accents of despair?<br/>Can guilt like man's be e'er forgiven?<br/>  Can vice atone for crimes by prayer?<br/><br/>Father of Light, on thee I call!<br/>  Thou see'st my soul is dark within;<br/>Thou, who canst mark the sparrow's fall,<br/>  Avert from me the death of sin.<br/><br/>No shrine I seek, to sects unknown;<br/>  Oh, point to me the path of truth!<br/>Thy dread Omnipotence I own;<br/>  Spare, yet amend, the faults of youth.<br/><br/>Let bigots rear a gloomy fane,<br/>  Let Superstition hail the pile,<br/>Let priests, to spread their sable reign,<br/>  With tales of mystic rites beguile.<br/><br/>Shall man confine his Maker's sway<br/>  To Gothic domes of mouldering stone?<br/>Thy temple is the face of day;<br/>  Earth, Ocean, Heaven thy boundless throne.<br/><br/>Shall man condemn his race to Hell,<br/>  Unless they bend in pompous form?<br/>Tell us that all, for one who fell,<br/>  Must perish in the mingling storm?<br/><br/>Shall each pretend to reach the skies,<br/>  Yet doom his brother to expire,<br/>Whose soul a different hope supplies,<br/>  Or doctrines less severe inspire?<br/><br/>Shall these, by creeds they can't expound,<br/>  Prepare a fancied bliss or woe?<br/>Shall reptiles, groveling on the ground,<br/>  Their great Creator's purpose know?<br/><br/>Shall those, who live for self alone,<br/>  Whose years float on in daily crime--<br/>Shall they, by Faith, for guilt atone,<br/>  And live beyond the bounds of Time?<br/><br/>Father! no prophet's laws I seek,--<br/>  _Thy_ laws in Nature's works appear;--<br/>I own myself corrupt and weak,<br/>  Yet will I _pray_, for thou wilt hear!<br/><br/>Thou, who canst guide the wandering star,<br/>  Through trackless realms of aether's space;<br/>Who calm'st the elemental war,<br/>  Whose hand from pole to pole I trace:<br/><br/>Thou, who in wisdom plac'd me here,<br/>  Who, when thou wilt, canst take me hence,<br/>Ah! whilst I tread this earthly sphere,<br/>  Extend to me thy wide defence.<br/><br/>To Thee, my God, to thee I call!<br/>  Whatever weal or woe betide,<br/>By thy command I rise or fall,<br/>  In thy protection I confide.<br/><br/>If, when this dust to dust's restor'd,<br/>  My soul shall float on airy wing,<br/>How shall thy glorious Name ador'd<br/>  Inspire her feeble voice to sing!<br/><br/>But, if this fleeting spirit share<br/>  With clay the Grave's eternal bed,<br/>While Life yet throbs I raise my prayer,<br/>  Though doom'd no more to quit the dead.<br/><br/>To Thee I breathe my humble strain,<br/>  Grateful for all thy mercies past,<br/>And hope, my God, to thee again<br/>  This erring life may fly at last.
</p>
