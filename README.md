# üíÆ Jubilate Agno: Fragment B, Part 4 by *Christopher Smart*

<p>
    For God has given us a language of monosyllables to prevent our clipping.<br/><br/>For a toad enjoys a finer prospect than another creature to compensate his lack.<br/><br/>Tho' toad I am the object of man's hate.<br/>Yet better am I than a reprobate. who has the worst of prospects.<br/>For there are stones, whose constituent particles are little toads.<br/><br/>For the spiritual musick is as follows.<br/><br/>For there is the thunder-stop, which is the voice of God direct.<br/><br/>For the rest of the stops are by their rhimes.<br/><br/>For the trumpet rhimes are sound bound, soar more and the like.<br/><br/>For the Shawm rhimes are lawn fawn moon boon and the like.<br/><br/>For the harp rhimes are sing ring string and the like.<br/><br/>For the cymbal rhimes are bell well toll soul and the like.<br/><br/>For the flute rhimes are tooth youth suit mute and the like.<br/><br/>For the dulcimer rhimes are grace place beat heat and the like.<br/><br/>For the Clarinet rhimes are clean seen and the like.<br/><br/>For the Bassoon rhimes are pass, class and the like. God be gracious to Baumgarden.<br/><br/>For the dulcimer are rather van fan and the like and grace place &c are of the bassoon.<br/><br/>For beat heat, weep peep &c are of the pipe.<br/><br/>For every word has its marrow in the English tongue for order and for delight.<br/><br/>For the dissyllables such as able table &c are the fiddle rhimes.<br/><br/>For all dissyllables and some trissyllables are fiddle rhimes.<br/><br/>For the relations of words are in pairs first.<br/><br/>For the relations of words are sometimes in oppositions.<br/><br/>For the relations of words are according to their distances from the pair.<br/><br/>For there be twelve cardinal virtues the gifts of the twelve sons of Jacob.<br/><br/>For Reuben is Great. God be gracious to Lord Falmouth.<br/><br/>For Simeon is Valiant. God be gracious to the Duke of Somerset.<br/><br/>For Levi is Pious. God be gracious to the Bishop of London.<br/><br/>For Judah is Good. God be gracious to Lord Granville.<br/><br/>For Dan is Clean -- neat, dextrous, apt, active, compact. God be gracious to Draper.<br/><br/>For Naphtali is sublime -- God be gracious to Chesterfield.<br/><br/>For Gad is Contemplative -- God be gracious to Lord Northampton.<br/><br/>For Ashur is Happy -- God be gracious to George Bowes.<br/><br/>For Issachar is strong -- God be gracious to the Duke of Dorsett.<br/><br/>For Zabulon is Constant -- God be gracious to Lord Bath.<br/><br/>For Joseph is Pleasant -- God be gracious to Lord Bolingbroke.<br/><br/>For Benjamin is Wise -- God be gracious to Honeywood.<br/><br/>For all Foundation is from God depending.<br/><br/>For the two Universities are the Eyes of England.<br/><br/>For Cambridge is the right and the brightest.<br/><br/>For Pembroke Hall was founded more in the Lord than any College in Cambridge.<br/><br/>For mustard is the proper food of birds and men are bound to cultivate it for their use.<br/><br/>For they that study the works of God are peculiarly assisted by his Spirit.<br/><br/>For all the creatures mentiond by Pliny are somewhere or other extant to the glory of God.<br/><br/>For Rye is food rather for fowls than men.<br/><br/>For Rye-bread is not taken with thankfulness.<br/><br/>For the lack of Rye may be supplied by Spelt.<br/><br/>For languages work into one another by their bearings.<br/><br/>For the power of some animal is predominant in every language.<br/><br/>For the power and spirit of a CAT is in the Greek.<br/><br/>For the sound of a cat is in the most useful preposition √™√°√¥' √•√µ√∑√ß√≠ .<br/><br/>For the pleasantry of a cat at pranks is in the language ten thousand times over.<br/><br/>For JACK UPON PRANCK is in the performance of g√•√±√© together or seperate.<br/><br/>For Clapperclaw is in the grappling of the words upon one another in all the modes of versification.<br/><br/>For the sleekness of a Cat is in his √°√£√´√°√©√ß√∂√© .<br/><br/>For the Greek is thrown from heaven and falls upon its feet.<br/><br/>For the Greek when distracted from the line is sooner restored to rank and rallied into some form than any other.<br/><br/>For the purring of a Cat is his √¥√±√µ√¶√•√© .<br/><br/>For his cry is in √Ø√µ√°√© , which I am sorry for.<br/><br/>For the Mouse (Mus) prevails in the Latin.<br/><br/>For Edi-mus, bibi-mus, vivi-mus -- ore-mus.<br/><br/>For the Mouse is a creature of great personal valour.<br/><br/>For -- this is a true case -- Cat takes female mouse from the company of male -- male mouse will not depart, but stands threatning and daring.<br/><br/>For this is as much as to challenge, if you will let her go, I will engage you, as prodigious a creature as you are.<br/><br/>For the Mouse is of an hospitable disposition.<br/><br/>For bravery and hospitality were said and done by the Romans rather than others.<br/><br/>For two creatures the Bull and the Dog prevail in the English.<br/><br/>For all the words ending in ble are in the creature. Invisi-ble, Incomprehensi-ble, ineffa-ble, A-ble.<br/><br/>For the Greek and Latin are not dead languages, but taken up and accepted for the sake of him that spake them.<br/><br/>For can is (canis) is cause and effect a dog.<br/><br/>For the English is concise and strong. Dog and Bull again.<br/><br/>For Newton's notion of colours is √°√´√Ø√£√Ø√≤ unphilosophical.<br/><br/>For the colours are spiritual.<br/><br/>For WHITE is the first and the best.<br/><br/>For there are many intermediate colours, before you come to SILVER.<br/><br/>For the next colour is a lively GREY.<br/><br/>For the next colour is BLUE.<br/><br/>For the next is GREEN of which there are ten thousand distinct sorts.<br/><br/>For the next is YELLOW which is more excellent than red, tho Newton makes red the prime. God be gracious to John Delap.<br/><br/>For RED is the next working round the Orange.<br/><br/>For Red is of sundry sorts till it deepens to BLACK.<br/><br/>For black blooms and it is PURPLE.<br/><br/>For purple works off to BROWN which is of ten thousand acceptable shades.<br/><br/>For the next is PALE. God be gracious to William Whitehead.<br/><br/>For pale works about to White again.<br/><br/>NOW that colour is spiritual appears inasmuch as the blessing of God upon all things descends in colour.<br/><br/>For the blessing of health upon the human face is in colour.<br/><br/>For the blessing of God upon purity is in the Virgin's blushes.<br/><br/>For the blessing of God in colour is on him that keeps his virgin.<br/><br/>For I saw a blush in Staindrop Church, which was of God's own colouring.<br/><br/>For it was the benevolence of a virgin shewn to me before the whole congregation.<br/><br/>For the blessing of God upon the grass is in shades of Green visible to a nice observer as they light upon the surface of the earth.<br/><br/>For the blessing of God unto perfection in all bloom and fruit is by colouring.<br/><br/>For from hence something in the spirit may be taken off by painters.<br/><br/>For Painting is a species of idolatry, tho' not so gross as statuary.<br/><br/>For it is not good to look with earning upon any dead work.<br/><br/>For by so doing something is lost in the spirit and given from life to death.<br/><br/>For BULL in the first place is the word of Almighty God.<br/><br/>For he is a creature of infinite magnitude in the height.<br/><br/>For there is the model of every beast of the field in the height.<br/><br/>For they are blessed intelligences and all angels of the living God.<br/><br/>For there are many words under Bull.<br/><br/>For Bul the Month is under it.<br/><br/>For Sea is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Brook is under Bull. God be gracious to Lord Bolingbroke.<br/><br/>For Rock is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Bullfinch is under Bull. God be gracious to the Duke of Cleveland.<br/><br/>For God, which always keeps his work in view has paited a Bullfinch in the heart of a stone. God be gracious to Gosling and Canterbury.<br/><br/>For the Bluecap is under Bull.<br/><br/>For the Humming Bird is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Beetle is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Toad is under bull.<br/><br/>For Frog is under Bull, which he has a delight to look at.<br/><br/>For the Pheasant-eyed Pink is under Bull. Blessed Jesus R4NK EL.<br/><br/>For Bugloss is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Bugle is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Oxeye is under Bull.<br/><br/>For Fire is under Bull.<br/><br/>For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.<br/><br/>For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.<br/><br/>For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.<br/><br/>For is this done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.<br/><br/>For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.<br/><br/>For he rolls upon prank to work it in.<br/><br/>For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.<br/><br/>For this he performs in ten degrees.<br/><br/>For first he looks upon his fore-paws to see if they are clean.<br/><br/>For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.<br/><br/>For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the fore paws extended.<br/><br/>For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.<br/><br/>For fifthly he washes himself.<br/><br/>For Sixthly he rolls upon wash.<br/><br/>For Seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.<br/><br/>For Eighthly he rubs himself against a post.<br/><br/>For Ninthly he looks up for his instructions.<br/><br/>For Tenthly he goes in quest of food.<br/><br/>For having consider'd God and himself he will consider his neighbour.<br/><br/>For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.<br/><br/>For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it chance.<br/><br/>For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.<br/><br/>For when his day's work is done his business more properly begins.<br/><br/>For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary.<br/><br/>For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.<br/><br/>For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life<br/><br/>For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.<br/><br/>For he is of the tribe of Tiger.<br/><br/>For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.<br/><br/>For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.<br/><br/>For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.<br/><br/>For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he's a good Cat.<br/><br/>For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.<br/><br/>For every house is incompleat without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.<br/><br/>For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.<br/><br/>For every family had one cat at least in the bag.<br/><br/>For the English Cats are the best in Europe.<br/><br/>For he is the cleanest in the use of his fore-paws of any quadrupede.<br/><br/>For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.<br/><br/>For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.<br/><br/>For he is tenacious of his point.<br/><br/>For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.<br/><br/>For he knows that God is his Saviour.<br/><br/>For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.<br/><br/>For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.<br/><br/>For he is of the Lord's poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually -- Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.<br/><br/>For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.<br/><br/>For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in compleat cat.<br/><br/>For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in musick.<br/><br/>For he is docile and can learn certain things.<br/><br/>For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.<br/><br/>For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.<br/><br/>For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.<br/><br/>For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.<br/><br/>For he can jump from an eminence into his master's bosom.<br/><br/>For he can catch the cork and toss it again.<br/><br/>For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.<br/><br/>For the former is affraid of detection.<br/><br/>For the latter refuses the charge.<br/><br/>For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.<br/><br/>For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.<br/><br/>For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.<br/><br/>For he killed the Icneumon-rat very pernicious by land.<br/><br/>For his ears are so acute that they sting again.<br/><br/>For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.<br/><br/>For by stroaking of him I have found out electricity.<br/><br/>For I perceived God's light about him both wax and fire.<br/><br/>For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.<br/><br/>For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.<br/><br/>For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.<br/><br/>For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadrupede.<br/><br/>For he can tread to all the measures upon the musick.<br/><br/>For he can swim for life.<br/><br/>For he can creep.
