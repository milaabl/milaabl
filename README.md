# üíÆ Hyperion by *John Keats*

<p>
    BOOK I<br/><br/>     Deep in the shady sadness of a vale<br/>Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,<br/>Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,<br/>Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,<br/>Still as the silence round about his lair;<br/>Forest on forest hung above his head<br/>Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,<br/>Not so much life as on a summer's day<br/>Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,<br/>But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.<br/>A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more<br/>By reason of his fallen divinity<br/>Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds<br/>Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.<br/><br/>     Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,<br/>No further than to where his feet had stray'd,<br/>And slept there since.  Upon the sodden ground<br/>His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,<br/>Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;<br/>While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,<br/>His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.<br/><br/>     It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;<br/>But there came one, who with a kindred hand<br/>Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low<br/>With reverence, though to one who knew it not.<br/>She was a Goddess of the infant world;<br/>By her in stature the tall Amazon<br/>Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en<br/>Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;<br/>Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.<br/>Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,<br/>Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,<br/>When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.<br/>But oh! how unlike marble was that face:<br/>How beautiful, if sorrow had not made<br/>Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.<br/>There was a listening fear in her regard,<br/>As if calamity had but begun;<br/>As if the vanward clouds of evil days<br/>Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear<br/>Was with its stored thunder labouring up.<br/>One hand she press'd upon that aching spot<br/>Where beats the human heart, as if just there,<br/>Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:<br/>The other upon Saturn's bended neck<br/>She laid, and to the level of his ear<br/>Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake<br/>In solemn tenor and deep organ tone:<br/>Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue<br/>Would come in these like accents; O how frail<br/>To that large utterance of the early Gods!<br/>"Saturn, look up!---though wherefore, poor old King?<br/>I have no comfort for thee, no not one:<br/>I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'<br/>For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth<br/>Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;<br/>And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,<br/>Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air<br/>Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.<br/>Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,<br/>Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;<br/>And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands<br/>Scorches and burns our once serene domain.<br/>O aching time! O moments big as years!<br/>All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,<br/>And press it so upon our weary griefs<br/>That unbelief has not a space to breathe.<br/>Saturn, sleep on:---O thoughtless, why did I<br/>Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?<br/>Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?<br/>Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."<br/><br/>     As when, upon a tranced summer-night,<br/>Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,<br/>Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,<br/>Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,<br/>Save from one gradual solitary gust<br/>Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,<br/>As if the ebbing air had but one wave;<br/>So came these words and went; the while in tears<br/>She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,<br/>Just where her fallen hair might be outspread<br/>A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.<br/>One moon, with alteration slow, had shed<br/>Her silver seasons four upon the night,<br/>And still these two were postured motionless,<br/>Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;<br/>The frozen God still couchant on the earth,<br/>And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:<br/>Until at length old Saturn lifted up<br/>His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,<br/>And all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,<br/>And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,<br/>As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard<br/>Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:<br/>"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,<br/>Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;<br/>Look up, and let me see our doom in it;<br/>Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape<br/>Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice<br/>Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,<br/>Naked and bare of its great diadem,<br/>Peers like the front of Saturn? Who had power<br/>To make me desolate? Whence came the strength?<br/>How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,<br/>While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?<br/>But it is so; and I am smother'd up,<br/>And buried from all godlike exercise<br/>Of influence benign on planets pale,<br/>Of admonitions to the winds and seas,<br/>Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,<br/>And all those acts which Deity supreme<br/>Doth ease its heart of love in.---I am gone<br/>Away from my own bosom: I have left<br/>My strong identity, my real self,<br/>Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit<br/>Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!<br/>Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round<br/>Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;<br/>Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;<br/>Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.---<br/>Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest<br/>A certain shape or shadow, making way<br/>With wings or chariot fierce to repossess<br/>A heaven he lost erewhile: it must---it must<br/>Be of ripe progress---Saturn must be King.<br/>Yes, there must be a golden victory;<br/>There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown<br/>Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival<br/>Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,<br/>Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir<br/>Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be<br/>Beautiful things made new, for the surprise<br/>Of the sky-children; I will give command:<br/>Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"<br/>This passion lifted him upon his feet,<br/>And made his hands to struggle in the air,<br/>His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,<br/>His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.<br/>He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;<br/>A little time, and then again he snatch'd<br/>Utterance thus.---"But cannot I create?<br/>Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth<br/>Another world, another universe,<br/>To overbear and crumble this to nought?<br/>Where is another Chaos? Where?"---That word<br/>Found way unto Olympus, and made quake<br/>The rebel three.---Thea was startled up,<br/>And in her bearing was a sort of hope,<br/>As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.<br/><br/>     "This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,<br/>O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;<br/>I know the covert, for thence came I hither."<br/>Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went<br/>With backward footing through the shade a space:<br/>He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way<br/>Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist<br/>Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.<br/><br/>     Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,<br/>More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,<br/>Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:<br/>The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,<br/>Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,<br/>And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.<br/>But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept<br/>His sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;---<br/>Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire<br/>Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up<br/>From man to the sun's God: yet unsecure:<br/>For as among us mortals omens drear<br/>Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he---<br/>Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,<br/>Or the familiar visiting of one<br/>Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,<br/>Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;<br/>But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,<br/>Oft made Hyperion ache.  His palace bright,<br/>Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,<br/>And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,<br/>Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,<br/>Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;<br/>And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds<br/>Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings,<br/>Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,<br/>Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard<br/>Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.<br/>Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths<br/>Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,<br/>Instead of sweets, his ample palate took<br/>Savor of poisonous brass and metal sick:<br/>And so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,<br/>After the full completion of fair day,---<br/>For rest divine upon exalted couch,<br/>And slumber in the arms of melody,<br/>He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease<br/>With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;<br/>While far within each aisle and deep recess,<br/>His winged minions in close clusters stood,<br/>Amaz'd and full offear; like anxious men<br/>Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,<br/>When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.<br/>Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,<br/>Went step for step with Thea through the woods,<br/>Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,<br/>Came slope upon the threshold of the west;<br/>Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope<br/>In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,<br/>Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet<br/>And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;<br/>And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,<br/>In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,<br/>That inlet to severe magnificence<br/>Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.<br/><br/>     He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;<br/>His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,<br/>And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,<br/>That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours<br/>And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared<br/>From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,<br/>Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,<br/>And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,<br/>Until he reach'd the great main cupola;<br/>There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,<br/>And from the basements deep to the high towers<br/>Jarr'd his own golden region; and before<br/>The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,<br/>His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,<br/>To this result: "O dreams of day and night!<br/>O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!<br/>O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!<br/>O lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!<br/>Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why<br/>Is my eternal essence thus distraught<br/>To see and to behold these horrors new?<br/>Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?<br/>Am I to leave this haven of my rest,<br/>This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,<br/>This calm luxuriance of blissful light,<br/>These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,<br/>Of all my lucent empire?  It is left<br/>Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.<br/>The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,<br/>I cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness.<br/>Even here, into my centre of repose,<br/>The shady visions come to domineer,<br/>Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.---<br/>Fall!---No, by Tellus and her briny robes!<br/>Over the fiery frontier of my realms<br/>I will advance a terrible right arm<br/>Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,<br/>And bid old Saturn take his throne again."---<br/>He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat<br/>Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;<br/>For as in theatres of crowded men<br/>Hubbub increases more they call out "Hush!"<br/>So at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale<br/>Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;<br/>And from the mirror'd level where he stood<br/>A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.<br/>At this, through all his bulk an agony<br/>Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,<br/>Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular<br/>Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd<br/>From over-strained might.  Releas'd, he fled<br/>To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours<br/>Before the dawn in season due should blush,<br/>He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,<br/>Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide<br/>Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.<br/>The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode<br/>Each day from east to west the heavens through,<br/>Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;<br/>Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,<br/>But ever and anon the glancing spheres,<br/>Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,<br/>Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark<br/>Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep<br/>Up to the zenith,---hieroglyphics old,<br/>Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers<br/>Then living on the earth, with laboring thought<br/>Won from the gaze of many centuries:<br/>Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge<br/>Of stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,<br/>Their wisdom long since fled.---Two wings this orb<br/>Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,<br/>Ever exalted at the God's approach:<br/>And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense<br/>Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;<br/>While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,<br/>Awaiting for Hyperion's command.<br/>Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne<br/>And bid the day begin, if but for change.<br/>He might not:---No, though a primeval God:<br/>The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.<br/>Therefore the operations of the dawn<br/>Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.<br/>Those silver wings expanded sisterly,<br/>Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide<br/>Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night<br/>And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,<br/>Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent<br/>His spirit to the sorrow of the time;<br/>And all along a dismal rack of clouds,<br/>Upon the boundaries of day and night,<br/>He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.<br/>There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars<br/>Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice<br/>Of Coelus, from the universal space,<br/>Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear:<br/>"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born<br/>And sky-engendered, son of mysteries<br/>All unrevealed even to the powers<br/>Which met at thy creating; at whose joys<br/>And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,<br/>I, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;<br/>And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,<br/>Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,<br/>Manifestations of that beauteous life<br/>Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:<br/>Of these new-form'd art thou, O brightest child!<br/>Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!<br/>There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion<br/>Of son against his sire.  I saw him fall,<br/>I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!<br/>To me his arms were spread, to me his voice<br/>Found way from forth the thunders round his head!<br/>Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.<br/>Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:<br/>For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.<br/>Divine ye were created, and divine<br/>In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,<br/>Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:<br/>Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;<br/>Actions of rage and passion; even as<br/>I see them, on the mortal world beneath,<br/>In men who die.---This is the grief, O son!<br/>Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!<br/>Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,<br/>As thou canst move about, an evident God;<br/>And canst oppose to each malignant hour<br/>Ethereal presence:---I am but a voice;<br/>My life is but the life of winds and tides,<br/>No more than winds and tides can I avail:---<br/>But thou canst.---Be thou therefore in the van<br/>Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb<br/>Before the tense string murmur.---To the earth!<br/>For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.<br/>Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,<br/>And of thy seasons be a careful nurse."---<br/>Ere half this region-whisper had come down,<br/>Hyperion arose, and on the stars<br/>Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide<br/>Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:<br/>And still they were the same bright, patient stars.<br/>Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,<br/>Like to a diver in the pearly seas,<br/>Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,<br/>And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.<br/><br/><br/>BOOK II<br/><br/>Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings<br/>Hyperion slid into the rustled air,<br/>And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place<br/>Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.<br/>It was a den where no insulting light<br/>Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans<br/>They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar<br/>Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,<br/>Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.<br/>Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd<br/>Ever as if just rising from a sleep,<br/>Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;<br/>And thus in thousand hugest phantasies<br/>Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.<br/>Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,<br/>Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge<br/>Stubborn'd with iron.  All were not assembled:<br/>Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.<br/>Caus, and Gyges, and Briareus,<br/>Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,<br/>With many more, the brawniest in assault,<br/>Were pent in regions of laborious breath;<br/>Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep<br/>Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs<br/>Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;<br/>Without a motion, save of their big hearts<br/>Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd<br/>With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.<br/>Mnemosyne was straying in the world;<br/>Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;<br/>And many else were free to roam abroad,<br/>But for the main, here found they covert drear.<br/>Scarce images of life, one here, one there,<br/>Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque<br/>Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,<br/>When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,<br/>In dull November, and their chancel vault,<br/>The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.<br/>Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave<br/>Or word, or look, or action of despair.<br/>Creus was one; his ponderous iron mace<br/>Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock<br/>Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.<br/>Iapetus another; in his grasp,<br/>A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue<br/>Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length<br/>Dead: and because the creature could not spit<br/>Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.<br/>Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,<br/>As though in pain; for still upon the flint<br/>He ground severe his skull, with open mouth<br/>And eyes at horrid working.  Nearest him<br/>Asia, born of most enormous Caf,<br/>Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,<br/>Though feminine, than any of her sons:<br/>More thought than woe was in her dusky face,<br/>For she was prophesying of her glory;<br/>And in her wide imagination stood<br/>Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes<br/>By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.<br/>Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,<br/>So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk<br/>Shed from the broadest of her elephants.<br/>Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,<br/>Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,<br/>Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild<br/>As grazing ox unworried in the meads;<br/>Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,<br/>He meditated, plotted, and even now<br/>Was hurling mountains in that second war,<br/>Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods<br/>To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.<br/>Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone<br/>Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons.  Neighbour'd close<br/>Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap<br/>Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.<br/>In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet<br/>Of Ops the queen; all clouded round from sight,<br/>No shape distinguishable, more than when<br/>Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:<br/>And many else whose names may not be told.<br/>For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,<br/>Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt<br/>Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd<br/>With damp and slippery footing from a depth<br/>More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff<br/>Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew<br/>Till on the level height their steps found ease:<br/>Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms<br/>Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,<br/>And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:<br/>There saw she direst strife; the supreme God<br/>At war with all the frailty of grief,<br/>Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,<br/>Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.<br/>Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate<br/>Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,<br/>A disanointing poison: so that Thea,<br/>Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass<br/>First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.<br/><br/>     As with us mortal men, the laden heart<br/>Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,<br/>When it is nighing to the mournful house<br/>Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;<br/>So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,<br/>Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,<br/>But that he met Enceladus's eye,<br/>Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once<br/>Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,<br/>"Titans, behold your God!" at which some groan'd;<br/>Some started on their feet; some also shouted;<br/>Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;<br/>And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,<br/>Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,<br/>Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.<br/>There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines<br/>When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise<br/>Among immortals when a God gives sign,<br/>With hushing finger, how he means to load<br/>His tongue with the filll weight of utterless thought,<br/>With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:<br/>Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;<br/>Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,<br/>No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,<br/>Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom<br/>Grew up like organ, that begins anew<br/>Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,<br/>Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.<br/>Thus grew it up---"Not in my own sad breast,<br/>Which is its own great judge and searcher out,<br/>Can I find reason why ye should be thus:<br/>Not in the legends of the first of days,<br/>Studied from that old spirit-leaved book<br/>Which starry Uranus with finger bright<br/>Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves<br/>Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;---<br/>And the which book ye know I ever kept<br/>For my firm-based footstool:---Ah, infirm!<br/>Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent<br/>Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,---<br/>At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling<br/>One against one, or two, or three, or all<br/>Each several one against the other three,<br/>As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods<br/>Drown both, and press them both against earth's face,<br/>Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath<br/>Unhinges the poor world;---not in that strife,<br/>Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,<br/>Can I find reason why ye should be thus:<br/>No, nowhere can unriddle, though I search,<br/>And pore on Nature's universal scroll<br/>Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,<br/>The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,<br/>Should cower beneath what, in comparison,<br/>Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,<br/>O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!<br/>O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'---Ye groan:<br/>Shall I say 'Crouch!'---Ye groan. What can I then?<br/>O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!<br/>What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,<br/>How we can war, how engine our great wrath!<br/>O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear<br/>Is all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,<br/>Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face<br/>I see, astonied, that severe content<br/>Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"<br/><br/>     So ended Saturn; and the God of the sea,<br/>Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,<br/>But cogitation in his watery shades,<br/>Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,<br/>In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue<br/>Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.<br/>"O ye, whom wrath consumes!  who, passion-stung,<br/>Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!<br/>Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,<br/>My voice is not a bellows unto ire.<br/>Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof<br/>How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:<br/>And in the proof much comfort will I give,<br/>If ye will take that comfort in its truth.<br/>We fall by course of Nature's law, not force<br/>Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou<br/>Hast sifted well the atom-universe;<br/>But for this reason, that thou art the King,<br/>And only blind from sheer supremacy,<br/>One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,<br/>Through which I wandered to eternal truth.<br/>And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,<br/>So art thou not the last; it cannot be:<br/>Thou art not the beginning nor the end.<br/>From Chaos and parental Darkness came<br/>Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,<br/>That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends<br/>Was ripening in itself.  The ripe hour came,<br/>And with it Light, and Light, engendering<br/>Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd<br/>The whole enormous matter into life.<br/>Upon that very hour, our parentage,<br/>The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:<br/>Then thou first born, and we the giant race,<br/>Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.<br/>Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;<br/>O folly! for to bear all naked truths,<br/>And to envisage circumstance, all calm,<br/>That is the top of sovereignty.  Mark well!<br/>As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far<br/>Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;<br/>And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth<br/>In form and shape compact and beautiful,<br/>In will, in action free, companionship,<br/>And thousand other signs of purer life;<br/>So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,<br/>A power more strong in beauty, born of us<br/>And fated to excel us, as we pass<br/>In glory that old Darkness: nor are we<br/>Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule<br/>Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil<br/>Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,<br/>And feedeth still, more comely than itself?<br/>Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?<br/>Or shall the tree be envious of the dove<br/>Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings<br/>To wander wherewithal and find its joys?<br/>We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs<br/>Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,<br/>But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower<br/>Above us in their beauty, and must reign<br/>In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law<br/>That first in beauty should be first in might:<br/>Yea, by that law, another race may drive<br/>Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.<br/>Have ye beheld the young God of the seas,<br/>My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?<br/>Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along<br/>By noble winged creatures he hath made?<br/>I saw him on the calmed waters scud,<br/>With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,<br/>That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell<br/>To all my empire: farewell sad I took,<br/>And hither came, to see how dolorous fate<br/>Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best<br/>Give consolation in this woe extreme.<br/>Receive the truth, and let it be your balm."<br/><br/>     Whether through pos'd conviction, or disdain,<br/>They guarded silence, when Oceanus<br/>Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?<br/>But so it was, none answer'd for a space,<br/>Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;<br/>And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,<br/>With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,<br/>Thus wording timidly among the fierce:<br/>"O Father! I am here the simplest voice,<br/>And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,<br/>And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,<br/>There to remain for ever, as I fear:<br/>I would not bode of evil, if I thought<br/>So weak a creature could turn off the help<br/>Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;<br/>Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell<br/>Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,<br/>And know that we had parted from all hope.<br/>I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,<br/>Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land<br/>Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.<br/>Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;<br/>Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;<br/>So that I felt a movement in my heart<br/>To chide, and to reproach that solitude<br/>With songs of misery, music of our woes;<br/>And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell<br/>And murmur'd into it, and made melody---<br/>O melody no more! for while I sang,<br/>And with poor skill let pass into the breeze<br/>The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand<br/>Just opposite, an island of the sea,<br/>There came enchantment with the shifting wind,<br/>That did both drown and keep alive my ears.<br/>I threw my shell away upon the sand,<br/>And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd<br/>With that new blissful golden melody.<br/>A living death was in each gush of sounds,<br/>Each family of rapturous hurried notes,<br/>That fell, one after one, yet all at once,<br/>Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:<br/>And then another, then another strain,<br/>Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,<br/>With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,<br/>To hover round my head, and make me sick<br/>Of joy and grief at once.  Grief overcame,<br/>And I was stopping up my frantic ears,<br/>When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,<br/>A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,<br/>And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!<br/>The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'<br/>I fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!'<br/>O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt<br/>Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,<br/>Ye would not call this too indulged tongue<br/>Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard."<br/><br/>     So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook<br/>That, lingering along a pebbled coast,<br/>Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,<br/>And shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice<br/>Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:<br/>The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves<br/>In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,<br/>Came booming thus, while still upon his arm<br/>He lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.<br/>"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,<br/>Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?<br/>Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all<br/>That rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent,<br/>Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,<br/>Could agonize me more than baby-words<br/>In midst of this dethronement horrible.<br/>Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.<br/>Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?<br/>Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?<br/>Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the waves,<br/>Thy scalding in the seas?  What! have I rous'd<br/>Your spleens with so few simple words as these?<br/>O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:<br/>O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes<br/>Wide-glaring for revenge!"---As this he said,<br/>He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,<br/>Still without intermission speaking thus:<br/>"Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,<br/>And purge the ether of our enemies;<br/>How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,<br/>And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,<br/>Stifling that puny essence in its tent.<br/>O let him feel the evil he hath done;<br/>For though I scorn Oceanus's lore,<br/>Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:<br/>The days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;<br/>Those days, all innocent of scathing war,<br/>When all the fair Existences of heaven<br/>Carne open-eyed to guess what we would speak:---<br/>That was before our brows were taught to frown,<br/>Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;<br/>That was before we knew the winged thing,<br/>Victory, might be lost, or might be won.<br/>And be ye mindful that Hyperion,<br/>Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced---<br/>Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!"<br/><br/>     All eyes were on Enceladus's face,<br/>And they beheld, while still Hyperion's name<br/>Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,<br/>A pallid gleam across his features stern:<br/>Not savage, for he saw full many a God<br/>Wroth as himself.  He look'd upon them all,<br/>And in each face he saw a gleam of light,<br/>But splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks<br/>Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel<br/>When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.<br/>In pale and silver silence they remain'd,<br/>Till suddenly a splendor, like the morn,<br/>Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,<br/>All the sad spaces of oblivion,<br/>And every gulf, and every chasm old,<br/>And every height, and every sullen depth,<br/>Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:<br/>And all the everlasting cataracts,<br/>And all the headlong torrents far and near,<br/>Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,<br/>Now saw the light and made it terrible.<br/>It was Hyperion:---a granite peak<br/>His bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view<br/>The misery his brilliance had betray'd<br/>To the most hateful seeing of itself.<br/>Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,<br/>Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade<br/>In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk<br/>Of Memnon's image at the set of sun<br/>To one who travels from the dusking East:<br/>Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon's harp<br/>He utter'd, while his hands contemplative<br/>He press'd together, and in silence stood.<br/>Despondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods<br/>At sight of the dejected King of day,<br/>And many hid their faces from the light:<br/>But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes<br/>Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,<br/>Uprose Iapetus, and Creus too,<br/>And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode<br/>To where he towered on his eminence.<br/>There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name;<br/>Hyperion from the peak loud answered, "Saturn!"<br/>Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,<br/>In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods<br/>Gave from their hollow throats the name of "Saturn!"<br/><br/><br/>BOOK III<br/><br/>Thus in altemate uproar and sad peace,<br/>Amazed were those Titans utterly.<br/>O leave them, Muse!  O leave them to their woes;<br/>For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:<br/>A solitary sorrow best befits<br/>Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.<br/>Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find<br/>Many a fallen old Divinity<br/>Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.<br/>Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,<br/>And not a wind of heaven but will breathe<br/>In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;<br/>For lo! 'tis for the Father of all verse.<br/>Flush everything that hath a vermeil hue,<br/>Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,<br/>And let the clouds of even and of morn<br/>Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills;<br/>Let the red wine within the goblet boil,<br/>Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells,<br/>On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn<br/>Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid<br/>Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.<br/>Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,<br/>Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,<br/>And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,<br/>In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,<br/>And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:<br/>Apollo is once more the golden theme!<br/>Where was he, when the Giant of the sun<br/>Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?<br/>Together had he left his mother fair<br/>And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,<br/>And in the morning twilight wandered forth<br/>Beside the osiers of a rivulet,<br/>Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.<br/>The nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars<br/>Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush<br/>Began calm-throated.  Throughout all the isle<br/>There was no covert, no retired cave,<br/>Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,<br/>Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.<br/>He listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears<br/>Went trickling down the golden bow he held.<br/>Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,<br/>While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by<br/>With solemn step an awful Goddess came,<br/>And there was purport in her looks for him,<br/>Which he with eager guess began to read<br/>Perplex'd, the while melodiously he said:<br/>"How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?<br/>Or hath that antique mien and robed form<br/>Mov'd in these vales invisible till now?<br/>Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er<br/>The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone<br/>In cool mid-forest.  Surely I have traced<br/>The rustle of those ample skirts about<br/>These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers<br/>Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.<br/>Goddess! I have beheld those eyes before,<br/>And their eternal calm, and all that face,<br/>Or I have dream'd."---"Yes," said the supreme shape,<br/>"Thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up<br/>Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,<br/>Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast<br/>Unwearied ear of the whole universe<br/>Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth<br/>Of such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange<br/>That thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,<br/>What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad<br/>When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs<br/>To one who in this lonely isle hath been<br/>The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,<br/>From the young day when first thy infant hand<br/>Pluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm<br/>Could bend that bow heroic to all times.<br/>Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power<br/>Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones<br/>For prophecies of thee, and for the sake<br/>Of loveliness new born."---Apollo then,<br/>With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,<br/>Thus answer'd, while his white melodious throat<br/>Throbb'd with the syllables.---"Mnemosyne!<br/>Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how;<br/>Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?<br/>Why should I strive to show what from thy lips<br/>Would come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,<br/>And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:<br/>I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,<br/>Until a melancholy numbs my limbs;<br/>And then upon the grass I sit, and moan,<br/>Like one who once had wings.---O why should I<br/>Feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air<br/>Yields to my step aspirant? why should I<br/>Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?<br/>Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:<br/>Are there not other regions than this isle?<br/>What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!<br/>And the most patient brilliance of the moon!<br/>And stars by thousands!  Point me out the way<br/>To any one particular beauteous star,<br/>And I will flit into it with my lyre,<br/>And make its silvery splendor pant with bliss.<br/>I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?<br/>Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity<br/>Makes this alarum in the elements,<br/>While I here idle listen on the shores<br/>In fearless yet in aching ignorance?<br/>O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,<br/>That waileth every morn and eventide,<br/>Tell me why thus I rave about these groves!<br/>Mute thou remainest---Mute! yet I can read<br/>A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:<br/>Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.<br/>Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,<br/>Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,<br/>Creations and destroyings, all at once<br/>Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,<br/>And deify me, as if some blithe wine<br/>Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,<br/>And so become immortal."---Thus the God,<br/>While his enkindled eyes, with level glance<br/>Beneath his white soft temples, steadfast kept<br/>Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.<br/>Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush<br/>All the immortal fairness of his limbs;<br/>Most like the struggle at the gate of death;<br/>Or liker still to one who should take leave<br/>Of pale immortal death, and with a pang<br/>As hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse<br/>Die into life: so young Apollo anguish'd:<br/>His very hair, his golden tresses famed,<br/>Kept undulation round his eager neck.<br/>During the pain Mnemosyne upheld<br/>Her arms as one who prophesied. At length<br/>Apollo shriek'd;---and lo! from all his limbs<br/>Celestial.
