  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Song for the Luddites by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    AS the Liberty lads o'er the sea<br/>Bought their freedom, and cheaply, with blood,<br/>      So we, boys, we<br/>  Will _die_ fighting, or _live_ free,<br/>And down with all kings but King Ludd!<br/><br/>When the web that we weave is complete,<br/>And the shuttle exchanged for the sword,<br/>  We will fling the winding sheet<br/>  O'er the despot at our feet,<br/>And dye it deep in the gore he has poured.<br/><br/>Though black as his heart its hue,<br/>Since his veins are corrupted to mud,<br/>        Yet this is the dew<br/>        Which the tree shall renew<br/>Of Liberty, planted by Ludd!
</p>
