# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 09 by *John Milton*

<p>
    No more of talk where God or Angel guest<br/>With Man, as with his friend, familiar us'd,<br/>To sit indulgent, and with him partake<br/>Rural repast; permitting him the while<br/>Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change<br/>Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach<br/>Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,<br/>And disobedience: on the part of Heaven<br/>Now alienated, distance and distaste,<br/>Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,<br/>That brought into this world a world of woe,<br/>Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery<br/>Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument<br/>Not less but more heroick than the wrath<br/>Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued<br/>Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage<br/>Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd;<br/>Or Neptune's ire, or Juno's, that so long<br/>Perplexed the Greek, and Cytherea's son:<br/><br/>If answerable style I can obtain<br/>Of my celestial patroness, who deigns<br/>Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,<br/>And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires<br/>Easy my unpremeditated verse:<br/>Since first this subject for heroick song<br/>Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;<br/>Not sedulous by nature to indite<br/>Wars, hitherto the only argument<br/>Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect<br/>With long and tedious havock fabled knights<br/>In battles feign'd; the better fortitude<br/>Of patience and heroick martyrdom<br/>Unsung; or to describe races and games,<br/>Or tilting furniture, imblazon'd shields,<br/>Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,<br/>Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights<br/>At joust and tournament; then marshall'd feast<br/>Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals;<br/>The skill of artifice or office mean,<br/>Not that which justly gives heroick name<br/>To person, or to poem.  Me, of these<br/>Nor skill'd nor studious, higher argument<br/>Remains; sufficient of itself to raise<br/>That name, unless an age too late, or cold<br/>Climate, or years, damp my intended wing<br/>Depress'd; and much they may, if all be mine,<br/>Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.<br/>The sun was sunk, and after him the star<br/>Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring<br/>Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter<br/>"twixt day and night, and now from end to end<br/>Night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round:<br/>When satan, who late fled before the threats<br/>Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd<br/>In meditated fraud and malice, bent<br/>On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap<br/>Of heavier on himself, fearless returned<br/>From compassing the earth; cautious of day,<br/>Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried<br/>His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim<br/>That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,<br/>The space of seven continued nights he rode<br/>With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line<br/>He circled; four times crossed the car of night<br/>From pole to pole, traversing each colure;<br/>On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse<br/>From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth<br/>Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,<br/>Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change,<br/>Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,<br/>Into a gulf shot under ground, till part<br/>Rose up a fountain by the tree of life:<br/>In with the river sunk, and with it rose<br/>Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought<br/>Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land,<br/>From Eden over Pontus and the pool<br/>Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;<br/>Downward as far antarctick; and in length,<br/>West from Orontes to the ocean barred<br/>At Darien ; thence to the land where flows<br/>Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed<br/>With narrow search; and with inspection deep<br/>Considered every creature, which of all<br/>Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found<br/>The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.<br/>Him after long debate, irresolute<br/>Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose<br/>Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom<br/>To enter, and his dark suggestions hide<br/>From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake<br/>Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,<br/>As from his wit and native subtlety<br/>Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed,<br/>Doubt might beget of diabolick power<br/>Active within, beyond the sense of brute.<br/>Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief<br/>His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.<br/>More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built<br/>With second thoughts, reforming what was old!<br/>O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred<br/>For what God, after better, worse would build?<br/>Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens<br/>That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,<br/>Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,<br/>In thee concentring all their precious beams<br/>Of sacred influence!  As God in Heaven<br/>Is center, yet extends to all; so thou,<br/>Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee,<br/>Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears<br/>Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth<br/>Of creatures animate with gradual life<br/>Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.<br/>With what delight could I have walked thee round,<br/>If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange<br/>Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,<br/>Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,<br/>Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these<br/>Find place or refuge; and the more I see<br/>Pleasures about me, so much more I feel<br/>Torment within me, as from the hateful siege<br/>Of contraries: all good to me becomes<br/>Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.<br/>But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven<br/>To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme;<br/>Nor hope to be myself less miserable<br/>By what I seek, but others to make such<br/>As I, though thereby worse to me redound:<br/>For only in destroying I find ease<br/>To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,<br/>Or won to what may work his utter loss,<br/>For whom all this was made, all this will soon<br/>Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe;<br/>In woe then; that destruction wide may range:<br/>To me shall be the glory sole among<br/>The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred<br/>What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days<br/>Continued making; and who knows how long<br/>Before had been contriving? though perhaps<br/>Not longer than since I, in one night, freed<br/>From servitude inglorious well nigh half<br/>The angelick name, and thinner left the throng<br/>Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,<br/>And to repair his numbers thus impaired,<br/>Whether such virtue spent of old now failed<br/>More Angels to create, if they at least<br/>Are his created, or, to spite us more,<br/>Determined to advance into our room<br/>A creature formed of earth, and him endow,<br/>Exalted from so base original,<br/>With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,<br/>He effected; Man he made, and for him built<br/>Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,<br/>Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!<br/>Subjected to his service angel-wings,<br/>And flaming ministers to watch and tend<br/>Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance<br/>I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist<br/>Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry<br/>In every bush and brake, where hap may find<br/>The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds<br/>To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.<br/>O foul descent! that I, who erst contended<br/>With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained<br/>Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,<br/>This essence to incarnate and imbrute,<br/>That to the highth of Deity aspired!<br/>But what will not ambition and revenge<br/>Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low<br/>As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,<br/>To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,<br/>Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:<br/>Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,<br/>Since higher I fall short, on him who next<br/>Provokes my envy, this new favourite<br/>Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,<br/>Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised<br/>From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.<br/>So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,<br/>Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on<br/>His midnight-search, where soonest he might find<br/>The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found<br/>In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,<br/>His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:<br/>Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,<br/>Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,<br/>Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth<br/>The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,<br/>In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired<br/>With act intelligential; but his sleep<br/>Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.<br/>Now, when as sacred light began to dawn<br/>In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed<br/>Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,<br/>From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise<br/>To the Creator, and his nostrils fill<br/>With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,<br/>And joined their vocal worship to the quire<br/>Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake<br/>The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:<br/>Then commune, how that day they best may ply<br/>Their growing work: for much their work out-grew<br/>The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide,<br/>And Eve first to her husband thus began.<br/>Adam, well may we labour still to dress<br/>This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,<br/>Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands<br/>Aid us, the work under our labour grows,<br/>Luxurious by restraint; what we by day<br/>Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,<br/>One night or two with wanton growth derides<br/>Tending to wild.  Thou therefore now advise,<br/>Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present:<br/>Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice<br/>Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind<br/>The woodbine round this arbour, or direct<br/>The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,<br/>In yonder spring of roses intermixed<br/>With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:<br/>For, while so near each other thus all day<br/>Our task we choose, what wonder if so near<br/>Looks intervene and smiles, or object new<br/>Casual discourse draw on; which intermits<br/>Our day's work, brought to little, though begun<br/>Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?<br/>To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.<br/>Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond<br/>Compare above all living creatures dear!<br/>Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,<br/>How we might best fulfil the work which here<br/>God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass<br/>Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found<br/>In woman, than to study houshold good,<br/>And good works in her husband to promote.<br/>Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed<br/>Labour, as to debar us when we need<br/>Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,<br/>Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse<br/>Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,<br/>To brute denied, and are of love the food;<br/>Love, not the lowest end of human life.<br/>For not to irksome toil, but to delight,<br/>He made us, and delight to reason joined.<br/>These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands<br/>Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide<br/>As we need walk, till younger hands ere long<br/>Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps<br/>Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:<br/>For solitude sometimes is best society,<br/>And short retirement urges sweet return.<br/>But other doubt possesses me, lest harm<br/>Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest<br/>What hath been warned us, what malicious foe<br/>Envying our happiness, and of his own<br/>Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame<br/>By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand<br/>Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find<br/>His wish and best advantage, us asunder;<br/>Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each<br/>To other speedy aid might lend at need:<br/>Whether his first design be to withdraw<br/>Our fealty from God, or to disturb<br/>Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss<br/>Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;<br/>Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side<br/>That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.<br/>The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,<br/>Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,<br/>Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.<br/>To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,<br/>As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,<br/>With sweet austere composure thus replied.<br/>Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord!<br/>That such an enemy we have, who seeks<br/>Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,<br/>And from the parting Angel over-heard,<br/>As in a shady nook I stood behind,<br/>Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.<br/>But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt<br/>To God or thee, because we have a foe<br/>May tempt it, I expected not to hear.<br/>His violence thou fearest not, being such<br/>As we, not capable of death or pain,<br/>Can either not receive, or can repel.<br/>His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers<br/>Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love<br/>Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;<br/>Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,<br/>Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?<br/>To whom with healing words Adam replied.<br/>Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!<br/>For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:<br/>Not diffident of thee do I dissuade<br/>Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid<br/>The attempt itself, intended by our foe.<br/>For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses<br/>The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed<br/>Not incorruptible of faith, not proof<br/>Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn<br/>And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,<br/>Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,<br/>If such affront I labour to avert<br/>From thee alone, which on us both at once<br/>The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;<br/>Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.<br/>Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;<br/>Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce<br/>Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid.<br/>I, from the influence of thy looks, receive<br/>Access in every virtue; in thy sight<br/>More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were<br/>Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,<br/>Shame to be overcome or over-reached,<br/>Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.<br/>Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel<br/>When I am present, and thy trial choose<br/>With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?<br/>So spake domestick Adam in his care<br/>And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought<br/>Less attributed to her faith sincere,<br/>Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.<br/>If this be our condition, thus to dwell<br/>In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,<br/>Subtle or violent, we not endued<br/>Single with like defence, wherever met;<br/>How are we happy, still in fear of harm?<br/>But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,<br/>Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem<br/>Of our integrity: his foul esteem<br/>Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns<br/>Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared<br/>By us? who rather double honour gain<br/>From his surmise proved false; find peace within,<br/>Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.<br/>And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed<br/>Alone, without exteriour help sustained?<br/>Let us not then suspect our happy state<br/>Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,<br/>As not secure to single or combined.<br/>Frail is our happiness, if this be so,<br/>And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.<br/>To whom thus Adam fervently replied.<br/>O Woman, best are all things as the will<br/>Of God ordained them: His creating hand<br/>Nothing imperfect or deficient left<br/>Of all that he created, much less Man,<br/>Or aught that might his happy state secure,<br/>Secure from outward force; within himself<br/>The danger lies, yet lies within his power:<br/>Against his will he can receive no harm.<br/>But God left free the will; for what obeys<br/>Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,<br/>But bid her well be ware, and still erect;<br/>Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,<br/>She dictate false; and mis-inform the will<br/>To do what God expressly hath forbid.<br/>Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,<br/>That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.<br/>Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;<br/>Since Reason not impossibly may meet<br/>Some specious object by the foe suborned,<br/>And fall into deception unaware,<br/>Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.<br/>Seek not temptation then, which to avoid<br/>Were better, and most likely if from me<br/>Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.<br/>Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve<br/>First thy obedience; the other who can know,<br/>Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?<br/>But, if thou think, trial unsought may find<br/>Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,<br/>Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;<br/>Go in thy native innocence, rely<br/>On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!<br/>For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.<br/>So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve<br/>Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.<br/>With thy permission then, and thus forewarned<br/>Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words<br/>Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,<br/>May find us both perhaps far less prepared,<br/>The willinger I go, nor much expect<br/>A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;<br/>So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.<br/>Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand<br/>Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,<br/>Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train,<br/>Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self<br/>In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,<br/>Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,<br/>But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,<br/>Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.<br/>To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,<br/>Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled<br/>Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,<br/>Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.<br/>Her long with ardent look his eye pursued<br/>Delighted, but desiring more her stay.<br/>Oft he to her his charge of quick return<br/>Repeated; she to him as oft engaged<br/>To be returned by noon amid the bower,<br/>And all things in best order to invite<br/>Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose.<br/>O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,<br/>Of thy presumed return! event perverse!<br/>Thou never from that hour in Paradise<br/>Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;<br/>Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,<br/>Waited with hellish rancour imminent<br/>To intercept thy way, or send thee back<br/>Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!<br/>For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,<br/>Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;<br/>And on his quest, where likeliest he might find<br/>The only two of mankind, but in them<br/>The whole included race, his purposed prey.<br/>In bower and field he sought, where any tuft<br/>Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,<br/>Their tendance, or plantation for delight;<br/>By fountain or by shady rivulet<br/>He sought them both, but wished his hap might find<br/>Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope<br/>Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,<br/>Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,<br/>Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,<br/>Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round<br/>About her glowed, oft stooping to support<br/>Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay<br/>Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,<br/>Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays<br/>Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while<br/>Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,<br/>From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.<br/>Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed<br/>Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;<br/>Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,<br/>Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers<br/>Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:<br/>Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned<br/>Or of revived Adonis, or renowned<br/>Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son;<br/>Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king<br/>Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.<br/>Much he the place admired, the person more.<br/>As one who long in populous city pent,<br/>Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,<br/>Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe<br/>Among the pleasant villages and farms<br/>Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;<br/>The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,<br/>Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;<br/>If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,<br/>What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;<br/>She most, and in her look sums all delight:<br/>Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold<br/>This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve<br/>Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form<br/>Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,<br/>Her graceful innocence, her every air<br/>Of gesture, or least action, overawed<br/>His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved<br/>His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:<br/>That space the Evil-one abstracted stood<br/>From his own evil, and for the time remained<br/>Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,<br/>Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:<br/>But the hot Hell that always in him burns,<br/>Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,<br/>And tortures him now more, the more he sees<br/>Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon<br/>Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts<br/>Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.<br/>Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet<br/>Compulsion thus transported, to forget<br/>What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope<br/>Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste<br/>Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,<br/>Save what is in destroying; other joy<br/>To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass<br/>Occasion which now smiles; behold alone<br/>The woman, opportune to all attempts,<br/>Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,<br/>Whose higher intellectual more I shun,<br/>And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb<br/>Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;<br/>Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,<br/>I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain<br/>Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.<br/>She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!<br/>Not terrible, though terrour be in love<br/>And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,<br/>Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;<br/>The way which to her ruin now I tend.<br/>So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed<br/>In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve<br/>Addressed his way: not with indented wave,<br/>Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,<br/>Circular base of rising folds, that towered<br/>Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head<br/>Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;<br/>With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect<br/>Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass<br/>Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape<br/>And lovely; never since of serpent-kind<br/>Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,<br/>Hermione and Cadmus, or the god<br/>In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed<br/>Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;<br/>He with Olympias; this with her who bore<br/>Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique<br/>At first, as one who sought access, but feared<br/>To interrupt, side-long he works his way.<br/>As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought<br/>Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind<br/>Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:<br/>So varied he, and of his tortuous train<br/>Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,<br/>To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound<br/>Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used<br/>To such disport before her through the field,<br/>From every beast; more duteous at her call,<br/>Than at Circean call the herd disguised.<br/>He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,<br/>But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed<br/>His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,<br/>Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.<br/>His gentle dumb expression turned at length<br/>The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad<br/>Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue<br/>Organick, or impulse of vocal air,<br/>His fraudulent temptation thus began.<br/>Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps<br/>Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm<br/>Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,<br/>Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze<br/>Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared<br/>Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.<br/>Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,<br/>Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine<br/>By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore<br/>With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,<br/>Where universally admired; but here<br/>In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,<br/>Beholders rude, and shallow to discern<br/>Half what in thee is fair, one man except,<br/>Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen<br/>A Goddess among Gods, adored and served<br/>By Angels numberless, thy daily train.<br/>So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:<br/>Into the heart of Eve his words made way,<br/>Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,<br/>Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.<br/>What may this mean? language of man pronounced<br/>By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?<br/>The first, at least, of these I thought denied<br/>To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,<br/>Created mute to all articulate sound:<br/>The latter I demur; for in their looks<br/>Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.<br/>Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field<br/>I knew, but not with human voice endued;<br/>Redouble then this miracle, and say,<br/>How camest thou speakable of mute, and how<br/>To me so friendly grown above the rest<br/>Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?<br/>Say, for such wonder claims attention due.<br/>To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.<br/>Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!<br/>Easy to me it is to tell thee all<br/>What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:<br/>I was at first as other beasts that graze<br/>The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,<br/>As was my food; nor aught but food discerned<br/>Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:<br/>Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced<br/>A goodly tree far distant to behold<br/>Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,<br/>Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;<br/>When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,<br/>Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense<br/>Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats<br/>Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,<br/>Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.<br/>To satisfy the sharp desire I had<br/>Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved<br/>Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,<br/>Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent<br/>Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.<br/>About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;<br/>For, high from ground, the branches would require<br/>Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree<br/>All other beasts that saw, with like desire<br/>Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.<br/>Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung<br/>Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill<br/>I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,<br/>At feed or fountain, never had I found.<br/>Sated at length, ere long I might perceive<br/>Strange alteration in me, to degree<br/>Of reason in my inward powers; and speech<br/>Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.<br/>Thenceforth to speculations high or deep<br/>I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind<br/>Considered all things visible in Heaven,<br/>Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:<br/>But all that fair and good in thy divine<br/>Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray,<br/>United I beheld; no fair to thine<br/>Equivalent or second! which compelled<br/>Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come<br/>And gaze, and worship thee of right declared<br/>Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!<br/>So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,<br/>Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.<br/>Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt<br/>The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:<br/>But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?<br/>For many are the trees of God that grow<br/>In Paradise, and various, yet unknown<br/>To us; in such abundance lies our choice,<br/>As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,<br/>Still hanging incorruptible, till men<br/>Grow up to their provision, and more hands<br/>Help to disburden Nature of her birth.<br/>To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.<br/>Empress, the way is ready, and not long;<br/>Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,<br/>Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past<br/>Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept<br/>My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon<br/>Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled<br/>In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,<br/>To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy<br/>Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,<br/>Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night<br/>Condenses, and the cold environs round,<br/>Kindled through agitation to a flame,<br/>Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,<br/>Hovering and blazing with delusive light,<br/>Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way<br/>To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;<br/>There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.<br/>So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud<br/>Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree<br/>Of prohibition, root of all our woe;<br/>Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.<br/>Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,<br/>Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,<br/>The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;<br/>Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.<br/>But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;<br/>God so commanded, and left that command<br/>Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live<br/>Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.<br/>To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.<br/>Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit<br/>Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,<br/>Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air$?<br/>To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.  Of the fruit<br/>Of each tree in the garden we may eat;<br/>But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst<br/>The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat<br/>Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<br/>She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold<br/>The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love<br/>To Man, and indignation at his wrong,<br/>New part puts on; and, as to passion moved,<br/>Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act<br/>Raised, as of some great matter to begin.<br/>As when of old some orator renowned,<br/>In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence<br/>Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,<br/>Stood in himself collected; while each part,<br/>Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;<br/>Sometimes in highth began, as no delay<br/>Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:<br/>So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,<br/>The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.<br/>O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,<br/>Mother of science! now I feel thy power<br/>Within me clear; not only to discern<br/>Things in their causes, but to trace the ways<br/>Of highest agents, deemed however wise.<br/>Queen of this universe! do not believe<br/>Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:<br/>How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life<br/>To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,<br/>Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,<br/>And life more perfect have attained than Fate<br/>Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.<br/>Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast<br/>Is open? or will God incense his ire<br/>For such a petty trespass? and not praise<br/>Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain<br/>Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,<br/>Deterred not from achieving what might lead<br/>To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;<br/>Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil<br/>Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?<br/>God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;<br/>Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:<br/>Your fear itself of death removes the fear.<br/>Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe;<br/>Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,<br/>His worshippers?  He knows that in the day<br/>Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,<br/>Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then<br/>Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,<br/>Knowing both good and evil, as they know.<br/>That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,<br/>Internal Man, is but proportion meet;<br/>I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.<br/>So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off<br/>Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,<br/>Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.<br/>And what are Gods, that Man may not become<br/>As they, participating God-like food?<br/>The Gods are first, and that advantage use<br/>On our belief, that all from them proceeds:<br/>I question it; for this fair earth I see,<br/>Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;<br/>Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed<br/>Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,<br/>That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains<br/>Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies<br/>The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?<br/>What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree<br/>Impart against his will, if all be his?<br/>Or is it envy? and can envy dwell<br/>In heavenly breasts?  These, these, and many more<br/>Causes import your need of this fair fruit.<br/>Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!<br/>He ended; and his words, replete with guile,<br/>Into her heart too easy entrance won:<br/>Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold<br/>Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound<br/>Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned<br/>With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:<br/>Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked<br/>An eager appetite, raised by the smell<br/>So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,<br/>Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,<br/>Solicited her longing eye; yet first<br/>Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.<br/>Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,<br/>Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;<br/>Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay<br/>Gave elocution to the mute, and taught<br/>The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:<br/>Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,<br/>Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree<br/>Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;<br/>Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding<br/>Commends thee more, while it infers the good<br/>By thee communicated, and our want:<br/>For good unknown sure is not had; or, had<br/>And yet unknown, is as not had at all.<br/>In plain then, what forbids he but to know,<br/>Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?<br/>Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death<br/>Bind us with after-bands, what profits then<br/>Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat<br/>Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!<br/>How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,<br/>And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,<br/>Irrational till then.  For us alone<br/>Was death invented? or to us denied<br/>This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?<br/>For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first<br/>Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy<br/>The good befallen him, author unsuspect,<br/>Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.<br/>What fear I then? rather, what know to fear<br/>Under this ignorance of good and evil,<br/>Of God or death, of law or penalty?<br/>Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,<br/>Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,<br/>Of virtue to make wise:  What hinders then<br/>To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?<br/>So saying, her rash hand in evil hour<br/>Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!<br/>Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,<br/>Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,<br/>That all was lost.  Back to the thicket slunk<br/>The guilty Serpent; and well might;for Eve,<br/>Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else<br/>Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,<br/>In fruit she never tasted, whether true<br/>Or fancied so, through expectation high<br/>Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.<br/>Greedily she ingorged without restraint,<br/>And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length,<br/>And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,<br/>Thus to herself she pleasingly began.<br/>O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees<br/>In Paradise! of operation blest<br/>To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.<br/>And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end<br/>Created; but henceforth my early care,<br/>Not without song, each morning, and due praise,<br/>Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease<br/>Of thy full branches offered free to all;<br/>Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature<br/>In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;<br/>Though others envy what they cannot give:<br/>For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here<br/>Thus grown.  Experience, next, to thee I owe,<br/>Best guide; not following thee, I had remained<br/>In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way,<br/>And givest access, though secret she retire.<br/>And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,<br/>High, and remote to see from thence distinct<br/>Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps<br/>May have diverted from continual watch<br/>Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies<br/>About him.  But to Adam in what sort<br/>Shall I appear? shall I to him make known<br/>As yet my change, and give him to partake<br/>Full happiness with me, or rather not,<br/>But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power<br/>Without copartner? so to add what wants<br/>In female sex, the more to draw his love,<br/>And render me more equal; and perhaps,<br/>A thing not undesirable, sometime<br/>Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free<br/>This may be well:  But what if God have seen,<br/>And death ensue? then I shall be no more!<br/>And Adam, wedded to another Eve,<br/>Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;<br/>A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve,<br/>Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:<br/>So dear I love him, that with him all deaths<br/>I could endure, without him live no life.<br/>So saying, from the tree her step she turned;<br/>But first low reverence done, as to the Power<br/>That dwelt within, whose presence had infused<br/>Into the plant sciential sap, derived<br/>From nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while,<br/>Waiting desirous her return, had wove<br/>Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn<br/>Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;<br/>As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.<br/>Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new<br/>Solace in her return, so long delayed:<br/>Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,<br/>Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;<br/>And forth to meet her went, the way she took<br/>That morn when first they parted: by the tree<br/>Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,<br/>Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand<br/>A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,<br/>New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.<br/>To him she hasted; in her face excuse<br/>Came prologue, and apology too prompt;<br/>Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.<br/>Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?<br/>Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived<br/>Thy presence; agony of love till now<br/>Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more<br/>Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,<br/>The pain of absence from thy sight.  But strange<br/>Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:<br/>This tree is not, as we are told, a tree<br/>Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown<br/>Opening the way, but of divine effect<br/>To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;<br/>And hath been tasted such:  The serpent wise,<br/>Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,<br/>Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,<br/>Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth<br/>Endued with human voice and human sense,<br/>Reasoning to admiration; and with me<br/>Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I<br/>Have also tasted, and have also found<br/>The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,<br/>Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,<br/>And growing up to Godhead; which for thee<br/>Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.<br/>For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;<br/>Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.<br/>Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot<br/>May join us, equal joy, as equal love;<br/>Lest, thou not tasting, different degree<br/>Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce<br/>Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.<br/>Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;<br/>But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.<br/>On the other side Adam, soon as he heard<br/>The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,<br/>Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill<br/>Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;<br/>From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve<br/>Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:<br/>Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length<br/>First to himself he inward silence broke.<br/>O fairest of Creation, last and best<br/>Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled<br/>Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,<br/>Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!<br/>How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,<br/>Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!<br/>Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress<br/>The strict forbiddance, how to violate<br/>The sacred fruit forbidden!  Some cursed fraud<br/>Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,<br/>And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee<br/>Certain my resolution is to die:<br/>How can I live without thee! how forego<br/>Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,<br/>To live again in these wild woods forlorn!<br/>Should God create another Eve, and I<br/>Another rib afford, yet loss of thee<br/>Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel<br/>The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,<br/>Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state<br/>Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.<br/>So having said, as one from sad dismay<br/>Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed<br/>Submitting to what seemed remediless,<br/>Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.<br/>Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,<br/>And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,<br/>Had it been only coveting to eye<br/>That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,<br/>Much more to taste it under ban to touch.<br/>But past who can recall, or done undo?<br/>Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so<br/>Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact<br/>Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,<br/>Profaned first by the serpent, by him first<br/>Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;<br/>Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;<br/>Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,<br/>Higher degree of life; inducement strong<br/>To us, as likely tasting to attain<br/>Proportional ascent; which cannot be<br/>But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.<br/>Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,<br/>Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy<br/>Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,<br/>Set over all his works; which in our fall,<br/>For us created, needs with us must fail,<br/>Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,<br/>Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;<br/>Not well conceived of God, who, though his power<br/>Creation could repeat, yet would be loth<br/>Us to abolish, lest the Adversary<br/>Triumph, and say; "Fickle their state whom God<br/>"Most favours; who can please him long? Me first<br/>"He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?"<br/>Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.<br/>However I with thee have fixed my lot,<br/>Certain to undergo like doom:  If death<br/>Consort with thee, death is to me as life;<br/>So forcible within my heart I feel<br/>The bond of Nature draw me to my own;<br/>My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;<br/>Our state cannot be severed; we are one,<br/>One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.<br/>So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.<br/>O glorious trial of exceeding love,<br/>Illustrious evidence, example high!<br/>Engaging me to emulate; but, short<br/>Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,<br/>Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,<br/>And gladly of our union hear thee speak,<br/>One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof<br/>This day affords, declaring thee resolved,<br/>Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,<br/>Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,<br/>To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,<br/>If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;<br/>Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,<br/>Direct, or by occasion, hath presented<br/>This happy trial of thy love, which else<br/>So eminently never had been known?<br/>Were it I thought death menaced would ensue<br/>This my attempt, I would sustain alone<br/>The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die<br/>Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact<br/>Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured<br/>Remarkably so late of thy so true,<br/>So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel<br/>Far otherwise the event; not death, but life<br/>Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,<br/>Taste so divine, that what of sweet before<br/>Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.<br/>On my experience, Adam, freely taste,<br/>And fear of death deliver to the winds.<br/>So saying, she embraced him, and for joy<br/>Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love<br/>Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur<br/>Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.<br/>In recompence for such compliance bad<br/>Such recompence best merits from the bough<br/>She gave him of that fair enticing fruit<br/>With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,<br/>Against his better knowledge; not deceived,<br/>But fondly overcome with female charm.<br/>Earth trembled from her entrails, as again<br/>In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;<br/>Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops<br/>Wept at completing of the mortal sin<br/>Original: while Adam took no thought,<br/>Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate<br/>Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth<br/>Him with her loved society; that now,<br/>As with new wine intoxicated both,<br/>They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel<br/>Divinity within them breeding wings,<br/>Wherewith to scorn the earth:  But that false fruit<br/>Far other operation first displayed,<br/>Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve<br/>Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him<br/>As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:<br/>Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move.<br/>Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,<br/>And elegant, of sapience no small part;<br/>Since to each meaning savour we apply,<br/>And palate call judicious; I the praise<br/>Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.<br/>Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained<br/>From this delightful fruit, nor known till now<br/>True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be<br/>In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,<br/>For this one tree had been forbidden ten.<br/>But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,<br/>As meet is, after such delicious fare;<br/>For never did thy beauty, since the day<br/>I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned<br/>With all perfections, so inflame my sense<br/>With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now<br/>Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!<br/>So said he, and forbore not glance or toy<br/>Of amorous intent; well understood<br/>Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.<br/>Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,<br/>Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,<br/>He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,<br/>Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,<br/>And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap.<br/>There they their fill of love and love's disport<br/>Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,<br/>The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep<br/>Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,<br/>Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,<br/>That with exhilarating vapour bland<br/>About their spirits had played, and inmost powers<br/>Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,<br/>Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams<br/>Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose<br/>As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,<br/>Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds<br/>How darkened; innocence, that as a veil<br/>Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;<br/>Just confidence, and native righteousness,<br/>And honour, from about them, naked left<br/>To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe<br/>Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong,<br/>Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap<br/>Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked<br/>Shorn of his strength.  They destitute and bare<br/>Of all their virtue:  Silent, and in face<br/>Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:<br/>Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,<br/>At length gave utterance to these words constrained.<br/>O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear<br/>To that false worm, of whomsoever taught<br/>To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall,<br/>False in our promised rising; since our eyes<br/>Opened we find indeed, and find we know<br/>Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;<br/>Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;<br/>Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,<br/>Of innocence, of faith, of purity,<br/>Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,<br/>And in our faces evident the signs<br/>Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;<br/>Even shame, the last of evils; of the first<br/>Be sure then.--How shall I behold the face<br/>Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy<br/>And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes<br/>Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze<br/>Insufferably bright.  O! might I here<br/>In solitude live savage; in some glade<br/>Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable<br/>To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad<br/>And brown as evening:  Cover me, ye Pines!<br/>Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs<br/>Hide me, where I may never see them more!--<br/>But let us now, as in bad plight, devise<br/>What best may for the present serve to hide<br/>The parts of each from other, that seem most<br/>To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;<br/>Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,<br/>And girded on our loins, may cover round<br/>Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,<br/>There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.<br/>So counselled he, and both together went<br/>Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose<br/>The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,<br/>But such as at this day, to Indians known,<br/>In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms<br/>Branching so broad and long, that in the ground<br/>The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow<br/>About the mother tree, a pillared shade<br/>High over-arched, and echoing walks between:<br/>There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,<br/>Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds<br/>At loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves<br/>They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;<br/>And, with what skill they had, together sewed,<br/>To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide<br/>Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike<br/>To that first naked glory!  Such of late<br/>Columbus found the American, so girt<br/>With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild<br/>Among the trees on isles and woody shores.<br/>Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part<br/>Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,<br/>They sat them down to weep; nor only tears<br/>Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within<br/>Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,<br/>Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore<br/>Their inward state of mind, calm region once<br/>And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:<br/>For Understanding ruled not, and the Will<br/>Heard not her lore; both in subjection now<br/>To sensual Appetite, who from beneath<br/>Usurping over sovran Reason claimed<br/>Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,<br/>Adam, estranged in look and altered style,<br/>Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.<br/>Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid<br/>With me, as I besought thee, when that strange<br/>Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,<br/>I know not whence possessed thee; we had then<br/>Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled<br/>Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!<br/>Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve<br/>The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek<br/>Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.<br/>To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.<br/>What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!<br/>Imputest thou that to my default, or will<br/>Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows<br/>But might as ill have happened thou being by,<br/>Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there,<br/>Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned<br/>Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;<br/>No ground of enmity between us known,<br/>Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.<br/>Was I to have never parted from thy side?<br/>As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.<br/>Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,<br/>Command me absolutely not to go,<br/>Going into such danger, as thou saidst?<br/>Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;<br/>Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.<br/>Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,<br/>Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.<br/>To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.<br/>Is this the love, is this the recompence<br/>Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed<br/>Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;<br/>Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,<br/>Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?<br/>And am I now upbraided as the cause<br/>Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe,<br/>It seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more<br/>I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold<br/>The danger, and the lurking enemy<br/>That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;<br/>And force upon free will hath here no place.<br/>But confidence then bore thee on; secure<br/>Either to meet no danger, or to find<br/>Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps<br/>I also erred, in overmuch admiring<br/>What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought<br/>No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue<br/>The errour now, which is become my crime,<br/>And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall<br/>Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,<br/>Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;<br/>And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,<br/>She first his weak indulgence will accuse.<br/>Thus they in mutual accusation spent<br/>The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;<br/>And of their vain contest appeared no end.
