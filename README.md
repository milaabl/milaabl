  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Poet's Calendar by *Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*

<p>
    January<br/><br/>Janus am I; oldest of potentates;<br/>Forward I look, and backward, and below<br/>I count, as god of avenues and gates,<br/>The years that through my portals come and go.<br/>I block the roads, and drift the fields with snow;<br/>I chase the wild-fowl from the frozen fen;<br/>My frosts congeal the rivers in their flow,<br/>My fires light up the hearths and hearts of men.<br/><br/>February<br/><br/>I am lustration, and the sea is mine!<br/>I wash the sands and headlands with my tide;<br/>My brow is crowned with branches of the pine;<br/>Before my chariot-wheels the fishes glide.<br/>By me all things unclean are purified,<br/>By me the souls of men washed white again;<br/>E'en the unlovely tombs of those who died<br/>Without a dirge, I cleanse from every stain.<br/><br/>March<br/><br/>I Martius am! Once first, and now the third!<br/>To lead the Year was my appointed place;<br/>A mortal dispossessed me by a word,<br/>And set there Janus with the double face.<br/>Hence I make war on all the human race;<br/>I shake the cities with my hurricanes;<br/>I flood the rivers and their banks efface,<br/>And drown the farms and hamlets with my rains.<br/><br/>April<br/><br/>I open wide the portals of the Spring<br/>To welcome the procession of the flowers,<br/>With their gay banners, and the birds that sing<br/>Their song of songs from their aerial towers.<br/>I soften with my sunshine and my showers<br/>The heart of earth; with thoughts of love I glide<br/>Into the hearts of men; and with the Hours<br/>Upon the Bull with wreathed horns I ride.<br/><br/>May<br/><br/>Hark! The sea-faring wild-fowl loud proclaim<br/>My coming, and the swarming of the bees.<br/>These are my heralds, and behold! my name<br/>Is written in blossoms on the hawthorn-trees.<br/>I tell the mariner when to sail the seas;<br/>I waft o'er all the land from far away<br/>The breath and bloom of the Hesperides,<br/>My birthplace. I am Maia. I am May.<br/><br/>June<br/><br/>Mine is the Month of Roses; yes, and mine<br/>The Month of Marriages! All pleasant sights<br/>And scents, the fragrance of the blossoming vine,<br/>The foliage of the valleys and the heights.<br/>Mine are the longest days, the loveliest nights;<br/>The mower's scythe makes music to my ear;<br/>I am the mother of all dear delights;<br/>I am the fairest daughter of the year.<br/><br/>July<br/><br/>My emblem is the Lion, and I breathe<br/>The breath of Libyan deserts o'er the land;<br/>My sickle as a sabre I unsheathe,<br/>And bent before me the pale harvests stand.<br/>The lakes and rivers shrink at my command,<br/>And there is thirst and fever in the air;<br/>The sky is changed to brass, the earth to sand;<br/>I am the Emperor whose name I bear.<br/><br/>August<br/><br/>The Emperor Octavian, called the August,<br/>I being his favorite, bestowed his name<br/>Upon me, and I hold it still in trust,<br/>In memory of him and of his fame.<br/>I am the Virgin, and my vestal flame<br/>Burns less intensely than the Lion's rage;<br/>Sheaves are my only garlands, and I claim<br/>The golden Harvests as my heritage.<br/><br/>September<br/><br/>I bear the Scales, where hang in equipoise<br/>The night and day; and whenunto my lips<br/>I put my trumpet, with its stress and noise<br/>Fly the white clouds like tattered sails of ships;<br/>The tree-tops lash the air with sounding whips;<br/>Southward the clamorous sea-fowl wing their flight;<br/>The hedges are all red with haws and hips,<br/>The Hunter's Moon reigns empress of the night.<br/><br/>October<br/><br/>My ornaments are fruits; my garments leaves,<br/>Woven like cloth of gold, and crimson dyed;<br/>I do no boast the harvesting of sheaves,<br/>O'er orchards and o'er vineyards I preside.<br/>Though on the frigid Scorpion I ride,<br/>The dreamy air is full, and overflows<br/>With tender memories of the summer-tide,<br/>And mingled voices of the doves and crows.<br/><br/>November<br/><br/>The Centaur, Sagittarius, am I,<br/>Born of Ixion's and the cloud's embrace;<br/>With sounding hoofs across the earth I fly,<br/>A steed Thessalian with a human face.<br/>Sharp winds the arrows are with which I chase<br/>The leaves, half dead already with affright;<br/>I shroud myself in gloom; and to the race<br/>Of mortals bring nor comfort nor delight.<br/><br/>December<br/><br/>Riding upon the Goat, with snow-white hair,<br/>I come, the last of all. This crown of mine<br/>Is of the holly; in my hand I bear<br/>The thyrsus, tipped with fragrant cones of pine.<br/>I celebrate the birth of the Divine,<br/>And the return of the Saturnian reign;--<br/>My songs are carols sung at every shrine,<br/>Proclaiming "Peace on earth, good will to men."
