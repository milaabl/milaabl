# üíÆ Absalom And Achitophel by *John Dryden*

<p>
    In pious times, ere priest-craft did begin,<br/>Before polygamy was made a sin;<br/>When man, on many, multipli'd his kind,<br/>Ere one to one was cursedly confin'd:<br/>When Nature prompted, and no Law deni'd<br/>Promiscuous use of concubine and bride;<br/>Then, Israel's monarch, after Heaven's own heart,<br/>His vigorous warmth did variously impart<br/>To wives and slaves: and, wide as his command,<br/>Scatter'd his Maker's image through the land.<br/>Michal, of royal blood, the crown did wear;<br/>A soil ungrateful to the tiller's care:<br/>Not so the rest; for several mothers bore<br/>To god-like David, several sons before.<br/>But since like slaves his bed they did ascend,<br/>No true succession could their seed attend.<br/>Of all this numerous progeny was none<br/>So beautiful, so brave, as Absalom:<br/>Whether, inspir'd by some diviner lust,<br/>His father got him with a greater gust;<br/>Or that his conscious destiny made way,<br/>By manly beauty to imperial sway.<br/>Early in foreign fields he won renown,<br/>With kings and states alli'd to Israel's crown:<br/>In peace the thoughts of war he could remove,<br/>And seem'd as he were only born for love.<br/>Whate'er he did, was done with so much ease,<br/>In him alone, 'twas natural to please:<br/>His motions all accompani'd with grace;<br/>And Paradise was open'd in his face.<br/>With secret joy, indulgent David view'd<br/>His youthful image in his son renew'd:<br/>To all his wishes nothing he deni'd;<br/>And made the charming Annabel his bride.<br/>What faults he had (for who from faults is free?)<br/>His father could not, or he would not see.<br/>Some warm excesses, which the Law forbore,<br/>Were constru'd youth that purged by boiling o'er:<br/>And Amnon's murther, by a specious name,<br/>Was call'd a just revenge for injur'd fame.<br/>Thus prais'd, and lov'd, the noble youth remain'd,<br/>While David, undisturb'd, in Sion reign'd.<br/>But life can never be sincerely blest:<br/>Heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best.<br/>The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murm'ring race,<br/>As ever tri'd th'extent and stretch of grace;<br/>God's pamper'd people whom, debauch'd with ease,<br/>No king could govern, nor no God could please;<br/>(Gods they had tri'd of every shape and size,<br/>That god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:)<br/>These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,<br/>Began to dream they wanted liberty:<br/>And when no rule, no precedent, was found<br/>Of men, by laws less circumscrib'd and bound,<br/>They led their wild desires to woods and caves,<br/>And thought that all but savages were slaves.<br/>They who, when Saul was dead, without a blow,<br/>Made foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego;<br/>Who banisht David did from Hebron bring,<br/>And, with a general shout, proclaim'd him king:<br/>Those very Jews, who, at their very best,<br/>Their Humour more than loyalty exprest,<br/>Now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'd<br/>An idol-monarch which their hands had made:<br/>Thought they might ruin him they could create;<br/>Or melt him to that golden calf, a state.<br/>But these were random bolts: no form'd design,<br/>Nor interest made the factious crowd to join:<br/>The sober part of Israel, free from stain,<br/>Well knew the value of a peaceful reign:<br/>And, looking backward with a wise afright,<br/>Saw seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight:<br/>In contemplation of whose ugly scars,<br/>They curst the memory of civil wars.<br/>The moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd,<br/>Inclin'd the balance to the better side:<br/>And, David's mildness manag'd it so well,<br/>The bad found no occasion to rebel.<br/>But, when to sin our bias'd nature leans,<br/>The careful Devil is still at hand with means;<br/>And providently pimps for ill desires:<br/>The good old cause reviv'd, a plot requires.<br/>Plots, true or false, are necessary things,<br/>To raise up common-wealths, and ruin kings.<br/><br/>  Th' inhabitants of old Jerusalem<br/>Were Jebusites: the town so call'd from them;<br/>And theirs the native right‚Äî<br/>But when the chosen people grew more strong,<br/>The rightful cause at length became the wrong:<br/>And every loss the men of Jebus bore,<br/>They still were thought God's enemies the more.<br/>Thus, worn and weaken'd, well or ill content,<br/>Submit they must to David's government:<br/>Impoverish'd and depriv'd of all command,<br/>Their taxes doubled as they lost their land;<br/>And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,<br/>Their gods disgrac'd, and burnt like common wood.<br/>This set the heathen priesthood in a flame;<br/>For priests of all religions are the same:<br/>Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,<br/>Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,<br/>In his defence his servants are as bold,<br/>As if he had been born of beaten gold.<br/>The Jewish Rabbins though their Enemies,<br/>In this conclude them honest men and wise:<br/>For 'twas their duty, all the learned think,<br/>T'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink.<br/>From hence began that plot, the nation's curse,<br/>Bad in itself, but represented worse.<br/>Rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decri'd;<br/>With oaths affirm'd, with dying vows deni'd.<br/>Not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the multitude;<br/>But swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude.<br/>Some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies;<br/>To please the fools, and puzzle all the wise.<br/>Succeeding times did equal folly call,<br/>Believing nothing, or believing all.<br/>Th' Egyptian rites the Jebusites embrac'd;<br/>Where gods were recommended by their taste.<br/>Such sav'ry deities must needs be good,<br/>As serv'd at once for worship and for food.<br/>By force they could not introduce these gods;<br/>For ten to one, in former days was odds.<br/>So fraud was us'd, (the sacrificers' trade,)<br/>Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.<br/>Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews;<br/>And rak'd, for converts, even the court and stews:<br/>Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took,<br/>Because the fleece accompanies the flock.<br/>Some thought they God's anointed meant to slay<br/>By guns, invented since full many a day:<br/>Our author swears it not; but who can know<br/>How far the Devil and Jebusites may go?<br/>This plot, which fail'd for want of common sense,<br/>Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence:<br/>For, as when raging fevers boil the blood,<br/>The standing lake soon floats into a flood;<br/>And ev'ry hostile humour, which before<br/>Slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er:<br/>So, several factions from this first ferment,<br/>Work up to foam, and threat the government.<br/>Some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise,<br/>Oppos'd the pow'r, to which they could not rise.<br/>Some had in courts been great, and thrown from thence,<br/>Like fiends, were harden'd in impenitence.<br/>Some by their monarch's fatal mercy grown,<br/>From pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne;<br/>Were rais'd in pow'r and public office high;<br/>Strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie.<br/><br/>Of these the false Achitophel was first:<br/>A name to all succeeding ages curst.<br/>For close designs, and crooked counsels fit;<br/>Sagacious, bold and turbulent of wit:<br/>Restless, unfixt in principles and place;<br/>In pow'r unpleas'd, impatient of disgrace.<br/>A fiery soul, which working out its way,<br/>Fretted the pigmy-body to decay:<br/>And o'er inform'd the tenement of clay.<br/>A daring pilot in extremity;<br/>Pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went high<br/>He sought the storms; but for a calm unfit,<br/>Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit.<br/>Great wits are sure to madness near alli'd;<br/>And thin partitions do their bounds divide:<br/>Else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest,<br/>Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?<br/>Punish a body which he could not please;<br/>Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?<br/>And all to leave, what with his toil he won<br/>To that unfeather'd, two-legg'd thing, a son:<br/>Got, while his soul did huddled notions try;<br/>And born a shapeless lump, like anarchy.<br/>In friendship false, implacable in hate:<br/>Resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state.<br/>To compass this, the triple bond he broke;<br/>The pillars of the public safety shook:<br/>And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke.<br/>Then, seiz'd with fear, yet still affecting fame,<br/>Usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name.<br/>So easy still it proves in factious times,<br/>With public zeal to cancel private crimes:<br/>How safe is treason, and how sacred ill,<br/>Where none can sin against the people's will:<br/>Where crowds can wink; and no offence be known,<br/>Since in another's guilt they find their own.<br/>Yet, fame deserv'd, no enemy can grudge;<br/>The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge.<br/>In Jewish courts ne'er sat an Abbethdin<br/>With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean:<br/>Unbrib'd, unsought, the wretched to redress;<br/>Swift of dispatch, and easy of access.<br/>Oh, had he been content to serve the crown,<br/>With virtues only proper to the gown;<br/>Or, had the rankness of the soil been freed<br/>From cockle, that opprest the noble seed:<br/>David, for him his tuneful harp had strung,<br/>And heav'n had wanted one immortal song.<br/>But wild ambition loves to slide, not stand;<br/>And fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land:<br/>Achitophel, grown weary to possess<br/>A lawful fame, and lazy happiness;<br/>Disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free,<br/>And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree.<br/>Now, manifest of crimes, contriv'd long since,<br/>He stood at bold defiance with his prince:<br/>Held up the buckler of the people's cause,<br/>Against the crown; and skulk'd behind the laws.<br/>The wish'd occasion of the plot he takes;<br/>Some circumstances finds, but more he makes.<br/>By buzzing emissaries, fills the ears<br/>Of list'ning crowds, with jealousies and fears<br/>Of arbitrary counsels brought to light,<br/>And proves the king himself a Jebusite.<br/>Weak arguments! which yet he knew full well,<br/>Were strong with people easy to rebel.<br/>For, govern'd by the moon, the giddy Jews<br/>Tread the same track when she the prime renews:<br/>And once in twenty years, their scribes record,<br/>By natural instinct they change their lord.<br/>Achitophel still wants a chief, and none<br/>Was found so fit as warlike Absalom:<br/>Not, that he wish'd his greatness to create,<br/>(For politicians neither love nor hate:)<br/>But, for he knew, his title not allow'd,<br/>Would keep him still depending on the crowd:<br/>That kingly pow'r, thus ebbing out, might be<br/>Drawn to the dregs of a democracy.<br/>Him he attempts, with studied arts to please,<br/>And sheds his venom, in such words as these.<br/><br/>Auspicious Prince! at whose nativity<br/>Some royal planet rul'd the southern sky;<br/>Thy longing country's darling and desire;<br/>Their cloudy pillar, and their guardian fire:<br/>Their second Moses, whose extended wand<br/>Divides the seas, and shows the promis'd land:<br/>Whose dawning day, in very distant age,<br/>Has exercis'd the sacred prophet's rage:<br/>The people's pray'r, the glad diviner's theme,<br/>The young men's vision, and the old men's dream!<br/>Thee, Saviour, thee, the nation's vows confess;<br/>And, never satisfi'd with seeing, bless:<br/>Swift, unbespoken pomps, thy steps proclaim,<br/>And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name.<br/>How long wilt thou the general joy detain;<br/>Starve, and defraud the people of thy reign?<br/>Content ingloriously to pass thy days<br/>Like one of virtue's fools that feeds on praise;<br/>Till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright,<br/>Grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight.<br/>Believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be,<br/>Or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree.<br/>Heav'n has to all allotted, soon or late,<br/>Some lucky revolution of their fate:<br/>Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill,<br/>(For human good depends on human will,)<br/>Our fortune rolls, as from a smooth descent,<br/>And, from the first impression, takes the bent:<br/>But, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind;<br/>And leaves repenting folly far behind.<br/>Now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize,<br/>And spreads her locks before her as she flies.<br/>Had thus Old David, from whose loins you spring,<br/>Not dar'd, when fortune call'd him, to be king.<br/>At Gath an exile he might still remain;<br/>And Heaven's anointing oil had been in vain.<br/>Let his successful youth your hopes engage;<br/>But shun th'example of declining age:<br/>Behold him setting in his western skies,<br/>The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise.<br/>He is not now, as when on Jordan's sand<br/>The joyful people throng'd to see him land,<br/>Cov'ring the beach, and black'ning all the strand:<br/>But, like the Prince of Angels from his height,<br/>Comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light:<br/>Betray'd by one poor plot to public scorn:<br/>(Our only blessing since his curst return:)<br/>Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind,<br/>Blown off, and scatter'd by a puff of wind.<br/>What strength can he to your designs oppose,<br/>Naked of friends and round beset with foes?<br/>If Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use,<br/>A foreign aid would more incense the Jews:<br/>Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring;<br/>Foment the war, but not support the king:<br/>Nor would the royal party e'er unite<br/>With Pharaoh's arms, t'assist the Jebusite;<br/>Or if they should, their interest soon would break,<br/>And with such odious aid, make David weak.<br/>All sorts of men, by my successful arts,<br/>Abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts<br/>From David's rule: And 'tis the general Cry,<br/>Religion, Common-wealth, and Liberty.<br/>If, you, as champion of the public good,<br/>Add to their arms a chief of royal blood;<br/>What may not Israel hope, and what applause<br/>Might such a general gain by such a cause?<br/>Not barren praise alone, that gaudy flow'r,<br/>Fair only to the sight, but solid pow'r:<br/>And nobler is a limited command,<br/>Giv'n by the love of all your native land,<br/>Than a successive title, long, and dark,<br/>Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's Ark.<br/><br/>What cannot praise effect in mighty minds,<br/>When flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds!<br/>Desire of pow'r, on earth a vicious weed,<br/>Yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed:<br/>In God 'tis glory: And when men aspire,<br/>'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire.<br/>Th' ambitious youth, too covetous of fame,<br/>Too full of angel's metal in his frame;<br/>Unwarily was led from virtue's ways;<br/>Made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise.<br/>Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,<br/>(For loyal blood within him struggled still)<br/>He thus repli'd.‚ÄîAnd what pretence have I<br/>To take up arms for public liberty?<br/>My Father governs with unquestion'd right;<br/>The Faith's defender, and mankind's delight:<br/>Good, gracious, just, observant of the laws;<br/>And Heav'n by wonders has espous'd his cause.<br/>Whom has he wrong'd in all his peaceful reign?<br/>Who sues for justice to his throne in vain?<br/>What millions has he pardon'd of his foes,<br/>Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose?<br/>Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good;<br/>Inclin'd to mercy, and averse from blood.<br/>If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,<br/>His crime is God's beloved attribute.<br/>What could he gain, his people to betray,<br/>Or change his right, for arbitrary sway?<br/>Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign,<br/>His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train.<br/>If David's rule Jerusalem displease,<br/>The Dog-star heats their brains to this disease.<br/>Why then should I, encouraging the bad,<br/>Turn rebel, and run popularly mad?<br/>Were he a tyrant who, by lawless might,<br/>Oppress'd the Jews, and rais'd the Jebusite,<br/>Well might I mourn; but nature's holy bands<br/>Would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands:<br/>The people might assert their liberty;<br/>But what was right in them, were crime in me.<br/>His favour leaves me nothing to require;<br/>Prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire.<br/>What more can I expect while David lives?<br/>All but his kingly diadem he gives:<br/>And that: but there he paus'd; then sighing, said,<br/>Is justly destin'd for a worthier head.<br/>For when my father from his toils shall rest,<br/>And late augment the number of the blest:<br/>His lawful issue shall the throne ascend;<br/>Or the collat'ral line where that shall end.<br/>His brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite,<br/>Yet dauntless and secure of native right,<br/>Of every royal virtue stands possess'd;<br/>Still dear to all the bravest, and the best.<br/>His courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim;<br/>His loyalty the king, the world his fame.<br/>His mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find:<br/>For sure he comes of a forgiving kind.<br/>Why should I then repine at Heaven's decree;<br/>Which gives me no pretence to royalty?<br/>Yet oh that Fate, propitiously inclin'd,<br/>Had rais'd my birth, or had debas'd my mind;<br/>To my large soul, not all her treasure lent,<br/>And then betray'd it to a mean descent.<br/>I find, I find my mounting spirits bold,<br/>And David's part disdains my mother's mold.<br/>Why am I scanted by a niggard-birth?<br/>My soul disclaims the kindred of her earth:<br/>And made for empire, whispers me within;<br/>Desire of greatness is a god-like sin.<br/><br/>Him staggering so when Hell's dire agent found,<br/>While fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground,<br/>He pours fresh forces in, and thus replies:<br/><br/>Th'eternal God, supremely good and wise,<br/>Imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain;<br/>What wonders are reserv'd to bless your reign?<br/>Against your will your arguments have shown,<br/>Such virtue's only giv'n to guide a throne.<br/>Not that your father's mildness I contemn;<br/>But manly force becomes the diadem.<br/>'Tis true, he grants the people all they crave;<br/>And more perhaps than subjects ought to have:<br/>For lavish grants suppose a monarch tame,<br/>And more his goodness than his wit proclaim.<br/>But when should people strive their bonds to break,<br/>If not when kings are negligent or weak?<br/>Let him give on till he can give no more,<br/>The thrifty Sanhedrin shall keep him poor:<br/>And every shekel which he can receive,<br/>Shall cost a limb of his prerogative.<br/>To ply him with new plots, shall be my care;<br/>Or plunge him deep in some expensive war;<br/>Which, when his treasure can no more supply,<br/>He must, with the remains of kingship, buy.<br/>His faithful friends, our jealousies and fears<br/>Call Jebusites; and Pharaoh's pensioners:<br/>Whom, when our fury from his aid has torn,<br/>He shall be naked left to public scorn.<br/>The next successor, whom I fear and hate,<br/>My arts have made obnoxious to the state;<br/>Turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow,<br/>And gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe.<br/>His right, for sums of necessary gold,<br/>Shall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold:<br/>Till time shall ever-wanting David draw,<br/>To pass your doubtful title into law:<br/>If not; the people have a right supreme<br/>To make their kings; for kings are made for them.<br/>All empire is no more than pow'r in trust:<br/>Which when resum'd, can be no longer just.<br/>Succession, for the general good design'd,<br/>In its own wrong a nation cannot bind:<br/>If altering that, the people can relieve,<br/>Better one suffer, than a nation grieve.<br/>The Jews well know their pow'r: ere Saul they chose,<br/>God was their king, and God they durst depose.<br/>Urge now your piety, your filial name,<br/>A father's right, and fear of future fame;<br/>The public good, the universal call,<br/>To which even Heav'n submitted, answers all.<br/>Nor let his love enchant your generous mind;<br/>'Tis Nature's trick to propagate her kind.<br/>Our fond begetters, who would never die,<br/>Love but themselves in their posterity.<br/>Or let his kindness by th'effects be tri'd,<br/>Or let him lay his vain pretence aside.<br/>God said he lov'd your father; could he bring<br/>A better proof, than to anoint him king?<br/>It surely show'd he lov'd the shepherd well,<br/>Who gave so fair a flock as Israel.<br/>Would David have you thought his darling son?<br/>What means he then, to alienate the crown?<br/>The name of godly he may blush to bear:<br/>'Tis after God's own heart to cheat his heir.<br/>He to his brother gives supreme command;<br/>To you a legacy of barren land:<br/>Perhaps th'old harp, on which he thrums his lays:<br/>Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise.<br/>Then the next heir, a prince, severe and wise<br/>Already looks on you with jealous eyes;<br/>Sees through the thin disguises of your arts,<br/>And marks your progress in the people's hearts.<br/>Though now his mighty soul in grief contains,<br/>He meditates revenge who least complains;<br/>And like a lion, slumb'ring in the way,<br/>Or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey,<br/>His fearless foes within his distance draws;<br/>Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws:<br/>Till at the last, his time for fury found,<br/>He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:<br/>The prostrate vulgar, passes o'er, and spares;<br/>But with a lordly rage, his hunters tears.<br/>Your case no tame expedients will afford;<br/>Resolve on death, or conquest by the sword,<br/>Which for no less a stake than life, you draw;<br/>And self-defence is Nature's eldest law.<br/>Leave the warm people no considering time;<br/>For then rebellion may be thought a crime.<br/>Prevail yourself of what occasion gives,<br/>But try your title while your father lives:<br/>And that your arms may have a fair pretence,<br/>Proclaim, you take them in the king's defence:<br/>Whose sacred life each minute would expose<br/>To plots from seeming friends and secret foes.<br/>And who can sound the depth of David's soul?<br/>Perhaps his fear, his kindness may control.<br/>He fears his brother, though he loves his son,<br/>For plighted vows too late to be undone.<br/>If so, by force he wishes to be gain'd;<br/>Like women's lechery, to seem constrain'd:<br/>Doubt not; but when he most affects the frown,<br/>Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown.<br/>Secure his person to secure your cause;<br/>They who possess the prince, possess the laws.<br/><br/>He said, and this advice above the rest<br/>With Absalom's mild nature suited best;<br/>Unblam'd of life, (ambition set aside,)<br/>Not stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride.<br/>How happy had he been, if destiny<br/>Had higher plac'd his birth, or not so high!<br/>His kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne;<br/>And blest all other countries but his own:<br/>But charming greatness since so few refuse,<br/>'Tis juster to lament him, than accuse.<br/>Strong were his hopes a rival to remove,<br/>With blandishments to gain the public love;<br/>To head the faction while their zeal was hot,<br/>And popularly prosecute the plot.<br/>To farther this Achitophel unites<br/>The malcontents of all the Israelites:<br/>Whose differing parties he could wisely join,<br/>For several ends, to serve the same design.<br/>The best, and of the princes some were such,<br/>Who thought the pow'r of monarchy too much:<br/>Mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts;<br/>Not wicked, but seduc'd by impious arts.<br/>By these the springs of property were bent,<br/>And wound so high, they crack'd the government.<br/>The next for interest sought t'embroil the state,<br/>To sell their duty at a dearer rate;<br/>And make their Jewish markets of the throne;<br/>Pretending public good, to serve their own.<br/>Others thought kings an useless heavy load,<br/>Who cost too much, and did too little good.<br/>These were for laying honest David by,<br/>On principles of pure good husbandry.<br/>With them join'd all th'haranguers of the throng,<br/>That thought to get preferment by the tongue.<br/>Who follow next, a double danger bring,<br/>Not only hating David, but the king;<br/>The Solymaean rout; well vers'd of old<br/>In godly faction, and in treason bold;<br/>Cow'ring and quaking at a conqu'ror's sword,<br/>But lofty to a lawful prince restor'd;<br/>Saw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun,<br/>And scorn'd by Jebusites to be out-done.<br/>Hot Levites headed these; who pull'd before<br/>From th'Ark, which in the Judges' days they bore,<br/>Resum'd their Cant, and with a zealous cry,<br/>Pursu'd their old belov'd Theocracy.<br/>Where Sanhedrin and Priest enslav'd the nation,<br/>And justifi'd their spoils by inspiration:<br/>For who so fit for reign as Aaron's race,<br/>If once dominion they could found in Grace?<br/>These led the pack; though not of surest scent,<br/>Yet deepest mouth'd against the government.<br/>A numerous host of dreaming saints succeed;<br/>Of the true old enthusiastic breed:<br/>'Gainst form and order they their pow'r employ;<br/>Nothing to build, and all things to destroy.<br/>But far more numerous was the herd of such,<br/>Who think too little, and who talk too much.<br/>These, out of mere instinct, they knew not why,<br/>Ador'd their father's God, and property:<br/>And by the same blind benefit of fate,<br/>The Devil and the Jebusite did hate:<br/>Born to be saved even in their own despite;<br/>Because they could not help believing right.<br/>Such were the tools; but a whole Hydra more<br/>Remains, of sprouting heads too long, to score.<br/>Some of their chiefs were princes of the land:<br/>In the first rank of these did Zimri stand:<br/>A man so various, that he seem'd to be<br/>Not one, but all Mankind's Epitome.<br/>Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;<br/>Was everything by starts, and nothing long:<br/>But in the course of one revolving moon,<br/>Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:<br/>Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking;<br/>Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.<br/>Blest madman, who could every hour employ,<br/>With something new to wish, or to enjoy!<br/>Railing and praising were his usual themes;<br/>And both (to show his judgment) in extremes:<br/>So over violent, or over civil,<br/>That every man, with him, was god or devil.<br/>In squandering wealth was his peculiar art:<br/>Nothing went unrewarded, but desert.<br/>Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late:<br/>He had his jest, and they had his estate.<br/>He laugh'd himself from court; then sought relief<br/>By forming parties, but could ne'er be chief:<br/>For, spite of him, the weight of business fell<br/>On Absalom and wise Achitophel:<br/>Thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft,<br/>He left not faction, but of that was left.<br/><br/>Titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse<br/>Of lords, below the dignity of verse.<br/>Wits, warriors, commonwealths-men, were the best:<br/>Kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest.<br/>And, therefore in the name of dullness, be<br/>The well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free.<br/>And canting Nadab let oblivion damn,<br/>Who made new porridge for the Paschal Lamb.<br/>Let friendship's holy band some names assure:<br/>Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure.<br/>Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place,<br/>Whom kings no titles gave, and God no grace:<br/>Not bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes draw<br/>To mean rebellion, and make treason law.<br/>But he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse,<br/>The wretch, who Heav'n's Anointed dar'd to curse.<br/>Shimei, whose youth did early promise bring<br/>Of zeal to God, and hatred to his king;<br/>Did wisely from expensive sins refrain,<br/>And never broke the Sabbath, but for gain:<br/>Nor ever was he known an oath to vent,<br/>Or curse, unless against the government.<br/>Thus, heaping wealth, by the most ready way<br/>Among the Jews, which was to cheat and pray;<br/>The city, to reward his pious hate<br/>Against his master, chose him magistrate:<br/>His hand a vare of justice did uphold;<br/>His neck was loaded with a chain of gold.<br/>During his office, treason was no crime.<br/>The sons of Belial had a glorious time:<br/>For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,<br/>Yet lov'd his wicked neighbour as himself:<br/>When two or three were gather'd to declaim<br/>Against the monarch of Jerusalem,<br/>Shimei was always in the midst of them.<br/>And, if they curst the king when he was by,<br/>Would rather curse, than break good company.<br/>If any durst his factious friends accuse,<br/>He pack'd a jury of dissenting Jews:<br/>Whose fellow-feeling, in the godly cause,<br/>Would free the suff'ring saint from human laws.<br/>For laws are only made to punish those<br/>Who serve the king, and to protect his foes.<br/>If any leisure time he had from pow'r,<br/>(Because 'tis sin to mis-employ an hour;)<br/>His bus'ness was, by writing, to persuade,<br/>That kings were useless, and a clog to trade:<br/>And, that his noble style he might refine,<br/>No Rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wine.<br/>Chaste were his cellars; and his shrieval board<br/>The grossness of a city feast abhorr'd:<br/>His cooks, with long disuse, their trade forgot;<br/>Cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot.<br/>Such frugal virtue malice may accuse;<br/>But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews:<br/>For towns once burnt, such magistrates require<br/>As dare not tempt God's providence by fire.<br/>With spiritual food he fed his servants well,<br/>But free from flesh, that made the Jews rebel:<br/>And Moses' laws he held in more account<br/>For forty days of fasting in the mount.<br/>To speak the rest, who better are forgot,<br/>Would tire a well-breath'd witness of the plot:<br/>Yet, Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass;<br/>Erect thyself thou monumental brass:<br/>High as the serpent of thy metal made,<br/>While nations stand secure beneath thy shade.<br/>What though his birth were base, yet comets rise<br/>From earthy vapours e'er they shine in skies.<br/>Prodigious actions may as well be done<br/>By weaver's issue, as by prince's son.<br/>This arch-attestor, for the public good,<br/>By that one deed ennobles all his blood.<br/>Who ever ask'd the witnesses' high race,<br/>Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace?<br/>Ours was a Levite, and as times went then,<br/>His tribe were God-almighty's gentlemen.<br/>Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud,<br/>Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud:<br/>His long chin prov'd his wit; his saint-like grace<br/>A church vermilion, and a Moses' face.<br/>His memory, miraculously great,<br/>Could plots exceeding man's belief, repeat;<br/>Which therefore cannot be accounted lies,<br/>For human wit could never such devise.<br/>Some future truths are mingled in his book;<br/>But, where the witness fail'd, the Prophet spoke:<br/>Some things like visionary flights appear;<br/>The spirit caught him up, the Lord knows where:<br/>And gave him his rabbinical degree,<br/>Unknown to foreign university.<br/>His judgment yet his mem'ry did excel:<br/>Which piec'd his wondrous evidence so well:<br/>And suited to the temper of the times;<br/>Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes.<br/>Let Israel's foes suspect his Heav'nly call,<br/>And rashly judge his writ apocryphal;<br/>Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made:<br/>He takes his life, who takes away his trade.<br/>Were I myself in witness Corah's place,<br/>The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace,<br/>Should whet my memory, though once forgot,<br/>To make him an appendix of my plot.<br/>His zeal to Heav'n made him his prince despise,<br/>And load his person with indignities:<br/>But Zeal peculiar privilege affords,<br/>Indulging latitude to deeds and words.<br/>And Corah might for Agag's murther call,<br/>In terms as coarse as Samuel us'd to Saul.<br/>What others in his evidence did join,<br/>(The best that could be had for love or coin,)<br/>In Corah's own predicament will fall:<br/>For Witness is a common name to all.<br/><br/>Surrounded thus with friends of every sort,<br/>Deluded Absalom forsakes the court:<br/>Impatient of high hopes, urg'd with renown,<br/>And fir'd with near possession of a crown:<br/>Th' admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise,<br/>And on his goodly person feed their eyes:<br/>His joy conceal'd, he sets himself to show;<br/>On each side bowing popularly low:<br/>His looks, his gestures, and his words he frames,<br/>And with familiar ease repeats their names.<br/>Thus, form'd by Nature, furnish'd out with arts,<br/>He glides unfelt into their secret hearts:<br/>Then, with a kind compassionating look,<br/>And sighs, bespeaking pity e'er he spoke:<br/>Few words he said; but easy those and fit:<br/>More slow than Hybla drops, and far more sweet.<br/><br/>I mourn, my country-men, your lost estate;<br/>Though far unable to prevent your fate:<br/>Behold a banish'd man, for your dear cause<br/>Expos'd a prey to arbitrary laws!<br/>Yet oh! that I alone could be undone,<br/>Cut off from empire, and no more a son!<br/>Now all your liberties a spoil are made;<br/>Egypt and Tyrus intercept your trade,<br/>And Jebusites your sacred rites invade.<br/>My father, whom with reverence yet I name,<br/>Charm'd into ease, is careless of his fame:<br/>And, brib'd with petty sums of foreign gold,<br/>Is grown in Bathsheba's embraces old:<br/>Exalts his enemies, his friends destroys:<br/>And all his pow'r against himself employs.<br/>He gives, and let him give my right away:<br/>But why should he his own, and yours betray?<br/>He, only he can make the nation bleed,<br/>And he alone from my revenge is freed.<br/>Take then my tears (with that he wip'd his eyes)<br/>'Tis all the aid my present pow'r supplies:<br/>No court-informer can these arms accuse;<br/>These arms may sons against their fathers use;<br/>And, 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign<br/>May make no other Israelite complain.<br/><br/>Youth, beauty, graceful action, seldom fail:<br/>But common interest always will prevail:<br/>And pity never ceases to be shown<br/>To him, who makes the people's wrongs his own.<br/>The crowd, (that still believe their kings oppress,)<br/>With lifted hands their young Messiah bless:<br/>Who now begins his progress to ordain;<br/>With chariots, horsemen, and a num'rous train:<br/>From East to West his glories he displays:<br/>And, like the sun, the Promis'd Land surveys.<br/>Fame runs before him, as the Morning-Star;<br/>And shouts of joy salute him from afar:<br/>Each house receives him as a guardian God;<br/>And consecrates the place of his abode:<br/>But hospitable treats did most commend<br/>Wise Issachar, his wealthy western friend.<br/>This moving court, that caught the people's eyes,<br/>And seem'd but pomp, did other ends disguise:<br/>Achitophel had form'd it, with intent<br/>To sound the depths, and fathom where it went,<br/>The people's hearts; distinguish friends from foes;<br/>And try their strength, before they came to blows.<br/>Yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretence<br/>Of specious love, and duty to their prince.<br/>Religion, and redress of grievances,<br/>Two names, that always cheat and always please,<br/>Are often urg'd; and good King David's life<br/>Endanger'd by a brother and a wife.<br/>Thus, in a pageant show, a plot is made;<br/>And peace itself is war in masquerade.<br/>Oh foolish Israel! never warn'd by ill:<br/>Still the same bait, and circumvented still!<br/>Did ever men forsake their present ease,<br/>In midst of health imagine a disease;<br/>Take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee,<br/>Make heirs for monarchs, and for God decree?<br/>What shall we think! Can people give away<br/>Both for themselves and sons, their native sway?<br/>Then they are left defenceless to the sword<br/>Of each unbounded arbitrary lord:<br/>And laws are vain, by which we right enjoy,<br/>If kings unquestion'd can those laws destroy.<br/>Yet, if the crowd be judge of fit and just,<br/>And kings are only officers in trust,<br/>Then this resuming cov'nant was declar'd<br/>When Kings were made, or is for ever bar'd:<br/>If those who gave the sceptre could not tie<br/>By their own deed their own posterity,<br/>How then could Adam bind his future race?<br/>How could his forfeit on mankind take place?<br/>Or how could heavenly justice damn us all,<br/>Who ne'er consented to our father's fall?<br/>Then kings are slaves to those whom they command,<br/>And tenants to their people's pleasure stand.<br/>Add, that the pow'r for property allow'd,<br/>Is mischievously seated in the crowd:<br/>For who can be secure of private right,<br/>If sovereign sway may be dissolv'd by might?<br/>Nor is the people's judgment always true:<br/>The most may err as grossly as the few.<br/>And faultless kings run down, by common cry,<br/>For vice, oppression and for tyranny.<br/>What standard is there in a fickle rout,<br/>Which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out?<br/>Nor only crowds, but Sanhedrins may be<br/>Infected with this public lunacy:<br/>And share the madness of rebellious times,<br/>To murther monarchs for imagin'd crimes.<br/>If they may give and take whene'er they please,<br/>Not kings alone, (the godhead's images,)<br/>But government itself at length must fall<br/>To nature's state, where all have right to all.<br/>Yet, grant our lords the people kings can make,<br/>What prudent men a settled throne would shake?<br/>For whatsoe'er their sufferings were before,<br/>That change they covet makes them suffer more.<br/>All other errors but disturb a state;<br/>But innovation is the blow of fate.<br/>If ancient fabrics nod, and threat to fall,<br/>To patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall,<br/>Thus far 'tis duty; but here fix the mark:<br/>For all beyond it is to touch our Ark.<br/>To change foundations, cast the frame anew,<br/>Is work for rebels who base ends pursue:<br/>At once divine and human laws control;<br/>And mend the parts by ruin of the whole.<br/>The tamp'ring world is subject to this curse,<br/>To physic their disease into a worse.<br/><br/>Now what relief can righteous David bring?<br/>How fatal 'tis to be too good a king!<br/>Friends he has few, so high the madness grows;<br/>Who dare be such, must be the people's foes:<br/>Yet some there were, ev'n in the worst of days;<br/>Some let me name, and naming is to praise.<br/><br/>In this short file Barzillai first appears;<br/>Barzillai crown'd with honour and with years:<br/>Long since, the rising rebels he withstood<br/>In regions waste, beyond the Jordan's flood:<br/>Unfortunately brave to buoy the state;<br/>But sinking underneath his master's fate:<br/>In exile with his god-like prince he mourn'd:<br/>For him he suffer'd, and with him return'd.<br/>The court he practis'd, not the courtier's art:<br/>Large was his wealth, but larger was his heart:<br/>Which well the noblest objects knew to choose,<br/>The fighting warrior, and recording Muse.<br/>His bed could once a fruitful issue boast:<br/>Now more than half a father's name is lost.<br/>His eldest hope, with every grace adorn'd,<br/>By me (so Heav'n will have it) always mourn'd,<br/>And always honour'd, snatch'd in manhood's prime<br/>B' unequal Fates, and Providence's crime:<br/>Yet not before the goal of honour won,<br/>All parts fulfill'd, of subject and of son;<br/>Swift was the race, but short the time to run.<br/>Oh narrow circle, but of pow'r divine,<br/>Scanted in space, but perfect in thy line!<br/>By sea, by land, thy matchless worth was known;<br/>Arms thy delight, and war was all thy own:<br/>Thy force infus'd, the fainting Tyrians propp'd:<br/>And haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stopp'd.<br/>Oh ancient honour, Oh unconquer'd Hand,<br/>Whom foes unpunish'd never could withstand!<br/>But Israel was unworthy of thy name:<br/>Short is the date of all immoderate fame.<br/>It looks as Heav'n our ruin had design'd,<br/>And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind.<br/>Now, free from earth, thy disencumber'd Soul<br/>Mounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole:<br/>From thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring,<br/>To aid the Guardian Angel of thy king.<br/>Here stop my Muse, here cease thy painful flight;<br/>No pinions can pursue immortal height:<br/>Tell good Barzillai thou canst sing no more,<br/>And tell thy soul she should have fled before;<br/>Or fled she with his life, and left this verse<br/>To hang on her departed patron's hearse?<br/>Now take thy steepy flight from Heav'n, and see<br/>If thou canst find on earth another he;<br/>Another he would be too hard to find,<br/>See then whom thou canst see not far behind.<br/>Zadoc the priest whom, shunning, pow'r and place,<br/>His lowly mind advanc'd to David's grace:<br/>With him the Sagan of Jerusalem,<br/>Of hospitable soul and noble stem;<br/>Him of the western dome, whose weighty sense<br/>Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence.<br/>The Prophet's sons by such example led,<br/>To learning and to loyalty were bred:<br/>For colleges on bounteous kings depend,<br/>And never rebel was to arts a friend.<br/>To these succeed the pillars of the laws,<br/>Who best could plead, and best can judge a cause.<br/>Next them a train of loyal peers ascend:<br/>Sharp judging Adriel, the Muse's friend,<br/>Himself a Muse:‚Äîin Sanhedrin's debate<br/>True to his prince; but not a slave of state.<br/>Whom David's love with honours did adorn,<br/>That from his disobedient son were torn.<br/>Jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought,<br/>Endow'd by Nature, and by learning taught<br/>To move assemblies, who but only tri'd<br/>The worse awhile, then chose the better side;<br/>Nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too;<br/>So much the weight of one brave man can do.<br/>Hushai, the friend of David in distress,<br/>In public storms of manly steadfastness;<br/>By foreign treaties he inform'd his youth;<br/>And join'd experience to his native truth.<br/>His frugal care suppli'd the wanting throne;<br/>Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own:<br/>'Tis easy conduct when exchequers flow;<br/>But hard the task to manage well the low:<br/>For sovereign power is too depress'd or high,<br/>When kings are forc'd to sell, or crowds to buy.<br/>Indulge one labour more, my weary Muse,<br/>For Amiel, who can Amiel's praise refuse?<br/>Of ancient race by birth, but nobler yet<br/>In his own worth, and without title great:<br/>The Sanhedrin long time as chief he rul'd,<br/>Their reason guided, and their passion cool'd;<br/>So dext'rous was he in the crown's defence,<br/>So form'd to speak a loyal nation's sense,<br/>That as their band was Israel's tribes in small,<br/>So fit was he to represent them all.<br/>Now rasher charioteers the seat ascend,<br/>Whose loose careers his steady skill commend:<br/>They, like th'unequal ruler of the day,<br/>Misguide the seasons and mistake the way;<br/>While he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles,<br/>And safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils.<br/><br/>These were the chief; a small but faithful band<br/>Of worthies, in the breach who dar'd to stand,<br/>And tempt th'united fury of the land.<br/>With grief they view'd such powerful engines bent,<br/>To batter down the lawful government.<br/>A numerous faction with pretended frights,<br/>In Sanhedrins to plume the regal rights.<br/>The true successor from the court remov'd:<br/>The plot, by hireling witnesses, improv'd.<br/>These ills they saw, and as their duty bound,<br/>They show'd the king the danger of the wound:<br/>That no concessions from the throne would please;<br/>But lenitives fomented the disease:<br/>That Absalom, ambitious of the crown,<br/>Was made the lure to draw the people down:<br/>That false Achitophel's pernicious hate,<br/>Had turn'd the plot to ruin church and state:<br/>The Council violent, the rabble worse:<br/>That Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse.<br/><br/>With all these loads of injuries opprest,<br/>And long revolving in his careful breast<br/>Th'event of things; at last his patience tir'd,<br/>Thus from his royal throne, by Heav'n inspir'd,<br/>The god-like David spoke; and awful fear<br/>His train their Maker in their Master hear.<br/><br/>Thus long have I by native mercy sway'd,<br/>My wrongs dissembl'd, my revenge delay'd:<br/>So willing to forgive th'offending age;<br/>So much the father did the king assuage.<br/>But now so far my clemency they slight,<br/>Th' offenders question my forgiving right.<br/>That one was made for many, they contend:<br/>But 'tis to rule, for that's a monarch's end.<br/>They call my tenderness of blood, my fear:<br/>Though manly tempers can the longest bear.<br/>Yet, since they will divert my native course,<br/>'Tis time to shew I am not good by force.<br/>Those heap'd affronts that haughty subjects bring,<br/>Are burdens for a camel, not a king:<br/>Kings are the public pillars of the state,<br/>Born to sustain and prop the nation's weight:<br/>If my young Sampson will pretend a call<br/>To shake the column, let him share the fall:<br/>But oh that yet he would repent and live!<br/>How easy 'tis for parents to forgive!<br/>With how few tears a pardon might be won<br/>From Nature, pleading for a darling son!<br/>Poor pitied youth, by my paternal care,<br/>Rais'd up to all the heights his frame could bear:<br/>Had God ordain'd his fate for empire born,<br/>He would have giv'n his soul another turn:<br/>Gull'd with a patriot's name, whose modern sense<br/>Is one that would by law supplant his prince:<br/>The people's brave, the politician's tool;<br/>Never was patriot yet, but was a fool.<br/>Whence comes it that religion and the laws<br/>Should more be Absalom's than David's cause?<br/>His old instructor, e'er he lost his place,<br/>Was never thought endued with so much grace.<br/>Good heav'ns, how faction can a patriot paint!<br/>My rebel ever proves my people's saint;<br/>Would they impose an heir upon the throne?<br/>Let Sanhedrins be taught to give their own.<br/>A king's at least a part of government;<br/>And mine as requisite as their consent:<br/>Without my leave a future king to choose,<br/>Infers a right the present to depose;<br/>True, they petition me t'approve their choice:<br/>But Esau's hands suit ill with Jacob's voice.<br/>My pious subjects for my safety pray,<br/>Which to secure they take my pow'r away.<br/>From plots and treasons Heav'n preserve my years<br/>But save me most from my petitioners.<br/>Unsatiate as the barren womb or grave;<br/>God cannot grant so much as they can crave.<br/>What then is left but with a jealous eye<br/>To guard the small remains of royalty?<br/>The law shall still direct my peaceful sway,<br/>And the same law teach rebels to obey:<br/>Votes shall no more establish'd pow'r control,<br/>Such votes as make a part exceed the whole:<br/>No groundless clamours shall my friends remove,<br/>Nor crowds have pow'r to punish ere they prove:<br/>For gods, and god-like kings their care express,<br/>Still to defend their servants in distress.<br/>Oh that my pow'r to saving were confin'd:<br/>Why am I forc'd, like Heav'n, against my mind,<br/>To make examples of another kind?<br/>Must I at length the sword of justice draw?<br/>Oh curst effects of necessary law!<br/>How ill my fear they by my mercy scan,<br/>Beware the fury of a patient man.<br/>Law they require, let law then show her face;<br/>They could not be content to look on grace,<br/>Her hinder parts, but with a daring eye<br/>To tempt the terror of her front, and die.<br/>By their own arts 'tis righteously decreed,<br/>Those dire artificers of death shall bleed.<br/>Against themselves their witnesses will swear,<br/>Till viper-like their mother plot they tear:<br/>And suck for nutriment that bloody gore<br/>Which was their principle of life before.<br/>Their Belial with the Belzebub will fight;<br/>Thus on my foes, my foes shall do me right:<br/>Nor doubt th'event: for factious crowds engage<br/>In their first onset, all their brutal rage;<br/>Then, let 'em take an unresisted course:<br/>Retire and traverse, and delude their force:<br/>But when they stand all breathless, urge the fight,<br/>And rise upon 'em with redoubled might:<br/>For lawful pow'r is still superior found,<br/>When long driv'n back, at length it stands the ground.<br/><br/>He said. Th' Almighty, nodding, gave consent;<br/>And peals of thunder shook the firmament.<br/>Henceforth a series of new time began,<br/>The mighty years in long procession ran:<br/>Once more the god-like David was restor'd,<br/>And willing nations knew their lawful lord.
