# üíÆ The Alley. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    IMITATIONS OF ENGLISH POETS. SPENSER.<br/><br/>  In every town, where Thamis rolls his tyde,<br/>    A narrow pass there is, with houses low;<br/>  Where ever and anon the stream is eyed,<br/>    And many a boat soft sliding to and fro.<br/>    There oft are heard the notes of infant woe,<br/>  The short thick sob, loud scream, and shriller squall:<br/>    How can ye, mothers, vex your children so?<br/>  Some play, some eat, some cack against the wall,<br/>  And as they crouchen low, for bread and butter call.<br/><br/>  And on the broken pavement, here and there,<br/>    Doth many a stinking sprat and herring lie;<br/>  A brandy and tobacco shop is near,<br/>    And hens, and dogs, and hogs are feeding by;<br/>    And here a sailor's jacket hangs to dry.<br/>  At every door are sunburnt matrons seen,<br/>    Mending old nets to catch the scaly fry;<br/>  Now singing shrill, and scolding oft between;<br/>  Scolds answer foul-mouth'd scolds; bad neighbourhood, I ween.<br/><br/>  The snappish cur (the passenger's annoy)<br/>    Close at my heel with yelping treble flies;<br/>  The whimpering girl, and hoarser-screaming boy,<br/>    Join to the yelping treble shrilling cries;<br/>    The scolding quean to louder notes doth rise,<br/>  And her full pipes those shrilling cries confound;<br/>    To her full pipes the grunting hog replies;<br/>  The grunting hogs alarm the neighbours round,<br/>  And curs, girls, boys, and scolds, in the deep base are drown'd.<br/><br/>  Hard by a sty, beneath a roof of thatch,<br/>    Dwelt Obloquy, who in her early days<br/>  Baskets of fish at Billingsgate did watch,<br/>    Cod, whiting, oyster, mack'rel, sprat, or plaice:<br/>    There learn'd she speech from tongues that never cease.<br/>  Slander beside her, like a magpie, chatters,<br/>    With Envy (spitting cat!), dread foe to peace;<br/>  Like a cursed cur, Malice before her clatters,<br/>  And vexing every wight, tears clothes and all to tatters.<br/><br/>  Her dugs were mark'd by every collier's hand,<br/>    Her mouth was black as bull-dog's at the stall:<br/>  She scratch√®d, bit, and spared ne lace ne band,<br/>    And 'bitch' and 'rogue' her answer was to all;<br/>    Nay, even the parts of shame by name would call:<br/>  Yea, when she pass√®d by or lane or nook,<br/>    Would greet the man who turn'd him to the wall,<br/>  And by his hand obscene the porter took,<br/>  Nor ever did askance like modest virgin look.<br/><br/>  Such place hath Deptford, navy-building town,<br/>    Woolwich and Wapping, smelling strong of pitch;<br/>  Such Lambeth, envy of each band and gown,<br/>    And Twick'nam such, which fairer scenes enrich,<br/>    Grots, stutues, urns, and Jo--n's dog and bitch,<br/>  Ne village is without, on either side,<br/>    All up the silver Thames, or all adown;<br/>  Ne Richmond's self, from whose tall front are eyed<br/>  Vales, spires, meandering streams, and Windsor's towery pride.
