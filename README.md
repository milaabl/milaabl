<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Instans Tyrannus by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    Of the million or two, more or less,<br/>I rule and possess,<br/>One man, for some cause undefined,<br/>Was least to my mind.<br/><br/>I struck him, he grovelled of course--<br/>For, what was his force?<br/>I pinned him to earth with my weight<br/>And persistence of hate;<br/>And he lay, would not moan, would not curse,<br/>As his lot might be worse.<br/><br/>"Were the object less mean? would he stand<br/>At the swing of my hand!<br/>For obscurity helps him, and blots<br/>The hole where he squats."<br/>So, I set my five wits on the stretch.<br/>To inveigle the wretch.<br/>All in vain! Gold and jewels I threw,<br/>Still he couched there perdue;<br/>I tempted his blood and his flesh,<br/>Hid in roses my mesh,<br/>Choicest cates and the flagon's best spilth:<br/>Still he kept to his filth.<br/><br/>Had he kith now or kin, were access<br/>To his heart, did I press:<br/>Just a son or a mother to seize!<br/>No such booty as these.<br/>Were it simply a friend to pursue<br/>'Mid my million or two,<br/>Who could pay me, in person or pelf,<br/>What he owes me himself!<br/>No: I could not but smile thro' my chafe:<br/>For the fellow lay safe<br/>As his mates do, the midge and the nit,<br/>--Thro' minuteness, to wit.<br/><br/>Then a humour more great took its place<br/>At the thought of his face:<br/>The droop, the low cares of the mouth,<br/>The trouble uncouth<br/>'Twixt the brows, all that air one is fain<br/>To put out of its pain,<br/>And, "no!" I admonished myself,<br/>"Is one mocked by an elf.<br/>Is one baffled by toad or by rat?<br/>The gravamen's in that!<br/>How the lion, who crouches to suit<br/>His back to my foot,<br/>Would admire that I stand in debate!<br/>But the small turns the great<br/>If it vexes you,--that is the thing!<br/>Toad or rat vex the king?<br/>Tho' I waste half my realm to unearth<br/>Toad or rat, 'tis well worth!"<br/><br/>So, I soberly laid my last plan<br/>To extinguish the man.<br/>Round his creep-hole, with never a break<br/>Ran my fires for his sake;<br/>Overhead, did my thunder combine<br/>With my under-ground mine:<br/>Till I looked from my labour content<br/>To enjoy the event.<br/><br/>When sudden ... how think ye, the end?<br/>Did I say "without friend?"<br/>Say rather, from marge to blue marge<br/>The whole sky grew his targe<br/>With the sun's self for visible boss,<br/>While an Arm ran across<br/>Which the earth heaved beneath like a breast!<br/>Where the wretch was safe prest!<br/>Do you see! Just my vengeance complete,<br/>The man sprang to his feet,<br/>Stood erect, caught at God's skirts, and prayed!<br/>--So,I_ was afraid!
