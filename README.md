<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ On This Day I Complete My Thirty-Sixth Year by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    'T IS time this heart should be unmoved,<br/>  Since others it hath ceased to move:<br/>Yet, though I cannot be beloved,<br/>            Still let me love!<br/><br/>My days are in the yellow leaf;<br/>  The flowers and fruits of Love are gone;<br/>The worm, the canker, and the grief<br/>  Are mine alone!<br/><br/>The fire that on my bosom preys<br/>  Is lone as some Volcanic isle;<br/>No torch is kindled at its blaze--<br/>  A funeral pile.<br/><br/>The hope, the fear, the jealous care,<br/>  The exalted portion of the pain<br/>And power of love, I cannot share,<br/>  But wear the chain.<br/><br/>But 't is not _thus_--and 't is not _here_--<br/>  Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now<br/>Where Glory decks the hero's bier,<br/>  Or binds his brow.<br/><br/>The Sword, the Banner, and the Field,<br/>  Glory and Greece, around me see!<br/>The Spartan, borne upon his shield,<br/>  Was not more free.<br/><br/>Awake! (not Greece--she _is_ awake!)<br/>  Awake, my spirit! Think through _whom_<br/>Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,<br/>  And then strike home!<br/><br/>Tread those reviving passions down,<br/>  Unworthy manhood!--unto thee<br/>Indifferent should the smile or frown<br/>  Of Beauty be.<br/><br/>If thou regret'st thy youth, _why live_?<br/>  The land of honourable death<br/>Is here:--up to the Field, and give<br/>  Away thy breath!<br/><br/>Seek out--less often sought than found--<br/>  A soldier's grave, for thee the best;<br/>Then look around, and choose thy ground,<br/>  And take thy Rest.
</p>
