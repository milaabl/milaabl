# üíÆ The Heretic's Tragedy: A Middle-Age Interlude by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    The Lord, we look to once for all,<br/>        Is the Lord we should look at, all at once:<br/>He knows not to vary, saith Saint Paul,<br/>        Nor the shadow of turning, for the nonce.<br/>See him no other than as he is!<br/>        Give both the infinitudes their due--<br/>Infinite mercy, but, I wis,<br/>        As infinite a justice too.<br/><br/>As infinite a justice too.<br/><br/>John, Master of the Temple of God,<br/>        Falling to sin the Unknown Sin,<br/>What he bought of Emperor Aldabrod,<br/>        He sold it to Sultan Saladin:<br/>Till, caught by Pope Clement, a-buzzing there,<br/>        Hornet-prince of the mad wasps' hive,<br/>And clipt of his wings in Paris square,<br/>        They bring him now to be burned alive.<br/>                        [And wanteth there grace of lute or<br/>                                clavicithern, ye shall say to<br/>                                confirm him who singeth--<br/>        We bring John now to be burned alive.<br/><br/>In the midst is a goodly gallows built;<br/>        'Twixt fork and fork, a stake is stuck;<br/>But first they set divers tumbrils a-tilt,<br/>        Make a trench all round with the city muck;<br/>Inside they pile log upon log, good store;<br/>        Faggots no few, blocks great and small,<br/>Reach a man's mid-thigh, no less, no more,--<br/>        For they mean he should roast in the sight of all.<br/><br/>        We mean he should roast in the sight of all.<br/><br/>Good sappy bavins that kindle forthwith;<br/>        Billets that blaze substantial and slow;<br/>Pine-stump split deftly, dry as pith;<br/>        Larch-heart that chars to a chalk-white glow:<br/>They up they hoist me John in a chafe,<br/>        Sling him fast like a hog to scorch,<br/>Spit in his face, then leap back safe,<br/>Sing "Laudes" and bid clap-to the torch.<br/><br/>        Laus deo--who bids clap-to the torch.<br/><br/>John of the Temple, whose fame so bragged,<br/>        Is burning alive in Paris square!<br/>How can he curse, if his mouth is gagged?<br/>        Or wriggle his neck, with a collar there?<br/>Or heave his chest, which a band goes round?<br/>        Or threat with his fist, since his arms are spliced?<br/>Or kick with his feet, now his legs are bound?<br/>        --Thinks John, I will call upon Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ--John had bought and sold,<br/>        Jesus Christ--John had eaten and drunk;<br/>To him, the Flesh meant silver and gold.<br/>        (Salva reverentia.)<br/>Now it was, "Saviour, bountiful lamb,<br/>        "I have roasted thee Turks, though men roast me!<br/>"See thy servant, the plight wherein I am!<br/>        "Art thou a saviour? Save thou me!"<br/><br/>       'Tis John the mocker cries, "Save thou me!"<br/><br/>Who maketh God's menace an idle word?<br/>        --Saith, it no more means what it proclaims,<br/>Than a damsel's threat to her wanton bird?<br/>        For she too prattles of ugly names.<br/>--Saith, he knoweth but one thing--what he knows?<br/>        That God is good and the rest is breath;<br/>Why else is the same styled Sharon's rose?<br/>        Once a rose, ever a rose, he saith.<br/><br/>        O, John shall yet find a rose, he saith!<br/><br/>Alack, there be roses and roses, John!<br/>        Some, honied of taste like your leman's  tongue:<br/>Some, bitter; for why? (roast gaily on!)<br/>        Their tree struck root in devil's-dung.<br/>When Paul once reasoned of righteousness<br/>        And of temperance and of judgment to come,<br/>Good Felix trembled, he could no less:<br/>        John, snickering, crook'd his wicked thumb.<br/><br/>        What cometh to John of the wicked thumb?<br/><br/>Ha ha, John plucketh now at his rose<br/>        To rid himself of a sorrow at heart!<br/>Lo,--petal on petal, fierce rays unclose;<br/>        Anther on anther, sharp spikes outstart;<br/>And with blood for dew, the bosom boils;<br/>        And a gust of sulphur is all its smell;<br/>And lo, he is horribly in the toils<br/>        Of a coal-black giant flower of hell!<br/><br/>        What maketh heaven, That maketh hell.<br/><br/>So, as John called now, through the fire amain,<br/>        On the Name, he had cursed with, all his life--<br/>To the Person, he bought and sold again--<br/>        For the Face, with his daily buffets rife--<br/>Feature by feature It took its place:<br/>        And his voice, like a mad dog's choking bark,<br/>At the steady whole of the Judge's face--<br/>        Died. Forth John's soul flared into the dark.<br/><br/>        God help all poor souls lost in the dark!
