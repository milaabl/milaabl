# üíÆ June Dreams, In January by *Sidney Lanier*

<p>
    "So pulse, and pulse, thou rhythmic-hearted Noon<br/>That liest, large-limbed, curved along the hills,<br/>In languid palpitation, half a-swoon<br/>With ardors and sun-loves and subtle thrills;<br/><br/>"Throb, Beautiful! while the fervent hours exhale<br/>As kisses faint-blown from thy finger-tips<br/>Up to the sun, that turn him passion-pale<br/>And then as red as any virgin's lips.<br/><br/>"O tender Darkness, when June-day hath ceased,<br/>-- Faint Odor from the day-flower's crushing born,<br/>-- Dim, visible Sigh out of the mournful East<br/>That cannot see her lord again till morn:<br/><br/>"And many leaves, broad-palmed towards the sky<br/>To catch the sacred raining of star-light:<br/>And pallid petals, fain, all fain to die,<br/>Soul-stung by too keen passion of the night:<br/><br/>"And short-breath'd winds, under yon gracious moon<br/>Doing mild errands for mild violets,<br/>Or carrying sighs from the red lips of June<br/>What aimless way the odor-current sets:<br/><br/>"And stars, ringed glittering in whorls and bells,<br/>Or bent along the sky in looped star-sprays,<br/>Or vine-wound, with bright grapes in panicles,<br/>Or bramble-tangled in a sweetest maze,<br/><br/>"Or lying like young lilies in a lake<br/>About the great white Lotus of the moon,<br/>Or blown and drifted, as if winds should shake<br/>Star blossoms down from silver stems too soon,<br/><br/>"Or budding thick about full open stars,<br/>Or clambering shyly up cloud-lattices,<br/>Or trampled pale in the red path of Mars,<br/>Or trim-set in quaint gardener's fantasies:<br/><br/>"And long June night-sounds crooned among the leaves,<br/>And whispered confidence of dark and green,<br/>And murmurs in old moss about old eaves,<br/>And tinklings floating over water-sheen!"<br/><br/>Then he that wrote laid down his pen and sighed;<br/>And straightway came old Scorn and Bitterness,<br/>Like Hunnish kings out of the barbarous land,<br/>And camped upon the transient Italy<br/>That he had dreamed to blossom in his soul.<br/>"I'll date this dream," he said; "so: `Given, these,<br/>On this, the coldest night in all the year,<br/>From this, the meanest garret in the world,<br/>In this, the greatest city in the land,<br/>To you, the richest folk this side of death,<br/>By one, the hungriest poet under heaven,<br/>-- Writ while his candle sputtered in the gust,<br/>And while his last, last ember died of cold,<br/>And while the mortal ice i' the air made free<br/>Of all his bones and bit and shrunk his heart,<br/>And while soft Luxury made show to strike<br/>Her gloved hands together and to smile<br/>What time her weary feet unconsciously<br/>Trode wheels that lifted Avarice to power,<br/>-- And while, moreover, -- O thou God, thou God --<br/>His worshipful sweet wife sat still, afar,<br/>Within the village whence she sent him forth<br/>Into the town to make his name and fame,<br/>Waiting, all confident and proud and calm,<br/>Till he should make for her his name and fame,<br/>Waiting -- O Christ, how keen this cuts! -- large-eyed,<br/>With Baby Charley till her husband make<br/>For her and him a poet's name and fame.'<br/>-- Read me," he cried, and rose, and stamped his foot<br/>Impatiently at Heaven, "read me this,"<br/>(Putting th' inquiry full in the face of God)<br/>"Why can we poets dream us beauty, so,<br/>But cannot dream us bread? Why, now, can I<br/>Make, aye, create this fervid throbbing June<br/>Out of the chill, chill matter of my soul,<br/>Yet cannot make a poorest penny-loaf<br/>Out of this same chill matter, no, not one<br/>For Mary though she starved upon my breast?"<br/>And then he fell upon his couch, and sobbed,<br/>And, late, just when his heart leaned o'er<br/>The very edge of breaking, fain to fall,<br/>God sent him sleep.<br/>There came his room-fellow,<br/>Stout Dick, the painter, saw the written dream,<br/>Read, scratched his curly pate, smiled, winked, fell on<br/>The poem in big-hearted comic rage,<br/>Quick folded, thrust in envelope, addressed<br/>To him, the critic-god, that sitteth grim<br/>And giant-grisly on the stone causeway<br/>That leadeth to his magazine and fame.<br/>Him, by due mail, the little Dream of June<br/>Encountered growling, and at unawares<br/>Stole in upon his poem-battered soul<br/>So that he smiled, -- then shook his head upon 't<br/>-- Then growled, then smiled again, till at the last,<br/>As one that deadly sinned against his will,<br/>He writ upon the margin of the Dream<br/>A wondrous, wondrous word that in a day<br/>Did turn the fleeting song to very bread,<br/>-- Whereat Dick Painter leapt, the poet wept,<br/>And Mary slept with happy drops a-gleam<br/>Upon long lashes of her serene eyes<br/>From twentieth reading of her poet's news<br/>Quick-sent, "O sweet my Sweet, to dream is power,<br/>And I can dream thee bread and dream thee wine,<br/>And I will dream thee robes and gems, dear Love,<br/>To clothe thy holy loveliness withal,<br/>And I will dream thee here to live by me,<br/>Thee and my little man thou hold'st at breast,<br/>-- Come, Name, come, Fame, and kiss my Sweetheart's feet!"
