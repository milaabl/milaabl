# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Monk's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE<br/><br/>WHEN ended was my tale of Melibee,<br/>And of Prudence and her benignity,<br/>Our Hoste said, "As I am faithful man,<br/>And by the precious corpus Madrian,<br/>I had lever than a barrel of ale,<br/>That goode lefe my wife had heard this tale;<br/>For she is no thing of such patience<br/>As was this Meliboeus' wife Prudence.<br/>By Godde's bones! when I beat my knaves<br/>She bringeth me the greate clubbed staves,<br/>And crieth, 'Slay the dogges every one,<br/>And break of them both back and ev'ry bone.'<br/>And if that any neighebour of mine<br/>Will not in church unto my wife incline,<br/>Or be so hardy to her to trespace,<br/>When she comes home she rampeth in my face,<br/>And crieth, 'False coward, wreak thy wife<br/>By corpus Domini, I will have thy knife,<br/>And thou shalt have my distaff, and go spin.'<br/>From day till night right thus she will begin.<br/> 'Alas!' she saith, 'that ever I was shape<br/>To wed a milksop, or a coward ape,<br/>That will be overlad with every wight!<br/>Thou darest not stand by thy wife's right.'<br/><br/>"This is my life, but if that I will fight;<br/>And out at door anon I must me dight,<br/>Or elles I am lost, but if that I<br/>Be, like a wilde lion, fool-hardy.<br/>I wot well she will do me slay some day<br/>Some neighebour and thenne go my way;<br/>For I am perilous with knife in hand,<br/>Albeit that I dare not her withstand;<br/>For she is big in armes, by my faith!<br/>That shall he find, that her misdoth or saith.<br/>But let us pass away from this mattere.<br/>My lord the Monk," quoth he, "be merry of cheer,<br/>For ye shall tell a tale truely.<br/>Lo, Rochester stands here faste by.<br/>Ride forth, mine owen lord, break not our game.<br/>But by my troth I cannot tell your name;<br/>Whether shall I call you my lord Dan John,<br/>Or Dan Thomas, or elles Dan Albon?<br/>Of what house be ye, by your father's kin?<br/>I vow to God, thou hast a full fair skin;<br/>It is a gentle pasture where thou go'st;<br/>Thou art not like a penant or a ghost.<br/>Upon my faith thou art some officer,<br/>Some worthy sexton, or some cellarer.<br/>For by my father's soul, as to my dome,<br/>Thou art a master when thou art at home;<br/>No poore cloisterer, nor no novice,<br/>But a governor, both wily and wise,<br/>And therewithal, of brawnes and of bones,<br/>A right well-faring person for the nonce.<br/>I pray to God give him confusion<br/>That first thee brought into religion.<br/>Thou would'st have been a treade-fowl aright;<br/>Hadst thou as greate leave, as thou hast might,<br/>To perform all thy lust in engendrure,<br/>Thou hadst begotten many a creature.<br/>Alas! why wearest thou so wide a cope?<br/>God give me sorrow, but, an I were pope,<br/>Not only thou, but every mighty man,<br/>Though he were shorn full high upon his pan,<br/>Should have a wife; for all this world is lorn;<br/>Religion hath ta'en up all the corn<br/>Of treading, and we borel men be shrimps:<br/>Of feeble trees there come wretched imps.<br/>This maketh that our heires be so slender<br/>And feeble, that they may not well engender.<br/>This maketh that our wives will assay<br/>Religious folk, for they may better pay<br/>Of Venus' payementes than may we:<br/>God wot, no lusheburghes  paye ye.<br/>But be not wroth, my lord, though that I play;<br/>Full oft in game a sooth have I heard say."<br/><br/>This worthy Monk took all in patience,<br/>And said, "I will do all my diligence,<br/>As far as souneth unto honesty,<br/>To telle you a tale, or two or three.<br/>And if you list to hearken hitherward,<br/>I will you say the life of Saint Edward;<br/>Or elles first tragedies I will tell,<br/>Of which I have an hundred in my cell.<br/>Tragedy is to say a certain story,<br/>As olde bookes maken us memory,<br/>Of him that stood in great prosperity,<br/>And is y-fallen out of high degree<br/>In misery, and endeth wretchedly.<br/>And they be versified commonly<br/>Of six feet, which men call hexametron;<br/>In prose eke be indited many a one,<br/>And eke in metre, in many a sundry wise.<br/>Lo, this declaring ought enough suffice.<br/>Now hearken, if ye like for to hear.<br/>But first I you beseech in this mattere,<br/>Though I by order telle not these things,<br/>Be it of popes, emperors, or kings,<br/>After their ages, as men written find,<br/>But tell them some before and some behind,<br/>As it now cometh to my remembrance,<br/>Have me excused of mine ignorance."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>I will bewail, in manner of tragedy,<br/>The harm of them that stood in high degree,<br/>And felle so, that there was no remedy<br/>To bring them out of their adversity.<br/>For, certain, when that Fortune list to flee,<br/>There may no man the course of her wheel hold:<br/>Let no man trust in blind prosperity;<br/>Beware by these examples true and old.<br/><br/>At LUCIFER, though he an angel were,<br/>And not a man, at him I will begin.<br/>For though Fortune may no angel dere,<br/>From high degree yet fell he for his sin<br/>Down into hell, where as he yet is in.<br/>O Lucifer! brightest of angels all,<br/>Now art thou Satanas, that may'st not twin<br/>Out of the misery in which thou art fall.<br/><br/>Lo ADAM, in the field of Damascene<br/>With Godde's owen finger wrought was he,<br/>And not begotten of man's sperm unclean;<br/>And welt all Paradise saving one tree:<br/>Had never worldly man so high degree<br/>As Adam, till he for misgovernance<br/>Was driven out of his prosperity<br/>To labour, and to hell, and to mischance.<br/><br/>Lo SAMPSON, which that was annunciate<br/>By the angel, long ere his nativity;<br/>And was to God Almighty consecrate,<br/>And stood in nobless while that he might see;<br/>Was never such another as was he,<br/>To speak of strength, and thereto hardiness;<br/>But to his wives told he his secre,<br/>Through which he slew himself for wretchedness.<br/><br/>Sampson, this noble and mighty champion,<br/>Withoute weapon, save his handes tway,<br/>He slew and all to-rente the lion,<br/>Toward his wedding walking by the way.<br/>His false wife could him so please, and pray,<br/>Till she his counsel knew; and she, untrue,<br/>Unto his foes his counsel gan bewray,<br/>And him forsook, and took another new.<br/><br/>Three hundred foxes Sampson took for ire,<br/>And all their tailes he together band,<br/>And set the foxes' tailes all on fire,<br/>For he in every tail had knit a brand,<br/>And they burnt all the combs of that lend,<br/>And all their oliveres and vines eke.<br/>A thousand men he slew eke with his hand,<br/>And had no weapon but an ass's cheek.<br/><br/>When they were slain, so thirsted him, that he<br/>Was well-nigh lorn, for which he gan to pray<br/>That God would on his pain have some pity,<br/>And send him drink, or elles must he die;<br/>And of this ass's check, that was so dry,<br/>Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a well,<br/>Of which, he drank enough, shortly to say.<br/>Thus help'd him God, as Judicum   can tell.<br/><br/>By very force, at Gaza, on a night,<br/>Maugre the Philistines of that city,<br/>The gates of the town he hath up plight,<br/>And on his back y-carried them hath he<br/>High on an hill, where as men might them see.<br/>O noble mighty Sampson, lefe and dear,<br/>Hadst thou not told to women thy secre,<br/>In all this world there had not been thy peer.<br/><br/>This Sampson never cider drank nor wine,<br/>Nor on his head came razor none nor shear,<br/>By precept of the messenger divine;<br/>For all his strengthes in his haires were;<br/>And fully twenty winters, year by year,<br/>He had of Israel the governance;<br/>But soone shall he weepe many a tear,<br/>For women shall him bringe to mischance.<br/><br/>Unto his leman Dalila he told,<br/>That in his haires all his strengthe lay;<br/>And falsely to his foemen she him sold,<br/>And sleeping in her barme upon a day<br/>She made to clip or shear his hair away,<br/>And made his foemen all his craft espien.<br/>And when they founde him in this array,<br/>They bound him fast, and put out both his eyen.<br/><br/>But, ere his hair was clipped or y-shave,<br/>There was no bond with which men might him bind;<br/>But now is he in prison in a cave,<br/>Where as they made him at the querne grind.<br/>O noble Sampson, strongest of mankind!<br/>O whilom judge in glory and richess!<br/>Now may'st thou weepe with thine eyen blind,<br/>Since thou from weal art fall'n to wretchedness.<br/><br/>Th'end of this caitiff was as I shall say;<br/>His foemen made a feast upon a day,<br/>And made him as their fool before them play;<br/>And this was in a temple of great array.<br/>But at the last he made a foul affray,<br/>For he two pillars shook, and made them fall,<br/>And down fell temple and all, and there it lay,<br/>And slew himself and eke his foemen all;<br/><br/>This is to say, the princes every one;<br/>And eke three thousand bodies were there slain<br/>With falling of the great temple of stone.<br/>Of Sampson now will I no more sayn;<br/>Beware by this example old and plain,<br/>That no man tell his counsel to his wife<br/>Of such thing as he would have secret fain,<br/>If that it touch his limbes or his life.<br/><br/>Of HERCULES the sov'reign conquerour<br/>Singe his workes' land and high renown;<br/>For in his time of strength he bare the flow'r.<br/>He slew and reft the skin of the lion<br/>He of the Centaurs laid the boast adown;<br/>He Harpies  slew, the cruel birdes fell;<br/>He golden apples reft from the dragon<br/>He drew out Cerberus the hound of hell.<br/><br/>He slew the cruel tyrant Busirus.<br/>And made his horse to fret him flesh and bone;<br/>He slew the fiery serpent venomous;<br/>Of Achelous' two hornes brake he one.<br/>And he slew Cacus in a cave of stone;<br/>He slew the giant Antaeus the strong;<br/>He slew the grisly boar, and that anon;<br/>And bare the heav'n upon his necke long.<br/><br/>Was never wight, since that the world began,<br/>That slew so many monsters as did he;<br/>Throughout the wide world his name ran,<br/>What for his strength, and for his high bounte;<br/>And every realme went he for to see;<br/>He was so strong that no man might him let;<br/>At both the worlde's ends, as saith Trophee,<br/>Instead of boundes he a pillar set.<br/><br/>A leman had this noble champion,<br/>That highte Dejanira, fresh as May;<br/>And, as these clerkes make mention,<br/>She hath him sent a shirte fresh and gay;<br/>Alas! this shirt, alas and well-away!<br/>Envenomed was subtilly withal,<br/>That ere that he had worn it half a day,<br/>It made his flesh all from his bones fall.<br/><br/>But natheless some clerkes her excuse<br/>By one, that highte Nessus, that it maked;<br/>Be as he may, I will not her accuse;<br/>But on his back this shirt he wore all naked,<br/>Till that his flesh was for the venom blaked.<br/>And when he saw none other remedy,<br/>In hote coals he hath himselfe raked,<br/>For with no venom deigned he to die.<br/><br/>Thus sterf this worthy mighty Hercules.<br/>Lo, who may trust on Fortune any throw?<br/>For him that followeth all this world of pres,<br/>Ere he be ware, is often laid full low;<br/>Full wise is he that can himselfe know.<br/>Beware, for when that Fortune list to glose<br/>Then waiteth she her man to overthrow,<br/>By such a way as he would least suppose.<br/><br/>The mighty throne, the precious treasor,<br/>The glorious sceptre, and royal majesty,<br/>That had the king NABUCHODONOSOR<br/>With tongue unnethes may described be.<br/>He twice won Jerusalem the city,<br/>The vessels of the temple he with him lad;<br/>At Babylone was his sov'reign see,<br/>In which his glory and delight he had.<br/><br/>The fairest children of the blood royal<br/>Of Israel he did do geld anon,<br/>And maked each of them to be his thrall.<br/>Amonges others Daniel was one,<br/>That was the wisest child of every one;<br/>For he the dreames of the king expounded,<br/>Where in Chaldaea clerkes was there none<br/>That wiste to what fine his dreames sounded.<br/><br/>This proude king let make a statue of gold<br/>Sixty cubites long, and seven in bread',<br/>To which image hathe young and old<br/>Commanded he to lout, and have in dread,<br/>Or in a furnace, full of flames red,<br/>He should be burnt that woulde not obey:<br/>But never would assente to that deed<br/>Daniel, nor his younge fellows tway.<br/><br/>This king of kinges proud was and elate;<br/>He ween'd that God, that sits in majesty,<br/>Mighte him not bereave of his estate;<br/>But suddenly he lost his dignity,<br/>And like a beast he seemed for to be,<br/>And ate hay as an ox, and lay thereout<br/>In rain, with wilde beastes walked he,<br/>Till certain time was y-come about.<br/><br/>And like an eagle's feathers wax'd his hairs,<br/>His nailes like a birde's clawes were,<br/>Till God released him at certain years,<br/>And gave him wit; and then with many a tear<br/>He thanked God, and ever his life in fear<br/>Was he to do amiss, or more trespace:<br/>And till that time he laid was on his bier,<br/>He knew that God was full of might and grace.<br/><br/>His sone, which that highte BALTHASAR,<br/>That held the regne after his father's day,<br/>He by his father coulde not beware,<br/>For proud he was of heart and of array;<br/>And eke an idolaster was he aye.<br/>His high estate assured him in pride;<br/>But Fortune cast him down, and there he lay,<br/>And suddenly his regne gan divide.<br/><br/>A feast he made unto his lordes all<br/>Upon a time, and made them blithe be,<br/>And then his officeres gan he call;<br/>"Go, bringe forth the vessels," saide he,<br/>"Which that my father in his prosperity<br/>Out of the temple of Jerusalem reft,<br/>And to our highe goddes thanks we<br/>Of honour, that our elders with us left."<br/><br/>His wife, his lordes, and his concubines<br/>Aye dranke, while their appetites did last,<br/>Out of these noble vessels sundry wines.<br/>And on a wall this king his eyen cast,<br/>And saw an hand, armless, that wrote full fast;<br/>For fear of which he quaked, and sighed sore.<br/>This hand, that Balthasar so sore aghast,<br/>Wrote Mane, tekel, phares, and no more.<br/><br/>In all that land magician was there none<br/>That could expounde what this letter meant.<br/>But Daniel expounded it anon,<br/>And said, "O King, God to thy father lent<br/>Glory and honour, regne, treasure, rent;<br/>And he was proud, and nothing God he drad;<br/>And therefore God great wreche upon him sent,<br/>And him bereft the regne that he had.<br/><br/>"He was cast out of manne's company;<br/>With asses was his habitation<br/>And ate hay, as a beast, in wet and dry,<br/>Till that he knew by grace and by reason<br/>That God of heaven hath domination<br/>O'er every regne, and every creature;<br/>And then had God of him compassion,<br/>And him restor'd his regne and his figure.<br/><br/>"Eke thou, that art his son, art proud also,<br/>And knowest all these thinges verily;<br/>And art rebel to God, and art his foe.<br/>Thou drankest of his vessels boldely;<br/>Thy wife eke, and thy wenches, sinfully<br/>Drank of the same vessels sundry wines,<br/>And heried false goddes cursedly;<br/>Therefore to thee y-shapen full great pine is.<br/><br/>"This hand was sent from God, that on the wall<br/>Wrote Mane, tekel, phares, truste me;<br/>Thy reign is done; thou weighest naught at all;<br/>Divided is thy regne, and it shall be<br/>To Medes and to Persians giv'n," quoth he.<br/>And thilke same night this king was slaw<br/>And Darius occupied his degree,<br/>Though he thereto had neither right nor law.<br/><br/>Lordings, example hereby may ye take,<br/>How that in lordship is no sickerness;<br/>For when that Fortune will a man forsake,<br/>She bears away his regne and his richess,<br/>And eke his friendes bothe more and less,<br/>For what man that hath friendes through fortune,<br/>Mishap will make them enemies, I guess;<br/>This proverb is full sooth, and full commune.<br/><br/>ZENOBIA, of Palmyrie the queen,<br/>As write Persians of her nobless,<br/>So worthy was in armes, and so keen,<br/>That no wight passed her in hardiness,<br/>Nor in lineage, nor other gentleness.<br/>Of the king's blood of Perse is she descended;<br/>I say not that she hadde most fairness,<br/>But of her shape she might not he amended.<br/><br/>From her childhood I finde that she fled<br/>Office of woman, and to woods she went,<br/>And many a wilde harte's blood she shed<br/>With arrows broad that she against them sent;<br/>She was so swift, that she anon them hent.<br/>And when that she was older, she would kill<br/>Lions, leopards, and beares all to-rent,<br/>And in her armes wield them at her will.<br/><br/>She durst the wilde beastes' dennes seek,<br/>And runnen in the mountains all the night,<br/>And sleep under a bush; and she could eke<br/>Wrestle by very force and very might<br/>With any young man, were he ne'er so wight;<br/>There mighte nothing in her armes stond.<br/>She kept her maidenhood from every wight,<br/>To no man deigned she for to be bond.<br/><br/>But at the last her friendes have her married<br/>To Odenate,  a prince of that country;<br/>All were it so, that she them longe tarried.<br/>And ye shall understande how that he<br/>Hadde such fantasies as hadde she;<br/>But natheless, when they were knit in fere,<br/>They liv'd in joy, and in felicity,<br/>For each of them had other lefe and dear.<br/><br/>Save one thing, that she never would assent,<br/>By no way, that he shoulde by her lie<br/>But ones, for it was her plain intent<br/>To have a child, the world to multiply;<br/>And all so soon as that she might espy<br/>That she was not with childe by that deed,<br/>Then would she suffer him do his fantasy<br/>Eftsoon, and not but ones, out of dread.<br/><br/>And if she were with child at thilke cast,<br/>No more should he playe thilke game<br/>Till fully forty dayes were past;<br/>Then would she once suffer him do the same.<br/>All were this Odenatus wild or tame,<br/>He got no more of her; for thus she said,<br/>It was to wives lechery and shame<br/>In other case if that men with them play'd.<br/><br/>Two sones, by this Odenate had she,<br/>The which she kept in virtue and lettrure.<br/>But now unto our tale turne we;<br/>I say, so worshipful a creature,<br/>And wise therewith, and large with measure,<br/>So penible in the war, and courteous eke,<br/>Nor more labour might in war endure,<br/>Was none, though all this worlde men should seek.<br/><br/>Her rich array it mighte not be told,<br/>As well in vessel as in her clothing:<br/>She was all clad in pierrie and in gold,<br/>And eke she lefte not, for no hunting,<br/>To have of sundry tongues full knowing,<br/>When that she leisure had, and for t'intend<br/>To learne bookes was all her liking,<br/>How she in virtue might her life dispend.<br/><br/>And, shortly of this story for to treat,<br/>So doughty was her husband and eke she,<br/>That they conquered many regnes great<br/>In th'Orient, with many a fair city<br/>Appertinent unto the majesty<br/>Of Rome, and with strong hande held them fast,<br/>Nor ever might their foemen do them flee,<br/>Aye while that Odenatus' dayes last'.<br/><br/>Her battles, whoso list them for to read,<br/>Against Sapor the king,  and other mo',<br/>And how that all this process fell in deed,<br/>Why she conquer'd, and what title thereto,<br/>And after of her mischief and her woe,<br/>How that she was besieged and y-take,<br/>Let him unto my master Petrarch go,<br/>That writes enough of this, I undertake.<br/><br/>When Odenate was dead, she mightily<br/>The regne held, and with her proper hand<br/>Against her foes she fought so cruelly,<br/>That there n'as king nor prince in all that land,<br/>That was not glad, if be that grace fand<br/>That she would not upon his land warray;<br/>With her they maden alliance by bond,<br/>To be in peace, and let her ride and play.<br/><br/>The emperor of Rome, Claudius,<br/>Nor, him before, the Roman Gallien,<br/>Durste never be so courageous,<br/>Nor no Armenian, nor Egyptien,<br/>Nor Syrian, nor no Arabien,<br/>Within the fielde durste with her fight,<br/>Lest that she would them with her handes slen,<br/>Or with her meinie putte them to flight.<br/><br/>In kinges' habit went her sones two,<br/>As heires of their father's regnes all;<br/>And Heremanno and Timolao<br/>Their names were, as Persians them call<br/>But aye Fortune hath in her honey gall;<br/>This mighty queene may no while endure;<br/>Fortune out of her regne made her fall<br/>To wretchedness and to misadventure.<br/><br/>Aurelian, when that the governance<br/>Of Rome came into his handes tway,<br/>He shope upon this queen to do vengeance;<br/>And with his legions he took his way<br/>Toward Zenobie, and, shortly for to say,<br/>He made her flee, and at the last her hent,<br/>And fetter'd her, and eke her children tway,<br/>And won the land, and home to Rome he went.<br/><br/>Amonges other thinges that he wan,<br/>Her car, that was with gold wrought and pierrie,<br/>This greate Roman, this Aurelian<br/>Hath with him led, for that men should it see.<br/>Before in his triumphe walked she<br/>With gilte chains upon her neck hanging;<br/>Crowned she was, as after her degree,<br/>And full of pierrie her clothing.<br/><br/>Alas, Fortune! she that whilom was<br/>Dreadful to kinges and to emperours,<br/>Now galeth all the people on her, alas!<br/>And she that helmed was in starke stowres,<br/>And won by force townes strong and tow'rs,<br/>Shall on her head now wear a vitremite;<br/>And she that bare the sceptre full of flow'rs<br/>Shall bear a distaff, her cost for to quite.<br/><br/>Although that NERO were so vicious<br/>As any fiend that lies full low adown,<br/>Yet he, as telleth us Suetonius,<br/>This wide world had in subjectioun,<br/>Both East and West, South and Septentrioun.<br/>Of rubies, sapphires, and of pearles white<br/>Were all his clothes embroider'd up and down,<br/>For he in gemmes greatly gan delight.<br/><br/>More delicate, more pompous of array,<br/>More proud, was never emperor than he;<br/>That ilke cloth that he had worn one day,<br/>After that time he would it never see;<br/>Nettes of gold thread had he great plenty,<br/>To fish in Tiber, when him list to play;<br/>His lustes were as law, in his degree,<br/>For Fortune as his friend would him obey.<br/><br/>He Rome burnt for his delicacy;<br/>The senators he slew upon a day,<br/>To heare how that men would weep and cry;<br/>And slew his brother, and by his sister lay.<br/>His mother made he in piteous array;<br/>For he her wombe slitte, to behold<br/>Where he conceived was; so well-away!<br/>That he so little of his mother told.<br/><br/>No tear out of his eyen for that sight<br/>Came; but he said, a fair woman was she.<br/>Great wonder is, how that he could or might<br/>Be doomesman of her deade beauty:<br/>The wine to bringe him commanded he,<br/>And drank anon; none other woe he made,<br/>When might is joined unto cruelty,<br/>Alas! too deepe will the venom wade.<br/><br/>In youth a master had this emperour,<br/>To teache him lettrure and courtesy;<br/>For of morality he was the flow'r,<br/>As in his time, but if bookes lie.<br/>And while this master had of him mast'ry,<br/>He made him so conning and so souple,<br/>That longe time it was ere tyranny,<br/>Or any vice, durst in him uncouple.<br/><br/>This Seneca, of which that I devise,<br/>Because Nero had of him suche dread,<br/>For he from vices would him aye chastise<br/>Discreetly, as by word, and not by deed;<br/>"Sir," he would say, "an emperor must need<br/>Be virtuous, and hate tyranny."<br/>For which he made him in a bath to bleed<br/>On both his armes, till he muste die.<br/><br/>This Nero had eke of a custumance<br/>In youth against his master for to rise;<br/>Which afterward he thought a great grievance;<br/>Therefore he made him dien in this wise.<br/>But natheless this Seneca the wise<br/>Chose in a bath to die in this mannere,<br/>Rather than have another tormentise;<br/>And thus hath Nero slain his master dear.<br/><br/>Now fell it so, that Fortune list no longer<br/>The highe pride of Nero to cherice;<br/>For though he were strong, yet was she stronger.<br/>She thoughte thus; "By God, I am too nice<br/>To set a man, that is full fill'd of vice,<br/>In high degree, and emperor him call!<br/>By God, out of his seat I will him trice!<br/>When he least weeneth, soonest shall he fall."<br/><br/>The people rose upon him on a night,<br/>For  his default; and when he it espied,<br/>Out of his doors anon he hath him dight<br/>Alone, and where he ween'd t'have been allied,<br/>He knocked fast, and aye the more he cried<br/>The faster shutte they their doores all;<br/>Then wist he well he had himself misgied,<br/>And went his way, no longer durst he call.<br/><br/>The people cried and rumbled up and down,<br/>That with his eares heard he how they said;<br/>"Where is this false tyrant, this Neroun?"<br/>For fear almost out of his wit he braid,<br/>And to his goddes piteously he pray'd<br/>For succour, but it mighte not betide<br/>For dread of this he thoughte that died,<br/>And ran into a garden him to hide.<br/><br/>And in this garden found he churles tway,<br/>That satte by a fire great and red;<br/>And to these churles two he gan to pray<br/>To slay him, and to girdon off his head,<br/>That to his body, when that he were dead,<br/>Were no despite done for his defame.<br/>Himself he slew, he coud no better rede;<br/>Of which Fortune laugh'd and hadde game.<br/><br/>Was never capitain under a king,<br/>That regnes more put in subjectioun,<br/>Nor stronger was in field of alle thing<br/>As in his time, nor greater of renown,<br/>Nor more pompous in high presumptioun,<br/>Than HOLOFERNES, whom Fortune aye kiss'd<br/>So lik'rously, and led him up and down,<br/>Till that his head was off ere that he wist.<br/><br/>Not only that this world had of him awe,<br/>For losing of richess and liberty;<br/>But he made every man reny his law.<br/>Nabuchodonosor was God, said he;<br/>None other Godde should honoured be.<br/>Against his hest there dare no wight trespace,<br/>Save in Bethulia, a strong city,<br/>Where Eliachim priest was of that place.<br/><br/>But take keep of the death of Holofern;<br/>Amid his host he drunken lay at night<br/>Within his tente, large as is a bern;<br/>And yet, for all his pomp and all his might,<br/>Judith, a woman, as he lay upright<br/>Sleeping, his head off smote, and from his tent<br/>Full privily she stole from every wight,<br/>And with his head unto her town she went.<br/><br/>What needeth it of king ANTIOCHUS<br/>To tell his high and royal majesty,<br/>His great pride, and his workes venomous?<br/>For such another was there none as he;<br/>Reade what that he was in Maccabee.<br/>And read the proude wordes that he said,<br/>And why he fell from his prosperity,<br/>And in an hill how wretchedly he died.<br/><br/>Fortune him had enhanced so in pride,<br/>That verily he ween'd he might attain<br/>Unto the starres upon every side,<br/>And in a balance weighen each mountain,<br/>And all the floodes of the sea restrain.<br/>And Godde's people had he most in hate<br/>Them would he slay in torment and in pain,<br/>Weening that God might not his pride abate.<br/><br/>And for that Nicanor and Timothee<br/>With Jewes were vanquish'd mightily,<br/>Unto the Jewes such an hate had he,<br/>That he bade graith his car full hastily,<br/>And swore and saide full dispiteously,<br/>Unto Jerusalem he would eftsoon,<br/>To wreak his ire on it full cruelly<br/>But of his purpose was he let full soon.<br/><br/>God for his menace him so sore smote,<br/>With invisible wound incurable,<br/>That in his guttes carf it so and bote,<br/>Till that his paines were importable;<br/>And certainly the wreche was reasonable,<br/>For many a manne's guttes did he pain;<br/>But from his purpose, curs'd and damnable,<br/>For all his smart he would him not restrain;<br/>But bade anon apparaile his host.<br/><br/>And suddenly, ere he was of it ware,<br/>God daunted all his pride, and all his boast<br/>For he so sore fell out of his chare,<br/>That it his limbes and his skin to-tare,<br/>So that he neither mighte go nor ride<br/>But in a chaire men about him bare,<br/>Alle forbruised bothe back and side.<br/><br/>The wreche of God him smote so cruelly,<br/>That through his body wicked wormes crept,<br/>And therewithal he stank so horribly<br/>That none of all his meinie that him kept,<br/>Whether so that he woke or elles slept,<br/>Ne mighte not of him the stink endure.<br/>In this mischief he wailed and eke wept,<br/>And knew God Lord of every creature.<br/><br/>To all his host, and to himself also,<br/>Full wlatsem was the stink of his carrain;<br/>No manne might him beare to and fro.<br/>And in this stink, and this horrible pain,<br/>He starf full wretchedly in a mountain.<br/>Thus hath this robber, and this homicide,<br/>That many a manne made to weep and plain,<br/>Such guerdon as belongeth unto pride.<br/><br/>The story of ALEXANDER is so commune,<br/>That ev'ry wight that hath discretion<br/>Hath heard somewhat or all of his fortune.<br/>This wide world, as in conclusion,<br/>He won by strength; or, for his high renown,<br/>They were glad for peace to him to send.<br/>The pride and boast of man he laid adown,<br/>Whereso he came, unto the worlde's end.<br/><br/>Comparison yet never might be maked<br/>Between him and another conqueror;<br/>For all this world for dread of him had quaked<br/>He was of knighthood and of freedom flow'r:<br/>Fortune him made the heir of her honour.<br/>Save wine and women, nothing might assuage<br/>His high intent in arms and labour,<br/>So was he full of leonine courage.<br/><br/>What praise were it to him, though I you told<br/>Of Darius, and a hundred thousand mo',<br/>Of kinges, princes, dukes, and earles bold,<br/>Which he conquer'd, and brought them into woe?<br/>I say, as far as man may ride or go,<br/>The world was his, why should I more devise?<br/>For, though I wrote or told you evermo',<br/>Of his knighthood it mighte not suffice.<br/><br/>Twelve years he reigned, as saith Maccabee<br/>Philippe's son of Macedon he was,<br/>That first was king in Greece the country.<br/>O worthy gentle Alexander, alas<br/>That ever should thee falle such a case!<br/>Empoison'd of thine owen folk thou were;<br/>Thy six  fortune hath turn'd into an ace,<br/>And yet for thee she wepte never a tear.<br/><br/>Who shall me give teares to complain<br/>The death of gentiless, and of franchise,<br/>That all this worlde had in his demaine,<br/>And yet he thought it mighte not suffice,<br/>So full was his corage of high emprise?<br/>Alas! who shall me helpe to indite<br/>False Fortune, and poison to despise?<br/>The whiche two of all this woe I wite.<br/><br/>By wisdom, manhood, and by great labour,<br/>From humbleness to royal majesty<br/>Up rose he, JULIUS the Conquerour,<br/>That won all th' Occident, by land and sea,<br/>By strength of hand or elles by treaty,<br/>And unto Rome made them tributary;<br/>And since of Rome the emperor was he,<br/>Till that Fortune wax'd his adversary.<br/><br/>O mighty Caesar, that in Thessaly<br/>Against POMPEIUS, father thine in law,<br/>That of th' Orient had all the chivalry,<br/>As far as that the day begins to daw,<br/>That through thy knighthood hast them take and slaw,<br/>Save fewe folk that with Pompeius fled;<br/>Through which thou put all th' Orient in awe;<br/>Thanke Fortune that so well thee sped.<br/><br/>But now a little while I will bewail<br/>This Pompeius, this noble governor<br/>Of Rome, which that fled at this battaile<br/>I say, one of his men, a false traitor,<br/>His head off smote, to winne him favor<br/>Of Julius, and him the head he brought;<br/>Alas! Pompey, of th' Orient conqueror,<br/>That Fortune unto such a fine thee brought!<br/><br/>To Rome again repaired Julius,<br/>With his triumphe laureate full high;<br/>But on a time Brutus and Cassius,<br/>That ever had of his estate envy,<br/>Full privily have made conspiracy<br/>Against this Julius in subtle wise<br/>And cast the place in which he shoulde die,<br/>With bodekins, as I shall you devise.<br/><br/>This Julius to the Capitole went<br/>Upon a day, as he was wont to gon;<br/>And in the Capitol anon him hent<br/>This false Brutus, and his other fone,<br/>And sticked him with bodekins anon<br/>With many a wound, and thus they let him lie.<br/>But never groan'd he at no stroke but one,<br/>Or else at two, but if the story lie.<br/><br/>So manly was this Julius of heart,<br/>And so well loved estately honesty<br/>That, though his deadly woundes sore smart,<br/>His mantle o'er his hippes caste he,<br/>That ne man shoulde see his privity<br/>And as he lay a-dying in a trance,<br/>And wiste verily that dead was he,<br/>Of honesty yet had he remembrance.<br/><br/>Lucan, to thee this story I recommend,<br/>And to Sueton', and Valerie also,<br/>That of this story write word and end<br/>How that to these great conquerores two<br/>Fortune was first a friend, and since a foe.<br/>No manne trust upon her favour long,<br/>But have her in await for evermo';<br/>Witness on all these conquerores strong.<br/><br/>The riche CROESUS,  whilom king of Lyde, --<br/>Of which Croesus Cyrus him sore drad, --<br/>Yet was he caught amiddes all his pride,<br/>And to be burnt men to the fire him lad;<br/>But such a rain down from the welkin shad,<br/>That slew the fire, and made him to escape:<br/>But to beware no grace yet he had,<br/>Till fortune on the gallows made him gape.<br/><br/>When he escaped was, he could not stint<br/>For to begin a newe war again;<br/>He weened well, for that Fortune him sent<br/>Such hap, that he escaped through the rain,<br/>That of his foes he mighte not be slain.<br/>And eke a sweven on a night he mette,<br/>Of which he was so proud, and eke so fain,<br/>That he in vengeance all his hearte set.<br/><br/>Upon a tree he was set, as he thought,<br/>Where Jupiter him wash'd, both back and side,<br/>And Phoebus eke a fair towel him brought<br/>To dry him with; and therefore wax'd his pride.<br/>And to his daughter that stood him beside,<br/>Which he knew in high science to abound,<br/>He bade her tell him what it signified;<br/>And she his dream began right thus expound.<br/><br/>"The tree," quoth she, "the gallows is to mean,<br/>And Jupiter betokens snow and rain,<br/>And Phoebus, with his towel clear and clean,<br/>These be the sunne's streames sooth to sayn;<br/>Thou shalt y-hangeth be, father, certain;<br/>Rain shall thee wash, and sunne shall thee dry."<br/>Thus warned him full plat and eke full plain<br/>His daughter, which that called was Phanie.<br/><br/>And hanged was Croesus the proude king;<br/>His royal throne might him not avail.<br/>Tragedy is none other manner thing,<br/>Nor can in singing crien nor bewail,<br/>But for that Fortune all day will assail<br/>With unware stroke the regnes that be proud:<br/>For when men truste her, then will she fail,<br/>And cover her bright face with a cloud.<br/><br/>O noble, O worthy PEDRO,  glory OF SPAIN,<br/>Whem Fortune held so high in majesty,<br/>Well oughte men thy piteous death complain.<br/>Out of thy land thy brother made thee flee,<br/>And after, at a siege, by subtlety,<br/>Thou wert betray'd, and led unto his tent,<br/>Where as he with his owen hand slew thee,<br/>Succeeding in thy regne and in thy rent.<br/><br/>The field of snow, with th' eagle of black therein,<br/>Caught with the lion, red-colour'd as the glede,<br/>He brew'd this cursedness, and all this sin;<br/>The wicked nest was worker of this deed;<br/>Not Charles' Oliver,  that took aye heed<br/>Of truth and honour, but of Armorike<br/>Ganilien Oliver, corrupt for meed,<br/>Broughte this worthy king in such a brike.<br/><br/>O worthy PETRO, King of CYPRE  also,<br/>That Alexandre won by high mast'ry,<br/>Full many a heathnen wroughtest thou full woe,<br/>Of which thine owen lieges had envy;<br/>And, for no thing but for thy chivalry,<br/>They in thy bed have slain thee by the morrow;<br/>Thus can Fortune her wheel govern and gie,<br/>And out of joy bringe men into sorrow.<br/><br/>Of Milan greate BARNABO VISCOUNT,<br/>God of delight, and scourge of Lombardy,<br/>Why should I not thine clomben wert so high?<br/>Thy brother's son, that was thy double ally,<br/>For he thy nephew was and son-in-law,<br/>Within his prison made thee to die,<br/>But why, nor how, n'ot I that thou were slaw.<br/><br/>Of th' Earl HUGOLIN OF PISE the languour<br/>There may no tongue telle for pity.<br/>But little out of Pisa stands a tow'r,<br/>In whiche tow'r in prison put was he,<br/>Aud with him be his little children three;<br/>The eldest scarcely five years was of age;<br/>Alas! Fortune, it was great cruelty<br/>Such birdes for to put in such a cage.<br/><br/>Damned was he to die in that prison;<br/>For Roger, which that bishop was of Pise,<br/>Had on him made a false suggestion,<br/>Through which the people gan upon him rise,<br/>And put him in prison, in such a wise<br/>As ye have heard; and meat and drink he had<br/>So small, that well unneth it might suffice,<br/>And therewithal it was full poor and bad.<br/><br/>And on a day befell, that in that hour<br/>When that his meate wont was to be brought,<br/>The jailor shut the doores of the tow'r;<br/>He heard it right well, but he spake nought.<br/>And in his heart anon there fell a thought,<br/>That they for hunger woulde do him dien;<br/>"Alas!" quoth he, "alas that I was wrought!"<br/>Therewith the teares fell from his eyen.<br/><br/>His youngest son, that three years was of age,<br/>Unto him said, "Father, why do ye weep?<br/>When will the jailor bringen our pottage?<br/>Is there no morsel bread that ye do keep?<br/>I am so hungry, that I may not sleep.<br/>Now woulde God that I might sleepen ever!<br/>Then should not hunger in my wombe creep;<br/>There is no thing, save bread, that one were lever."<br/><br/>Thus day by day this child begun to cry,<br/>Till in his father's barme adown he lay,<br/>And saide, "Farewell, father, I must die;"<br/>And kiss'd his father, and died the same day.<br/>And when the woeful father did it sey,<br/>For woe his armes two he gan to bite,<br/>And said, "Alas! Fortune, and well-away!<br/>To thy false wheel my woe all may I wite."<br/><br/>His children ween'd that it for hunger was<br/>That he his armes gnaw'd, and not for woe,<br/>And saide, "Father, do not so, alas!<br/>But rather eat the flesh upon us two.<br/>Our flesh thou gave us, our flesh take us fro',<br/>And eat enough;" right thus they to him said.<br/>And after that, within a day or two,<br/>They laid them in his lap adown, and died.<br/><br/>Himself, despaired, eke for hunger starf.<br/>Thus ended is this Earl of Pise;<br/>From high estate Fortune away him carf.<br/>Of this tragedy it ought enough suffice<br/>Whoso will hear it in a longer wise,<br/>Reade the greate poet of ltale,<br/>That Dante hight, for he can it devise<br/>From point to point, not one word will he fail.
