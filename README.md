  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ I Sing the Body Electric. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    1<br/>I SING the Body electric;<br/>The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;<br/>They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,<br/>And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul.<br/><br/>Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves;<br/>And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?<br/>And if the body does not do as much as the Soul?<br/>And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?<br/><br/>2<br/>The love of the Body of man or woman balks account‚Äîthe body itself balks account;<br/>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.<br/><br/>The expression of the face balks account;<br/>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;<br/>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists;<br/><br/>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees‚Äîdress does<br/>  not hide him;<br/>The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel;<br/>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;<br/>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.<br/><br/>The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress,<br/>  their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,<br/>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent<br/>  green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the<br/>  water,<br/>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats‚Äîthe horseman in his saddle,<br/>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,<br/>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives<br/>  waiting,<br/>The female soothing a child‚Äîthe farmer‚Äôs daughter in the garden or cow-yard,<br/>The young fellow hoeing corn‚Äîthe sleigh-driver guiding his six horses through the crowd,<br/><br/>The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured,<br/>  native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown, after work,<br/>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,<br/>The upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;<br/>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through<br/>  clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,<br/>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the<br/>  listening on the alert,<br/>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes‚Äîthe bent head, the curv‚Äôd neck, and the<br/>  counting;<br/>Such-like I love‚ÄîI loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother‚Äôs breast with the<br/>  little child,<br/>Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause,<br/>  listen, and count.<br/><br/>3<br/>I know a man, a common farmer‚Äîthe father of five sons;<br/>And in them were the fathers of sons‚Äîand in them were the fathers of sons.<br/><br/>This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person;<br/>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the<br/>  immeasurable meaning of his black eyes‚Äîthe richness and breadth of his manners,<br/>These I used to go and visit him to see‚Äîhe was wise also;<br/>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old‚Äîhis sons were massive, clean,<br/>  bearded, tan-faced, handsome;<br/>They and his daughters loved him‚Äîall who saw him loved him;<br/>They did not love him by allowance‚Äîthey loved him with personal love;<br/>He drank water only‚Äîthe blood show‚Äôd like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his<br/>  face;<br/>He was a frequent gunner and fisher‚Äîhe sail‚Äôd his boat himself‚Äîhe had a fine one<br/>  presented to him by a ship-joiner‚Äîhe had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that<br/>  loved him;<br/>When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him<br/>  out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang.<br/><br/>You would wish long and long to be with him‚Äîyou would wish to sit by him in the boat,<br/>  that you and he might touch each other.<br/><br/>4<br/>I have perceiv‚Äôd that to be with those I like is enough,<br/>To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,<br/>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,<br/>To pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck<br/>  for a moment‚Äîwhat is this, then?<br/>I do not ask any more delight‚ÄîI swim in it, as in a sea.<br/><br/>There is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the<br/>  contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well;<br/>All things please the soul‚Äîbut these please the soul well.<br/><br/>5<br/>This is the female form;<br/>A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;<br/>It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!<br/>I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor‚Äîall falls aside but<br/>  myself and it;<br/>Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds,<br/>  and what was expected of heaven or fear‚Äôd of hell, are now consumed;<br/>Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it‚Äîthe response likewise ungovernable;<br/>Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused‚Äîmine too<br/>  diffused;<br/>Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb‚Äîlove-flesh swelling and deliciously<br/>  aching;<br/>Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and<br/>  delirious juice;<br/>Bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn;<br/>Undulating into the willing and yielding day,<br/>Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh‚Äôd day.<br/><br/>This is the nucleus‚Äîafter the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman;<br/>This is the bath of birth‚Äîthis is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.<br/><br/>Be not ashamed, women‚Äîyour privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest;<br/>You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.<br/><br/>The female contains all qualities, and tempers them‚Äîshe is in her place, and moves with<br/>  perfect balance;<br/>She is all things duly veil‚Äôd‚Äîshe is both passive and active;<br/>She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.<br/><br/>As I see my soul reflected in nature;<br/>As I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty,<br/>See the bent head, and arms folded over the breast‚Äîthe female I see.<br/><br/>6<br/>The male is not less the soul, nor more‚Äîhe too is in his place;<br/>He too is all qualities‚Äîhe is action and power;<br/>The flush of the known universe is in him;<br/>Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well;<br/>The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him<br/>  well‚Äîpride is for him;<br/>The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;<br/>Knowledge becomes him‚Äîhe likes it always‚Äîhe brings everything to the test of himself;<br/>Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only<br/>  here;<br/>(Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)<br/><br/>The man‚Äôs body is sacred, and the woman‚Äôs body is sacred;<br/>No matter who it is, it is sacred;<br/>Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?<br/>Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well-off‚Äîjust as much as you;<br/>Each has his or her place in the procession.<br/><br/>(All is a procession;<br/>The universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion.)<br/><br/>Do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull-face ignorant?<br/>Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?<br/>Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float‚Äîand the soil is on the<br/>  surface, and water runs, and vegetation sprouts,<br/>For you only, and not for him and her?<br/><br/>7<br/>A man‚Äôs Body at auction;<br/>I help the auctioneer‚Äîthe sloven does not half know his business.<br/><br/>Gentlemen, look on this wonder!<br/>Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it;<br/>For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one animal or plant;<br/>For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll‚Äôd.<br/><br/>In this head the all-baffling brain;<br/>In it and below it, the makings of heroes.<br/><br/>Examine these limbs, red, black, or white‚Äîthey are so cunning in tendon and nerve;<br/>They shall be stript, that you may see them.<br/><br/>Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,<br/>Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and<br/>  legs,<br/>And wonders within there yet.<br/><br/>Within there runs blood,<br/>The same old blood!<br/>The same red-running blood!<br/>There swells and jets a heart‚Äîthere all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations;<br/>Do you think they are not there because they are not express‚Äôd in parlors and<br/>  lecture-rooms?<br/><br/>This is not only one man‚Äîthis is the father of those who shall be fathers in their<br/>  turns;<br/>In him the start of populous states and rich republics;<br/>Of him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and enjoyments.<br/><br/>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?<br/>Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the<br/>  centuries?<br/><br/>8<br/>A woman‚Äôs Body at auction!<br/>She too is not only herself‚Äîshe is the teeming mother of mothers;<br/>She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.<br/><br/>Have you ever loved the Body of a woman?<br/>Have you ever loved the Body of a man?<br/>Your father‚Äîwhere is your father?<br/>Your mother‚Äîis she living? have you been much with her? and has she been much with you?<br/><br/>‚ÄîDo you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all nations and times, all<br/>  over the earth?<br/><br/>If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,<br/>And the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted;<br/>And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful as the most beautiful<br/>  face.<br/><br/>Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her<br/>  own live body?<br/>For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.<br/><br/>9<br/>O my Body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the<br/>  parts of you;<br/>I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the Soul, (and that they<br/>  are the Soul;)<br/>I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems‚Äîand that they are poems,<br/>Man‚Äôs, woman‚Äôs, child‚Äôs, youth‚Äôs, wife‚Äôs, husband‚Äôs, mother‚Äôs, father‚Äôs,<br/>  young man‚Äôs, young woman‚Äôs poems;<br/>Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,<br/>Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids,<br/>Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges,<br/>Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,<br/>Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue,<br/>Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the<br/>  chest.<br/><br/>Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones,<br/>Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, finger-balls,<br/>  finger-joints, finger-nails,<br/>Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side,<br/>Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone,<br/>Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root,<br/>Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,<br/>Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under leg,<br/>Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;<br/>All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body, or of any<br/>  one‚Äôs body, male or female,<br/>The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,<br/>The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,<br/>Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity,<br/>Womanhood, and all that is a woman‚Äîand the man that comes from woman,<br/>The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks,<br/>  love-perturbations and risings,<br/>The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,<br/>Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,<br/>Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening,<br/>The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes,<br/>The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair,<br/>The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body,<br/>The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out,<br/>The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees,<br/>The thin red jellies within you, or within me‚Äîthe bones, and the marrow in the bones,<br/>The exquisite realization of health;<br/>O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul,<br/>O I say now these are the Soul!
