# üíÆ Greenland's Icy Mountains by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    Greenland's icy mountains are fascinating and grand,<br/>And wondrously created by the Almighty's command;<br/>And the works of the Almighty there's few can understand:<br/>Who knows but it might be a part of Fairyland?<br/><br/>Because there are churches of ice, and houses glittering like glass,<br/>And for scenic grandeur there's nothing can it surpass,<br/>Besides there's monuments and spires, also ruins,<br/>Which serve for a safe retreat from the wild bruins.<br/><br/>And there's icy crags and precipices, also beautiful waterfalls,<br/>And as the stranger gazes thereon, his heart it appals<br/>With a mixture of wonder, fear, and delight,<br/>Till at last he exclaims, Oh! what a wonderful sight!<br/><br/>The icy mountains they're higher than a brig's topmast,<br/>And the stranger in amazement stands aghast<br/>As he beholds the water flowing off the melted ice<br/>Adown the mountain sides, that he cries out, Oh! how nice!<br/><br/>Such sights as these are truly magnificent to be seen,<br/>Only that the mountain tops are white instead of green,<br/>And rents and caverns in them, the same as on a rugged mountain side,<br/>And suitable places, in my opinion, for mermaids to reside.<br/><br/>Sometimes these icy mountains suddenly topple o'er<br/>With a wild and rumbling hollow-starting roar;<br/>And new peaks and cliffs rise up out of the sea,<br/>While great cataracts of uplifted brine pour down furiously.<br/><br/>And those that can witness such an awful sight<br/>Can only gaze thereon in solemn silence and delight,<br/>And the most Godfearless man that hath this region trod<br/>Would be forced to recognise the power and majesty of God.<br/><br/>Oh! how awful and grand it must be on a sunshiny day<br/>To see one of these icy mountains in pieces give way!<br/>While, crack after crack, it falls with a mighty crash<br/>Flat upon the sea with a fearful splash.<br/><br/>And in the breaking up of these mountains they roar like thunder,<br/>Which causes the stranger no doubt to wonder;<br/>Also the Esquimaux of Greenland betimes will stand<br/>And gaze on the wondrous work of the Almighty so grand.<br/><br/>When these icy mountains are falling, the report is like big guns,<br/>And the glittering brilliancy of them causes mock-suns,<br/>And around them there's connected a beautiful ring of light,<br/>And as the stranger looks thereon, it fills his heart with delight.<br/><br/>Oh! think on the danger of seafaring men<br/>If any of these mighty mountains where falling on them;<br/>Alas! they would be killed ere the hand of man could them save<br/>And, poor creatures, very likely find a watery grave!<br/><br/>'Tis most beautiful to see and hear the whales whistling and blowing,<br/>And the sailors in their small boats quickly after them rowing,<br/>While the whales keep lashing the water all their might<br/>With their mighty tails, left and right.<br/><br/>In winter there's no sunlight there night or day,<br/>Which, no doubt, will cause the time to pass tediously away,<br/>And cause the Esquimaux to long for the light of day,<br/>So as they will get basking themselves in the sun's bright array.<br/><br/>In summer there is perpetual sunlight,<br/>Which fill the Esquimaux's hearts with delight;<br/>And is seen every day and night in the blue sky,<br/>Which makes the scenery appear most beautiful to the eye.<br/><br/>During summer and winter there the land is covered with snow,<br/>Which sometimes must fill the Esquimaux' hearts with woe<br/>As they traverse fields of ice, ten or fifteen feet thick,<br/>And with cold, no doubt, their hearts will be touched to the quick.<br/><br/>And let those that read or hear this feel thankful to God<br/>That the icy fields of Greenland they have never trod;<br/>Especially while seated around the fireside on a cold winter night,<br/>Let them think of the cold and hardships Greenland sailors have to fight.
