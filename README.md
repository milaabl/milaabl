# üíÆ The Death of Cromwell by *Andrew Marvell*

<p>
    A Poem upon the Death of His Late Highness the Lord Protector<br/><br/>That Providence which had so long the care<br/>Of Cromwell's head, and numbered every hair,<br/>Now in itself (the glass where all appears)<br/>Had seen the period of his golden years:<br/>And thenceforh only did attend to trace<br/>What death might least so fair a life deface.<br/><br/>The people, which what most they fear esteem,<br/>Death when more horrid, so more noble deem,<br/>And blame the last act, like spectators vain,<br/>Unless the prince whom they applaud be slain.<br/>Nor fate indeed can well refuse that right<br/>To those that lived in war, to die in fight.<br/><br/>But long his valour none had left that could<br/>Endanger him, or clemency that would.<br/>And he whom Nature all for peace had made,<br/>But angry heaven unto war had swayed,<br/>And so less useful where he most desired,<br/>For what he least affected was admired,<br/>Deserv–∏d yet an end whose every part,<br/>Should speak the wondrous softness of his heart.<br/><br/>To Love and Grief the fatal writ was 'signed;<br/>(Those nobler weaknesses of human kind,<br/>From which those powers that issued the decree,<br/>Although immortal, found they were not free),<br/>That they, to whom his breast still open lies,<br/>In gentle passions should his death disguise:<br/>And leave succeeding ages cause to mourn,<br/>As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.<br/><br/>Straight does a slow and languishing disease<br/>Eliza, Nature's and his darling, seize.<br/>Her when an infant, taken with her charms,<br/>He oft would flourish in his mighty arms,<br/>And, lest their force the tender burden wrong,<br/>Slacken the vigour of his muscles strong;<br/>Then to the Mother's breast her softly move,<br/>Which while she drained of milk, she filled with love.<br/>But as with riper years her virtue grew,<br/>And every minute adds a lustre new,<br/>When with meridian height her beauty shined,<br/>And thorough that sparkled her fairer mind,<br/>When she with smiles serene in words discreet<br/>His hidden soul at ever turn could meet;<br/>Then might y'ha' daily his affection spied,<br/>Doubling that knot which destiny had tied,<br/>While they by sense, not knowing, comprehend<br/>How on each other both their fates depend.<br/>With her each day the pleasing hours he shares,<br/>And at her aspect calms his growing cares;<br/>Or with a grandsire's joy her children sees<br/>Hanging about her neck or at his knees.<br/>Hold fast, dear infants, hold them both or none;<br/>This will not stay when once the other's gone.<br/><br/>A silent fire now wastes those limbs of wax,<br/>And him within his tortured image racks.<br/>So the flower withering which the garden crowned,<br/>The sad root pines in secret under ground.<br/>Each groan he doubled and each sigh he sighed,<br/>Repeated over to the restless night.<br/>No trembling string composed to numbers new,<br/>Answers the touch in notes more sad, more true.<br/>She, lest he grieve, hides what she can her pains,<br/>And he to lessen hers his sorrow feigns:<br/>Yet both perceived, yet both concealed their skills,<br/>And so diminishing increased their ills:<br/>That whether by each other's grief they fell,<br/>Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.<br/><br/>And now Eliza's purple locks were shorn,<br/>Where she so long her Father's fate had worn:<br/>And frequent lightning to her soul that flies,<br/>Divides the air, and opens all the skies:<br/>And now his life, suspended by her breath,<br/>Ran out impetuously to hasting death.<br/>Like polished mirrors, so his steely breast<br/>Had every figure of her woes expressed,<br/>And with the damp of her last gasp obscured,<br/>Had drawn such stains as were not to be cured.<br/>Fate could not either reach with single stroke,<br/>But the dear image fled, the mirror broke.<br/><br/>Who now shall tell us more of mournful swans,<br/>Of halcyons kind, or bleeding pelicans?<br/>No downy breast did e'er so gently beat,<br/>Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat.<br/>For he no duty by his height excused,<br/>Nor, though a prince, to be a man refused:<br/>But rather than in his Eliza's pain<br/>Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign:<br/>And in himself so oft immortal tried,<br/>Yet in compassion of another died.<br/><br/>So have I seen a vine, whose lasting age<br/>Of many a winter hath survived the rage,<br/>Under whose shady tent men every year<br/>At its rich blood's expense their sorrow cheer,<br/>If some dear branch where it extends its life<br/>Chance to be pruned by an untimely knife,<br/>The parent-tree unto the grief succeeds,<br/>And through the wound its vital humour bleeds,<br/>Trickling in watery drops, whose flowing shape<br/>Weeps that it falls ere fixed into a grape.<br/>So the dry stock, no more that spreading vine,<br/>Frustrates the autumn and the hopes of wine.<br/><br/>A secret cause does sure those signs ordain<br/>Foreboding princes' falls, and seldom vain.<br/>Whether some kinder powers that wish us well,<br/>What they above cannot prevent foretell;<br/>Or the great world do by consent presage,<br/>As hollow seas with future tempests rage;<br/>Or rather heaven, which us so long foresees,<br/>Their funerals celebrates while it decrees.<br/>But never yet was any human fate<br/>By Nature solemnized with so much state.<br/>He unconcerned the dreadful passage crossed;<br/>But, oh, what pangs that death did Nature cost!<br/><br/>First the great thunder was shot off, and sent<br/>The signal from the starry battlement.<br/>The winds receive it, and its force outdo,<br/>As practising how they could thunder too;<br/>Out of the binder's hand the sheaves they tore,<br/>And thrashed the harvest in the airy floor;<br/>Or of huge trees, whose growth with his did rise,<br/>The deep foundations opened to the skies.<br/>Then heavy show'rs the wing–∏d tempests lead,<br/>And pour the deluge o'er the chaos' head.<br/>The race of warlike horses at his tomb<br/>Offer themselves in many a hecatomb;<br/>With pensive head towards the ground they fall,<br/>And helpless languish at the tainted stall.<br/>Numbers of men decrease with pains unknown,<br/>And hasten, not to see his death, their own.<br/>Such tortures all the elements unfixed,<br/>Troubled to part where so exactly mixed.<br/>And as through air his wasting spirits flowed,<br/>The universe laboured beneath their load.<br/><br/>Nature, it seemed with him would Nature vie;<br/>He with Eliza. It with him would die,<br/>He without noise still travelled to his end,<br/>As silent suns to meet the night descend.<br/>The stars that for him fought had only power<br/>Left to determine now his final hour,<br/>Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast<br/>To choose it worthy of his glories past.<br/><br/>No part of time but bare his mark away<br/>Of honour; all the year was Cromwell's day:<br/>But this, of all the most ausicious found,<br/>Twice had in open field him victor crowned:<br/>When up the arm–∏d mountains of Dunbar<br/>He marched, and through deep Severn ending war.<br/>What day should him eternize but the same<br/>That had before immortalized his name?<br/>That so who ere would at his death have joyed,<br/>In their own griefs might find themselves employed;<br/>But those that sadly his departure grieved,<br/>Yet joyed, remebering what he once achieved.<br/>And the last minute his victorious ghost<br/>Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgic coast.<br/>Here ended all his mortal toils: he laid<br/>And slept in place under the laurel shade.<br/><br/>O Cromwell, Heaven's Favourite! To none<br/>Have such high honours from above been shown:<br/>For whom the elements we mourners see,<br/>And heaven itself would the great herald be,<br/>Which with more care set forth his obsequies<br/>Than those of Moses hid from human eyes,<br/>As jealous only here lest all be less,<br/>That we could to his memory express.<br/>Then let us to our course of mourning keep:<br/>Where heaven leads, 'tis piety to weep.<br/>Stand back, ye seas, and shrunk beneath the veil<br/>Of your abyss, with covered head bewail<br/>Your Monarch: we demand not your supplies<br/>To compass in our isle; our tears suffice:<br/>Since him away the dismal tempest rent,<br/>Who once more joined us to the continent;<br/>Who planted England on the Flandric shore,<br/>And stretched our frontier to the Indian ore;<br/>Whose greater truths obscure the fables old,<br/>Whether of British saints or Worthies told;<br/>And in a valour lessening Arthur's deeds,<br/>For holiness the Confessor exceeds.<br/><br/>He first put arms into Religion's hand,<br/>And timorous Conscience unto Courage manned:<br/>The soldier taught that inward mail to wear,<br/>And fearing God how they should nothing fear.<br/>`Those strokes,' he said, `will pierce through all below<br/>Where those that strike from heaven fetch their blow.'<br/>Astonished armies did their flight prepare,<br/>And cities strong were storm–∏d by his prayer;<br/>Of that, forever Preston's field shall tell<br/>The story, and impregnable Clonmel.<br/>And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scaled,<br/>The sea between, yet hence his prayer prevailed.<br/>What man was ever so in heaven obeyed<br/>Since the commanded sun o'er Gideon stayed?<br/>In all his wars needs must he triumph when<br/>He conquered God still ere he fought with men:<br/><br/>Hence, though in battle none so brave or fierce,<br/>Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce.<br/>Pity it seemed to hurt him more that felt<br/>Each wound himself which he to others dealt;<br/>Danger itself refusing to offend<br/>So loose an enemy, so fast a friend.<br/><br/>Friendship, that sacred virtue, long does claim<br/>The first foundation of his house and name:<br/>But within one its narrow limits fall,<br/>His tenderness extended unto all.<br/>And that deep soul through every channel flows,<br/>Where kindly nature loves itself to lose.<br/>More strong affections never reason served,<br/>Yet still affected most what best deserved.<br/>If he Eliza loved to that degree,<br/>(Though who more worthy to be loved than she?)<br/>If so indulgent to his own, how dear<br/>To him the children of the highest were?<br/>For her he once did nature's tribute pay:<br/>For these his life adventured every day:<br/>And 'twould be found, could we his thoughts have cast,<br/>Their griefs struck deepest, if Eliza's last.<br/><br/>What prudence more than human did he need<br/>To keep so dear, so differing minds agreed?<br/>The worser sort, as conscious of their ill,<br/>Lie weak and easy to the ruler's will;<br/>But to the good (too many or too few)<br/>All law is useless, all reward is due.<br/>Oh ill-advised, if not for love, for shame,<br/>Spare yet your own, if you neglect his fame;<br/>Lest others dare to think your zeal a mask,<br/>And you to govern, only heaven's task.<br/><br/>Valour, religion, friendship, prudence died<br/>At once with him, and all that's good beside;<br/>And we death's refuse, nature's dregs, confined<br/>To loathsome life, alas! are left behind.<br/>Where we (so once we used) shall now no more<br/>To fetch the day, press about his chamber door--<br/>From which he issued with that awful state,<br/>It seemd Mars broke through Janus' double gate,<br/>Yet always tempered with an air so mild,<br/>No April suns that e'er so gently smiled--<br/>No more shall hear that powerful language charm,<br/>Whose force oft spared the labour of his arm:<br/>No more shall follow where he spent the days<br/>In war, in counsel, or in prayer and praise,<br/>Whose meanest acts he would himself advance,<br/>As ungirt David to the ark did dance.<br/>All, all is gone of our or his delight<br/>In horses fierce, wild deer, or armour bright;<br/>Francisca fair can nothing now but weep,<br/>Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep.<br/><br/>I saw him dead. A leaden slumber lies<br/>And mortal sleep over those wakeful eyes:<br/>Those gentle rays under the lids were fled,<br/>Which through his looks that piercing sweetness shed;<br/>That port which so majestic was and strong,<br/>Loose and deprived of vigour, stretched along:<br/>All withered, all discoloured, pale and wan--<br/>How much another thing, nor more that man?<br/>Oh human glory vain, oh death, oh wings,<br/>Oh worthless world, oh transitory things!<br/><br/>Yet dwelt that greatnesss in his shape decayed,<br/>That still through dead, greater than death he laid:<br/>And in his altered face you something feign<br/>That threatens death he yet will live again.<br/><br/>Not much unlike the sacred oak which shoots<br/>To heaven its branches and through earth its roots,<br/>Whose spacious bought are hung with trophies round,<br/>And honoured wreaths have oft the victor crowned.<br/>When angry Jove darts lightning through the air,<br/>At mortals' sins, nor his own plant will spare,<br/>(It groans, and bruises all below, that stood<br/>So many years the shelter of the wood.)<br/>The tree erewhile foreshortened to our view,<br/>When fall'n shows taller yet than as it grew:<br/><br/>So shall his praise to after times increase,<br/>When truth shall be allowed, and faction cease,<br/>And his own shadows with him fall. The eye<br/>Detracts from object than itself more high:<br/>But when death takes them from that envied seat,<br/>Seeing how little, we confess how great.<br/><br/>Thee, many ages hence in martial verse<br/>Shall the English soldier, ere he charge, rehearse,<br/>Singing of thee, inflame themselves to fight,<br/>And with the name of Cromwell, armies fright.<br/>As long as rivers to the seas shall run,<br/>As long as Cynthia shall relieve the sun,<br/>While stags shall fly unto the firests thick,<br/>While sheep delight the grassy downs to pick,<br/>As long as future times succeeds the past,<br/>Always they honour, praise, and name shall last.<br/><br/>Thou in a pitch how far beyond the sphere<br/>Of human glory tower'st, and reigning there<br/>Despoiled of mortal robes, in seas of bliss,<br/>Plunging dost bathe, and tread the bright abyss:<br/>There thy great soul yet once a world does see,<br/>Spacious enough, and pure enough for thee.<br/>How soon thou Moses hast, and Joshua found,<br/>And David for the sword and harp renowned?<br/>How straight canst to each happy mansion go?<br/>(Far better known above than here below)<br/>And in those joys dost spend the endless day,<br/>Which in expressing we ourselves betray.<br/><br/>For we, since thou art gone, with heavy doom,<br/>Wander like ghosts about thy lov–∏d tomb;<br/>And lost in tears, have neither sight nor mind<br/>To guide us upward through this region blind.<br/>Since thou art gone, who best that way couldst teach,<br/>Only our sighs, perhaps, may thither reach.<br/><br/>And Richard yet, where his great parent led,<br/>Beats on the rugged track: he, virtue dead,<br/>Revives, and by his milder beams assures;<br/>And yet how much of them his grief obscures?<br/><br/>He, as his father, long was kept from sight<br/>In private, to be viewed by better light;<br/>But opened once, what splendour does he throw?<br/>A Cromwell in an hour a prince will grow.<br/>How he becomes that seat, how strongly strains,<br/>How gently winds at once the ruling reins?<br/>Heaven to this choice prepared a diadem,<br/>Richer than any Easter silk or gem;<br/>A pearly rainbow, where the sun enchased<br/>His brows, like an imperial jewel graced.<br/><br/>We find already what those omens mean,<br/>Earth ne'er more glad, nor heaven more serene.<br/>Cease now our griefs, calm peace succeeds a war,<br/>Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver.<br/>Tempt not his clemency to try his power,<br/>He threats no deluge, yet foretells a shower.
