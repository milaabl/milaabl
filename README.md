  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To William Shelley by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    The billows on the beach are leaping around it,<br/>The bark is weak and frail,<br/>The sea looks black, and the clouds that bound it<br/>Darkly strew the gale.<br/>Come with me, thou delightful child,<br/>Come with me, though the wave is wild,<br/>And the winds are loose, we must not stay,<br/>Or the slaves of the law may rend thee away.<br/><br/>They have taken thy brother and sister dear,<br/>They have made them unfit for thee;<br/>They have withered the smile and dried the tear<br/>Which should have been sacred to me.<br/>To a blighting faith and a cause of crime<br/>They have bound them slaves in youthly prime,<br/>And they will curse my name and thee<br/>Because we fearless are and free.<br/><br/>Come thou, beloved as thou art;<br/>Another sleepeth still<br/>Near thy sweet mother's anxious heart,<br/>Which thou with joy shalt fill,<br/>With fairest smiles of wonder thrown<br/>On that which is indeed our own,<br/>And which in distant lands will be<br/>The dearest playmate unto thee.<br/><br/>Fear not the tyrants will rule for ever,<br/>Or the priests of the evil faith;<br/>They stand on the brink of that raging river,<br/>Whose waves they have tainted with death.<br/>It is fed from the depth of a thousand dells,<br/>Around them it foams and rages and swells;<br/>And their swords and their sceptres I floating see,<br/>Like wrecks on the surge of eternity.<br/><br/>Rest, rest, and shriek not, thou gentle child!<br/>The rocking of the boat thou fearest,<br/>And the cold spray and the clamour wild?--<br/>There, sit between us two, thou dearest--<br/>Me and thy mother--well we know<br/>The storm at which thou tremblest so,<br/>With all its dark and hungry graves,<br/>Less cruel than the savage slaves<br/>Who hunt us o'er these sheltering waves.<br/><br/>This hour will in thy memory<br/>Be a dream of days forgotten long.<br/>We soon shall dwell by the azure sea<br/>Of serene and golden Italy,<br/>Or Greece, the Mother of the free;<br/>And I will teach thine infant tongue<br/>To call upon those heroes old<br/>In their own language, and will mould<br/>Thy growing spirit in the flame<br/>Of Grecian lore, that by such name<br/>A patriot's birthright thou mayst claim!
</p>
