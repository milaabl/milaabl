# üíÆ General Gordon, the Hero of Khartoum by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    Alas! now o'er the civilised world there hangs a gloom<br/>For brave General Gordon, that was killed in Khartoum,<br/>He was a Christian hero, and a soldier of the Cross,<br/>And to England his death will be a very great loss.<br/><br/>He was very cool in temper, generous and brave,<br/>The friend of the poor, the sick, and the slave;<br/>And many a poor boy he did educate,<br/>And laboured hard to do so early and late.<br/><br/>He was a man that did not care for worldly gear,<br/>Because the living and true God he did fear;<br/>And the hearts of the poor he liked to cheer,<br/>And by his companions in arms he was loved most dear.<br/><br/>He always took the Bible for his guide,<br/>And he liked little boys to walk by his side;<br/>He preferred their company more so than men,<br/>Because he knew there was less guile in them.<br/><br/>And in his conversation he was modest and plain,<br/>Denouncing all pleasures he considered sinful and vain,<br/>And in battle he carried no weapon but a small cane,<br/>Whilst the bullets fell around him like a shower of rain.<br/><br/>He burnt the debtors' books that were imprisoned in Khartoum,<br/>And freed them from a dismal prison gloom,<br/>Those that were imprisoned for debt they couldn't pay,<br/>And sent them rejoicing on their way.<br/><br/>While engaged in the Russian war, in the midst of the fight,<br/>He stood upon a rising ground and viewed them left and right,<br/>But for their shot and shell he didn't care a jot,<br/>While the officers cried, Gordon, come down, or else you'll be shot.<br/><br/>His cane was christened by the soldiers Gordon's wand of victory<br/>And when he waved it the soldiers' hearts were filled with glee<br/>While with voice and gesture he encouraged them in the strife,<br/>And he himself appeared to possess a charmed life.<br/><br/>Once when leading a storming party the soldiers drew back,<br/>But he quickly observed that courage they did lack,<br/>Then he calmly lighted a cigar, and turned cheerfully found,<br/>And the soldiers rushed boldly on with a bound.<br/><br/>And they carried the position without delay,<br/>And the Chinese rebels soon gave way,<br/>Because God was with him during the day,<br/>And with those that trust Him for ever and aye.<br/><br/>He was always willing to conduct meetings for the poor,<br/>Also meat and clothing for them he tried to procure,<br/>And he always had little humorous speeches at command,<br/>And to hear him deliver them it must have been grand.<br/><br/>In military life his equal couldn't he found,<br/>No! if you were to search the wide world around,<br/>And 'tis pitiful to think he has met with such a doom<br/>By a base traitor knave while in Khartoum.<br/><br/>Yes, the black-hearted traitor opened the gates of Khartoum,<br/>And through that the Christian hero has met his doom,<br/>For when the gates were opened the Arabs rushed madly in,<br/>And foully murdered him while they laughingly did grin.<br/><br/>But he defended himself nobly with axe and sword in hand,<br/>But, alas! he was soon overpowered by that savage band,<br/>And his body received a hundred spear wounds and more,<br/>While his murderers exultingly did loudly shriek and roar.<br/><br/>But heaven's will,'tis said, must be done,<br/>And according to his own opinion his time was come;<br/>But I hope he is now in heaven reaping his reward.<br/>Although his fate on earth was really very hard.<br/><br/>I hope the people will his memory revere,<br/>And take an example from him, and worship God in fear,<br/>And never be too fond of worldly gear,<br/>And walk in General Gordon's footsteps, while they are here.
