<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Sonnet LVIII: In Former Times by *Michael Drayton*

<p>
    In former times such as had store of coin,<br/>In wars at home, or when for conquests bound,<br/>For fear that some their treasure should purloin,<br/>Gave it to keep to spirits within the ground,<br/>And to attend it them as strongly tied<br/>Till they return'd; home when they never came,<br/>Such as by art to get the same have tried<br/>From the strong Spirit by no means force the same;<br/>Nearer men come, that further flies away,<br/>Striving to hold it strongly in the deep.<br/>E'en as this Spirit, so you alone do play<br/>With those rich beauties Heav'n gives you to keep;<br/>Pity, so left to the coldness of your blood,<br/>Not to avail you, nor do the others good.
</p>
