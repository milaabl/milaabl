# üíÆ A Very Mournful Ballad on the Siege and Conquest of Alhama by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    The Moorish King rides up and down.<br/>Through Granada's royal town:<br/>From Elvira's gates to those<br/>Of Bivarambla on he goes.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>Letters to the Monarch tell<br/>How Alhama's city fell:<br/>In the fire the scroll he threw,<br/>And the messenger he slew.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>He quits his mule, and mounts his horse,<br/>And through the street directs his course;<br/>Through the street of Zacatin<br/>To the Alhambra spurring in.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>When the Alhambra walls he gained,<br/>On the moment he ordained<br/>That the trumpet straight should sound<br/>With the silver clarion round.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>And when the hollow drums of war<br/>Beat the loud alarm afar,<br/>That the Moors of town and plain<br/>Might answer to the martial strain.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>Then the Moors, by this aware,<br/>That bloody Mars recalled them there,<br/>One by one, and two by two,<br/>To a mighty squadron grew.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>Out then spake an aged Moor<br/>In these words the king before,<br/>"Wherefore call on us, oh King?<br/>What may mean this gathering?"<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"Friends! ye have, alas! to know<br/>Of a most disastrous blow--<br/>That the Christians, stern and bold,<br/>Have obtained Alhama's hold."<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>Out then spake old Alfaqui,<br/>With his beard so white to see,<br/>"Good King! thou art justly served,<br/>Good King! this thou hast deserved.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"By thee were slain, in evil hour,<br/>The Abencerrage, Granada's flower;<br/>And strangers were received by thee,<br/>Of Cordova the Chivalry.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"And for this, oh King! is sent<br/>On thee a double chastisement;<br/>Thee and thine, thy crown and realm,<br/>One last wreck shall overwhelm.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"He who holds no laws in awe,<br/>He must perish by the law;<br/>And Granada must be won,<br/>And thyself with her undone."<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>Fire flashed from out the old Moor's eyes,<br/>The Monarch's wrath began to rise,<br/>Because he answered, and because<br/>He spake exceeding well of laws.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"There is no law to say such things<br/>As may disgust the ear of kings:"--<br/>Thus, snorting with his choler, said<br/>The Moorish King, and doomed him dead.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui!<br/>Though thy beard so hoary be,<br/>The King hath sent to have thee seized,<br/>For Alhama's loss displeased.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>And to fix thy head upon<br/>High Alhambra's loftiest stone;<br/>That this for thee should be the law,<br/>And others tremble when they saw.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"Cavalier, and man of worth!<br/>Let these words of mine go forth;<br/>Let the Moorish Monarch know,<br/>That to him I nothing owe.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"But on my soul Alhama weighs,<br/>And on my inmost spirit preys;<br/>And if the King his land hath lost,<br/>Yet others may have lost the most.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"Sires have lost their children, wives<br/>Their lords, and valiant men their lives!<br/>One what best his love might claim<br/>Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>"I lost a damsel in that hour,<br/>Of all the land the loveliest flower;<br/>Doubloons a hundred I would pay,<br/>And think her ransom cheap that day."<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>And as these things the old Moor said,<br/>They severed from the trunk his head;<br/>And to the Alhambra's wall with speed<br/>'Twas carried, as the King decreed.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>And men and infants therein weep<br/>Their loss, so heavy and so deep;<br/>Granada's ladies, all she rears<br/>Within her walls, burst into tears.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!<br/><br/>And from the windows o'er the walls<br/>The sable web of mourning falls;<br/>The King weeps as a woman o'er<br/>His loss, for it is much and sore.<br/>                    Woe is me, Alhama!
