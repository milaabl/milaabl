<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Super Flumina Babylonis by *Algernon Charles Swinburne*

<p>
    By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept,<br/>Remembering thee,<br/>That for ages of agony hast endured, and slept,<br/>And wouldst not see.<br/><br/>By the waters of Babylon we stood up and sang,<br/>Considering thee,<br/>That a blast of deliverance in the darkness rang,<br/>To set thee free.<br/><br/>And with trumpets and thunderings and with morning song<br/>Came up the light;<br/>And thy spirit uplifted thee to forget thy wrong<br/>As day doth night.<br/><br/>And thy sons were dejected not any more, as then<br/>When thou wast shamed;<br/>When thy lovers went heavily without heart, as men<br/>Whose life was maimed.<br/><br/>In the desolate distances, with a great desire,<br/>For thy love's sake,<br/>With our hearts going back to thee, they were filled with fire,<br/>Were nigh to break.<br/><br/>It was said to us: "Verily ye are great of heart,<br/>But ye shall bend;<br/>Ye are bondmen and bondwomen, to be scourged and smart,<br/>To toil and tend."<br/><br/>And with harrows men harrowed us, and subdued with spears,<br/>And crushed with shame;<br/>And the summer and winter was, and the length of years,<br/>And no change came.<br/><br/>By the rivers of Italy, by the sacred streams,<br/>By town, by tower,<br/>There was feasting with revelling, there was sleep with dreams,<br/>Until thine hour.<br/><br/>And they slept and they rioted on their rose-hung beds,<br/>With mouths on flame,<br/>And with love-locks vine-chapleted, and with rose-crowned heads<br/>And robes of shame.<br/><br/>And they knew not their forefathers, nor the hills and streams<br/>And words of power,<br/>Nor the gods that were good to them, but with songs and dreams<br/>Filled up their hour.<br/><br/>By the rivers of Italy, by the dry streams' beds,<br/>When thy time came,<br/>There was casting of crowns from them, from their young men's heads,<br/>The crowns of shame.<br/><br/>By the horn of Eridanus, by the Tiber mouth,<br/>As thy day rose,<br/>They arose up and girded them to the north and south,<br/>By seas, by snows.<br/><br/>As a water in January the frost confines,<br/>Thy kings bound thee;<br/>As a water in April is, in the new-blown vines,<br/>Thy sons made free.<br/><br/>And thy lovers that looked for thee, and that mourned from far,<br/>For thy sake dead,<br/>We rejoiced in the light of thee, in the signal star<br/>Above thine head.<br/><br/>In thy grief had we followed thee, in thy passion loved,<br/>Loved in thy loss;<br/>In thy shame we stood fast to thee, with thy pangs were moved,<br/>Clung to thy cross.<br/><br/>By the hillside of Calvary we beheld thy blood,<br/>Thy bloodred tears,<br/>As a mother's in bitterness, an unebbing flood,<br/>Years upon years.<br/><br/>And the north was Gethsemane, without leaf or bloom,<br/>A garden sealed;<br/>And the south was Aceldama, for a sanguine fume<br/>Hid all the field.<br/><br/>By the stone of the sepulchre we returned to weep,<br/>From far, from prison;<br/>And the guards by it keeping it we beheld asleep,<br/>But thou wast risen.<br/><br/>And an angel's similitude by the unsealed grave,<br/>And by the stone:<br/>And the voice was angelical, to whose words God gave<br/>Strength like his own.<br/><br/>"Lo, the graveclothes of Italy that are folded up<br/>In the grave's gloom!<br/>And the guards as men wrought upon with a charmed cup,<br/>By the open tomb.<br/><br/>"And her body most beautiful, and her shining head,<br/>These are not here;<br/>For your mother, for Italy, is not surely dead:<br/>Have ye no fear.<br/><br/>"As of old time she spake to you, and you hardly heard,<br/>Hardly took heed,<br/>So now also she saith to you, yet another word,<br/>Who is risen indeed.<br/><br/>"By my saying she saith to you, in your ears she saith,<br/>Who hear these things,<br/>Put no trust in men's royalties, nor in great men's breath,<br/>Nor words of kings.<br/><br/>"For the life of them vanishes and is no more seen,<br/>Nor no more known;<br/>Nor shall any remember him if a crown hath been,<br/>Or where a throne.<br/><br/>"Unto each man his handiwork, unto each his crown,<br/>The just Fate gives;<br/>Whoso takes the world's life on him and his own lays down,<br/>He, dying so, lives.<br/><br/>"Whoso bears the whole heaviness of the wronged world's weight<br/>And puts it by,<br/>It is well with him suffering, though he face man's fate;<br/>How should he die?<br/><br/>"Seeing death has no part in him any more, no power<br/>Upon his head;<br/>He has bought his eternity with a little hour,<br/>And is not dead.<br/><br/>"For an hour, if ye look for him, he is no more found,<br/>For one hour's space;<br/>Then ye lift up your eyes to him and behold him crowned,<br/>A deathless face.<br/><br/>"On the mountains of memory, by the world's wellsprings,<br/>In all men's eyes,<br/>Where the light of the life of him is on all past things,<br/>Death only dies.<br/><br/>"Not the light that was quenched for us, nor the deeds that were,<br/>Nor the ancient days,<br/>Nor the sorrows not sorrowful, nor the face most fair<br/>Of perfect praise."<br/><br/>So the angel of Italy's resurrection said,<br/>So yet he saith;<br/>So the son of her suffering, that from breasts nigh dead<br/>Drew life, not death.<br/><br/>That the pavement of Golgotha should be white as snow,<br/>Not red, but white;<br/>That the waters of Babylon should no longer flow,<br/>And men see light.
