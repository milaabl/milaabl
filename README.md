# üíÆ King Arthur's Tomb by *William Morris*

<p>
    Hot August noon: already on that day<br/>Since sunrise through the Wiltshire downs, most sad<br/>Of mouth and eye, he had gone leagues of way;<br/>Ay and by night, till whether good or bad<br/><br/>He was, he knew not, though he knew perchance<br/>That he was Launcelot, the bravest knight<br/>Of all who since the world was, have borne lance,<br/>Or swung their swords in wrong cause or in right.<br/><br/>Nay, he knew nothing now, except that where<br/>The Glastonbury gilded towers shine,<br/>A lady dwelt, whose name was Guenevere;<br/>This he knew also; that some fingers twine,<br/><br/>Not only in a man's hair, even his heart,<br/>(Making him good or bad I mean,) but in his life,<br/>Skies, earth, men's looks and deeds, all that has part,<br/>Not being ourselves, in that half-sleep, half-strife,<br/><br/>(Strange sleep, strange strife,) that men call living; so<br/>Was Launcelot most glad when the moon rose,<br/>Because it brought new memories of her. "Lo,<br/>Between the trees a large moon, the wind lows<br/><br/>"Not loud, but as a cow begins to low,<br/>Wishing for strength to make the herdsman hear:<br/>The ripe corn gathereth dew; yea, long ago,<br/>In the old garden life, my Guenevere<br/><br/>"Loved to sit still among the flowers, till night<br/>Had quite come on, hair loosen'd, for she said,<br/>Smiling like heaven, that its fairness might<br/>Draw up the wind sooner to cool her head.<br/><br/>"Now while I ride how quick the moon gets small,<br/>As it did then: I tell myself a tale<br/>That will not last beyond the whitewashed wall,<br/>Thoughts of some joust must help me through the vale,<br/><br/>"Keep this till after: How Sir Gareth ran<br/>A good course that day under my Queen's eyes,<br/>And how she sway'd laughing at Dinadan.<br/>No. Back again, the other thoughts will rise,<br/><br/>"And yet I think so fast 'twill end right soon:<br/>Verily then I think, that Guenevere,<br/>Made sad by dew and wind, and tree-barred moon,<br/>Did love me more than ever, was more dear<br/><br/>"To me than ever, she would let me lie<br/>And kiss her feet, or, if I sat behind,<br/>Would drop her hand and arm most tenderly,<br/>And touch my mouth. And she would let me wind<br/><br/>"Her hair around my neck, so that it fell<br/>Upon my red robe, strange in the twilight<br/>With many unnamed colours, till the bell<br/>Of her mouth on my cheek sent a delight<br/><br/>"Through all my ways of being; like the stroke<br/>Wherewith God threw all men upon the face<br/>When he took Enoch, and when Enoch woke<br/>With a changed body in the happy place.<br/><br/>"Once, I remember, as I sat beside,<br/>She turn'd a little, and laid back her head,<br/>And slept upon my breast; I almost died<br/>In those night-watches with my love and dread.<br/><br/>"There lily-like she bow'd her head and slept,<br/>And I breathed low, and did not dare to move,<br/>But sat and quiver'd inwardly, thoughts crept,<br/>And frighten'd me with pulses of my Love.<br/><br/>"The stars shone out above the doubtful green<br/>Of her bodice, in the green sky overhead;<br/>Pale in the green sky were the stars I ween,<br/>Because the moon shone like a star she shed<br/><br/>"When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago,<br/>And ruled all things but God: the night went on,<br/>The wind grew cold, and the white moon grew low,<br/>One hand had fallen down, and now lay on<br/><br/>"My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then<br/>For near an hour, and I fell asleep<br/>In spite of all my striving, even when<br/>I held her whose name-letters make me leap.<br/><br/>"I did not sleep long, feeling that in sleep<br/>I did some loved one wrong, so that the sun<br/>Had only just arisen from the deep<br/>Still land of colours, when before me one<br/><br/>"Stood whom I knew, but scarcely dared to touch,<br/>She seemed to have changed so in the night;<br/>Moreover she held scarlet lilies, such<br/>As Maiden Margaret bears upon the light<br/><br/>"Of the great church walls, natheless did I walk<br/>Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,<br/>Touching her hair and hand and mouth, and talk<br/>Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn.<br/><br/>"Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high,<br/>We went, and in a cool green room all day<br/>I gazed upon the arras giddily,<br/>Where the wind set the silken kings a-sway.<br/><br/>"I could not hold her hand, or see her face;<br/>For which may God forgive me! but I think,<br/>Howsoever, that she was not in that place."<br/>These memories Launcelot was quick to drink;<br/><br/>And when these fell, some paces past the wall,<br/>There rose yet others, but they wearied more,<br/>And tasted not so sweet; they did not fall<br/>So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore<br/><br/>In shadowy slipping from his grasp: these gone,<br/>A longing followed; if he might but touch<br/>That Guenevere at once! Still night, the lone<br/>Grey horse's head before him vex'd him much,<br/><br/>In steady nodding over the grey road:<br/>Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart<br/>Of any stories; what a dismal load<br/>Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,<br/><br/>And let the sun flame over all, still there<br/>The horse's grey ears turn'd this way and that,<br/>And still he watch'd them twitching in the glare<br/>Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,<br/><br/>Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,<br/>Until about the dustiest of the day,<br/>On the last down's brow he drew his rein in sight<br/>Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way.<br/><br/>And he was now quite giddy as before,<br/>When she slept by him, tired out, and her hair<br/>Was mingled with the rushes on the floor,<br/>And he, being tired too, was scarce aware<br/><br/>Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,<br/>A shiver ran throughout him, and his breath<br/>Came slower, he seem'd suddenly amazed,<br/>As though he had not heard of Arthur's death.<br/><br/>This for a moment only, presently<br/>He rode on giddy still, until he reach'd<br/>A place of apple-trees, by the thorn-tree<br/>Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached.<br/><br/>Dazed there he laid his head upon a tomb,<br/>Not knowing it was Arthur's, at which sight<br/>One of her maidens told her, "He is come,"<br/>And she went forth to meet him; yet a blight<br/><br/>Had settled on her, all her robes were black,<br/>With a long white veil only; she went slow,<br/>As one walks to be slain, her eyes did lack<br/>Half her old glory, yea, alas! the glow<br/><br/>Had left her face and hands; this was because<br/>As she lay last night on her purple bed,<br/>Wishing for morning, grudging every pause<br/>Of the palace clocks, until that Launcelot's head<br/><br/>Should lie on her breast, with all her golden hair<br/>Each side: when suddenly the thing grew drear,<br/>In morning twilight, when the grey downs bare<br/>Grew into lumps of sin to Guenevere.<br/><br/>At first she said no word, but lay quite still,<br/>Only her mouth was open, and her eyes<br/>Gazed wretchedly about from hill to hill;<br/>As though she asked, not with so much surprise<br/><br/>As tired disgust, what made them stand up there<br/>So cold and grey. After, a spasm took<br/>Her face, and all her frame, she caught her hair,<br/>All her hair, in both hands, terribly she shook,<br/><br/>And rose till she was sitting in the bed,<br/>Set her teeth hard, and shut her eyes and seem'd<br/>As though she would have torn it from her head,<br/>Natheless she dropp'd it, lay down, as she deem'd<br/><br/>It matter'd not whatever she might do:<br/>O Lord Christ! pity on her ghastly face!<br/>Those dismal hours while the cloudless blue<br/>Drew the sun higher: He did give her grace;<br/><br/>Because at last she rose up from her bed,<br/>And put her raiment on, and knelt before<br/>The blessed rood, and with her dry lips said,<br/>Muttering the words against the marble floor:<br/><br/>"Unless you pardon, what shall I do, Lord,<br/>But go to hell? and there see day by day<br/>Foul deed on deed, hear foulest word on word,<br/>For ever and ever, such as on the way<br/><br/>"To Camelot I heard once from a churl,<br/>That curled me up upon my jennet's neck<br/>With bitter shame; how then, Lord, should I curl<br/>For ages and for ages? dost thou reck<br/><br/>"That I am beautiful, Lord, even as you<br/>And your dear mother? why did I forget<br/>You were so beautiful, and good, and true,<br/>That you loved me so, Guenevere? O yet<br/><br/>"If even I go to hell, I cannot choose<br/>But love you, Christ, yea, though I cannot keep<br/>From loving Launcelot; O Christ! must I lose<br/>My own heart's love? see, though I cannot weep,<br/><br/>"Yet am I very sorry for my sin;<br/>Moreover, Christ, I cannot bear that hell,<br/>I am most fain to love you, and to win<br/>A place in heaven some time: I cannot tell:<br/><br/>"Speak to me, Christ! I kiss, kiss, kiss your feet;<br/>Ah! now I weep!" The maid said, "By the tomb<br/>He waiteth for you, lady," coming fleet,<br/>Not knowing what woe filled up all the room.<br/><br/>So Guenevere rose and went to meet him there,<br/>He did not hear her coming, as he lay<br/>On Arthur's head, till some of her long hair<br/>Brush'd on the new-cut stone: "Well done! to pray<br/><br/>"For Arthur, my dear Lord, the greatest king<br/>That ever lived." "Guenevere! Guenevere!<br/>Do you not know me, are you gone mad? fling<br/>Your arms and hair about me, lest I fear<br/><br/>"You are not Guenevere, but some other thing."<br/>"Pray you forgive me, fair lord Launcelot!<br/>I am not mad, but I am sick; they cling,<br/>God's curses, unto such as I am; not<br/><br/>"Ever again shall we twine arms and lips."<br/>"Yea, she is mad: thy heavy law, O Lord,<br/>Is very tight about her now, and grips<br/>Her poor heart, so that no right word<br/><br/>"Can reach her mouth; so, Lord, forgive her now,<br/>That she not knowing what she does, being mad,<br/>Kills me in this way: Guenevere, bend low<br/>And kiss me once! for God's love kiss me! sad<br/><br/>"Though your face is, you look much kinder now;<br/>Yea once, once for the last time kiss me, lest I die."<br/>"Christ! my hot lips are very near his brow,<br/>Help me to save his soul! Yea, verily,<br/><br/>"Across my husband's head, fair Launcelot!<br/>Fair serpent mark'd with V upon the head!<br/>This thing we did while yet he was alive,<br/>Why not, O twisting knight, now he is dead?<br/><br/>"Yea, shake! shake now and shiver! if you can<br/>Remember anything for agony,<br/>Pray you remember how when the wind ran<br/>One cool spring evening through fair aspen-tree,<br/><br/>"And elm and oak about the palace there<br/>The king came back from battle, and I stood<br/>To meet him, with my ladies, on the stair,<br/>My face made beautiful with my young blood."<br/><br/>"Will she lie now, Lord God?" "Remember too,<br/>Wrung heart, how first before the knights there came<br/>A royal bier, hung round with green and blue,<br/>About it shone great tapers with sick flame.<br/><br/>"And thereupon Lucius, the Emperor,<br/>Lay royal-robed, but stone-cold now and dead,<br/>Not able to hold sword or sceptre more,<br/>But not quite grim; because his cloven head<br/><br/>"Bore no marks now of Launcelot's bitter sword,<br/>Being by embalmers deftly solder'd up;<br/>So still it seem'd the face of a great lord,<br/>Being mended as a craftsman mends a cup.<br/><br/>"Also the heralds sung rejoicingly<br/>To their long trumpets; 'Fallen under shield,<br/>Here lieth Lucius, King of Italy,<br/>Slain by Lord Launcelot in open field.'<br/><br/>"Thereat the people shouted: 'Launcelot!'<br/>And through the spears I saw you drawing nigh,<br/>You and Lord Arthur: nay, I saw you not,<br/>But rather Arthur, God would not let die,<br/><br/>"I hoped, these many years; he should grow great,<br/>And in his great arms still encircle me,<br/>Kissing my face, half blinded with the heat<br/>Of king's love for the queen I used to be.<br/><br/>"Launcelot, Launcelot, why did he take your hand,<br/>When he had kissed me in his kingly way?<br/>Saying: 'This is the knight whom all the land<br/>Calls Arthur's banner, sword, and shield to-day;<br/><br/>"'Cherish him, love.' Why did your long lips cleave<br/>In such strange way unto my fingers then?<br/>So eagerly glad to kiss, so loath to leave<br/>When you rose up? Why among helmed men<br/><br/>"Could I always tell you by your long strong arms,<br/>And sway like an angel's in your saddle there?<br/>Why sicken'd I so often with alarms<br/>Over the tilt-yard? Why were you more fair<br/><br/>"Than aspens in the autumn at their best?<br/>Why did you fill all lands with your great fame,<br/>So that Breuse even, as he rode, fear'd lest<br/>At turning of the way your shield should flame?<br/><br/>"Was it nought then, my agony and strife?<br/>When as day passed by day, year after year,<br/>I found I could not live a righteous life!<br/>Didst ever think queens held their truth for dear?<br/><br/>"O, but your lips say: 'Yea, but she was cold<br/>Sometimes, always uncertain as the spring;<br/>When I was sad she would be overbold,<br/>Longing for kisses. When war-bells did ring,<br/><br/>"'The back-toll'd bells of noisy Camelot.'"<br/>"Now, Lord God, listen! listen, Guenevere,<br/>Though I am weak just now, I think there's not<br/>A man who dares to say: 'You hated her,<br/><br/>"'And left her moaning while you fought your fill<br/>In the daisied meadows!' lo you her thin hand,<br/>That on the carven stone can not keep still,<br/>Because she loves me against God's command,<br/><br/>"Has often been quite wet with tear on tear,<br/>Tears Launcelot keeps somewhere, surely not<br/>In his own heart, perhaps in Heaven, where<br/>He will not be these ages." "Launcelot!<br/><br/>"Loud lips, wrung heart! I say when the bells rang,<br/>The noisy back-toll'd bells of Camelot,<br/>There were two spots on earth, the thrushes sang<br/>In the lonely gardens where my love was not,<br/><br/>"Where I was almost weeping; I dared not<br/>Weep quite in those days, lest one maid should say,<br/>In tittering whispers: 'Where is Launcelot<br/>To wipe with some kerchief those tears away?'<br/><br/>"Another answer sharply with brows knit,<br/>And warning hand up, scarcely lower though:<br/>'You speak too loud, see you, she heareth it,<br/>This tigress fair has claws, as I well know,<br/><br/>"'As Launcelot knows too, the poor knight! well-a-day!<br/>Why met he not with Iseult from the West,<br/>Or better still, Iseult of Brittany?<br/>Perchance indeed quite ladyless were best.'<br/><br/>"Alas, my maids, you loved not overmuch<br/>Queen Guenevere, uncertain as sunshine<br/>In March; forgive me! for my sin being such,<br/>About my whole life, all my deeds did twine,<br/><br/>"Made me quite wicked; as I found out then,<br/>I think; in the lonely palace where each morn<br/>We went, my maids and I, to say prayers when<br/>They sang mass in the chapel on the lawn.<br/><br/>"And every morn I scarce could pray at all,<br/>For Launcelot's red-golden hair would play,<br/>Instead of sunlight, on the painted wall,<br/>Mingled with dreams of what the priest did say;<br/><br/>"Grim curses out of Peter and of Paul;<br/>Judging of strange sins in Leviticus;<br/>Another sort of writing on the wall,<br/>Scored deep across the painted heads of us.<br/><br/>"Christ sitting with the woman at the well,<br/>And Mary Magdalen repenting there,<br/>Her dimmed eyes scorch'd and red at sight of hell<br/>So hardly 'scaped, no gold light on her hair.<br/><br/>"And if the priest said anything that seemed<br/>To touch upon the sin they said we did,<br/>(This in their teeth) they looked as if they deem'd<br/>That I was spying what thoughts might be hid<br/><br/>"Under green-cover'd bosoms, heaving quick<br/>Beneath quick thoughts; while they grew red with shame,<br/>And gazed down at their feet: while I felt sick,<br/>And almost shriek'd if one should call my name.<br/><br/>"The thrushes sang in the lone garden there:<br/>But where you were the birds were scared I trow:<br/>Clanging of arms about pavilions fair,<br/>Mixed with the knights' laughs; there, as I well know,<br/><br/>"Rode Launcelot, the king of all the band,<br/>And scowling Gauwaine, like the night in day,<br/>And handsome Gareth, with his great white hand<br/>Curl'd round the helm-crest, ere he join'd the fray;<br/><br/>"And merry Dinadan with sharp dark face,<br/>All true knights loved to see; and in the fight<br/>Great Tristram, and though helmed you could trace<br/>In all his bearing the frank noble knight;<br/><br/>"And by him Palomydes, helmet off,<br/>He fought, his face brush'd by his hair,<br/>Red heavy swinging hair; he fear'd a scoff<br/>So overmuch, though what true knight would dare<br/><br/>"To mock that face, fretted with useless care,<br/>And bitter useless striving after love?<br/>O Palomydes, with much honour bear<br/>Beast Glatysaunt upon your shield, above<br/><br/>"Your helm that hides the swinging of your hair,<br/>And think of Iseult, as your sword drives through<br/>Much mail and plate: O God, let me be there<br/>A little time, as I was long ago!<br/><br/>"Because stout Gareth lets his spear fall low,<br/>Gauwaine and Launcelot, and Dinadan<br/>Are helm'd and waiting; let the trumpets go!<br/>Bend over, ladies, to see all you can!<br/><br/>"Clench teeth, dames, yea, clasp hands, for Gareth's spear<br/>Throws Kay from out his saddle, like a stone<br/>From a castle-window when the foe draws near:<br/>'Iseult!' Sir Dinadan rolleth overthrown.<br/><br/>"'Iseult!' again: the pieces of each spear<br/>Fly fathoms up, and both the great steeds reel;<br/>'Tristram for Iseult!' 'Iseult!' and 'Guenevere!'<br/>The ladies' names bite verily like steel.<br/><br/>"They bite: bite me, Lord God! I shall go mad,<br/>Or else die kissing him, he is so pale,<br/>He thinks me mad already, O bad! bad!<br/>Let me lie down a little while and wail."<br/><br/>"No longer so, rise up, I pray you, love,<br/>And slay me really, then we shall be heal'd,<br/>Perchance, in the aftertime by God above."<br/>"Banner of Arthur, with black-bended shield<br/><br/>"Sinister-wise across the fair gold ground!<br/>Here let me tell you what a knight you are,<br/>O sword and shield of Arthur! you are found<br/>A crooked sword, I think, that leaves a scar<br/><br/>"On the bearer's arm, so be he thinks it straight,<br/>Twisted Malay's crease beautiful blue-grey,<br/>Poison'd with sweet fruit; as he found too late,<br/>My husband Arthur, on some bitter day!<br/><br/>"O sickle cutting hemlock the day long!<br/>That the husbandman across his shoulder hangs,<br/>And, going homeward about evensong,<br/>Dies the next morning, struck through by the fangs!<br/><br/>"Banner, and sword, and shield, you dare not die,<br/>Lest you meet Arthur in the other world,<br/>And, knowing who you are, he pass you by,<br/>Taking short turns that he may watch you curl'd,<br/><br/>"Body and face and limbs in agony,<br/>Lest he weep presently and go away,<br/>Saying: 'I loved him once,' with a sad sigh,<br/>Now I have slain him, Lord, let me go too, I pray.<br/><br/>[Launcelot falls.]<br/><br/>"Alas! alas! I know not what to do,<br/>If I run fast it is perchance that I<br/>May fall and stun myself, much better so,<br/>Never, never again! not even when I die."<br/><br/>[LAUNCELOT, on awaking.]<br/><br/>"I stretch'd my hands towards her and fell down,<br/>How long I lay in swoon I cannot tell:<br/>My head and hands were bleeding from the stone,<br/>When I rose up, also I heard a bell."
