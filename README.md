# üíÆ The Princess (part 7) by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    So was their sanctuary violated,<br/>So their fair college turned to hospital;<br/>At first with all confusion: by and by<br/>Sweet order lived again with other laws:<br/>A kindlier influence reigned; and everywhere<br/>Low voices with the ministering hand<br/>Hung round the sick: the maidens came, they talked,<br/>They sang, they read: till she not fair began<br/>To gather light, and she that was, became<br/>Her former beauty treble; and to and fro<br/>With books, with flowers, with Angel offices,<br/>Like creatures native unto gracious act,<br/>And in their own clear element, they moved.<br/><br/>But sadness on the soul of Ida fell,<br/>And hatred of her weakness, blent with shame.<br/>Old studies failed; seldom she spoke: but oft<br/>Clomb to the roofs, and gazed alone for hours<br/>On that disastrous leaguer, swarms of men<br/>Darkening her female field: void was her use,<br/>And she as one that climbs a peak to gaze<br/>O'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud<br/>Drag inward from the deeps, a wall of night,<br/>Blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore,<br/>And suck the blinding splendour from the sand,<br/>And quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn<br/>Expunge the world: so fared she gazing there;<br/>So blackened all her world in secret, blank<br/>And waste it seemed and vain; till down she came,<br/>And found fair peace once more among the sick.<br/><br/>And twilight dawned; and morn by morn the lark<br/>Shot up and shrilled in flickering gyres, but I<br/>Lay silent in the muffled cage of life:<br/>And twilight gloomed; and broader-grown the bowers<br/>Drew the great night into themselves, and Heaven,<br/>Star after Star, arose and fell; but I,<br/>Deeper than those weird doubts could reach me, lay<br/>Quite sundered from the moving Universe,<br/>Nor knew what eye was on me, nor the hand<br/>That nursed me, more than infants in their sleep.<br/><br/>But Psyche tended Florian: with her oft,<br/>Melissa came; for Blanche had gone, but left<br/>Her child among us, willing she should keep<br/>Court-favour: here and there the small bright head,<br/>A light of healing, glanced about the couch,<br/>Or through the parted silks the tender face<br/>Peeped, shining in upon the wounded man<br/>With blush and smile, a medicine in themselves<br/>To wile the length from languorous hours, and draw<br/>The sting from pain; nor seemed it strange that soon<br/>He rose up whole, and those fair charities<br/>Joined at her side; nor stranger seemed that hears<br/>So gentle, so employed, should close in love,<br/>Than when two dewdrops on the petals shake<br/>To the same sweet air, and tremble deeper down,<br/>And slip at once all-fragrant into one.<br/><br/>Less prosperously the second suit obtained<br/>At first with Psyche. Not though Blanche had sworn<br/>That after that dark night among the fields<br/>She needs must wed him for her own good name;<br/>Not though he built upon the babe restored;<br/>Nor though she liked him, yielded she, but feared<br/>To incense the Head once more; till on a day<br/>When Cyril pleaded, Ida came behind<br/>Seen but of Psyche: on her foot she hung<br/>A moment, and she heard, at which her face<br/>A little flushed, and she past on; but each<br/>Assumed from thence a half-consent involved<br/>In stillness, plighted troth, and were at peace.<br/><br/>Nor only these: Love in the sacred halls<br/>Held carnival at will, and flying struck<br/>With showers of random sweet on maid and man.<br/>Nor did her father cease to press my claim,<br/>Nor did mine own, now reconciled; nor yet<br/>Did those twin-brothers, risen again and whole;<br/>Nor Arac, satiate with his victory.<br/><br/>But I lay still, and with me oft she sat:<br/>Then came a change; for sometimes I would catch<br/>Her hand in wild delirium, gripe it hard,<br/>And fling it like a viper off, and shriek<br/>'You are not Ida;' clasp it once again,<br/>And call her Ida, though I knew her not,<br/>And call her sweet, as if in irony,<br/>And call her hard and cold which seemed a truth:<br/>And still she feared that I should lose my mind,<br/>And often she believed that I should die:<br/>Till out of long frustration of her care,<br/>And pensive tendance in the all-weary noons,<br/>And watches in the dead, the dark, when clocks<br/>Throbbed thunder through the palace floors, or called<br/>On flying Time from all their silver tongues--<br/>And out of memories of her kindlier days,<br/>And sidelong glances at my father's grief,<br/>And at the happy lovers heart in heart--<br/>And out of hauntings of my spoken love,<br/>And lonely listenings to my muttered dream,<br/>And often feeling of the helpless hands,<br/>And wordless broodings on the wasted cheek--<br/>From all a closer interest flourished up,<br/>Tenderness touch by touch, and last, to these,<br/>Love, like an Alpine harebell hung with tears<br/>By some cold morning glacier; frail at first<br/>And feeble, all unconscious of itself,<br/>But such as gathered colour day by day.<br/><br/>Last I woke sane, but well-nigh close to death<br/>For weakness: it was evening: silent light<br/>Slept on the painted walls, wherein were wrought<br/>Two grand designs; for on one side arose<br/>The women up in wild revolt, and stormed<br/>At the Oppian Law. Titanic shapes, they crammed<br/>The forum, and half-crushed among the rest<br/>A dwarf-like Cato cowered. On the other side<br/>Hortensia spoke against the tax; behind,<br/>A train of dames: by axe and eagle sat,<br/>With all their foreheads drawn in Roman scowls,<br/>And half the wolf's-milk curdled in their veins,<br/>The fierce triumvirs; and before them paused<br/>Hortensia pleading: angry was her face.<br/><br/>I saw the forms: I knew not where I was:<br/>They did but look like hollow shows; nor more<br/>Sweet Ida: palm to palm she sat: the dew<br/>Dwelt in her eyes, and softer all her shape<br/>And rounder seemed: I moved: I sighed: a touch<br/>Came round my wrist, and tears upon my hand:<br/>Then all for languor and self-pity ran<br/>Mine down my face, and with what life I had,<br/>And like a flower that cannot all unfold,<br/>So drenched it is with tempest, to the sun,<br/>Yet, as it may, turns toward him, I on her<br/>Fixt my faint eyes, and uttered whisperingly:<br/><br/>'If you be, what I think you, some sweet dream,<br/>I would but ask you to fulfil yourself:<br/>But if you be that Ida whom I knew,<br/>I ask you nothing: only, if a dream,<br/>Sweet dream, be perfect. I shall die tonight.<br/>Stoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.'<br/><br/>I could no more, but lay like one in trance,<br/>That hears his burial talked of by his friends,<br/>And cannot speak, nor move, nor make one sign,<br/>But lies and dreads his doom. She turned; she paused;<br/>She stooped; and out of languor leapt a cry;<br/>Leapt fiery Passion from the brinks of death;<br/>And I believed that in the living world<br/>My spirit closed with Ida's at the lips;<br/>Till back I fell, and from mine arms she rose<br/>Glowing all over noble shame; and all<br/>Her falser self slipt from her like a robe,<br/>And left her woman, lovelier in her mood<br/>Than in her mould that other, when she came<br/>From barren deeps to conquer all with love;<br/>And down the streaming crystal dropt; and she<br/>Far-fleeted by the purple island-sides,<br/>Naked, a double light in air and wave,<br/>To meet her Graces, where they decked her out<br/>For worship without end; nor end of mine,<br/>Stateliest, for thee! but mute she glided forth,<br/>Nor glanced behind her, and I sank and slept,<br/>Filled through and through with Love, a happy sleep.<br/><br/>Deep in the night I woke: she, near me, held<br/>A volume of the Poets of her land:<br/>There to herself, all in low tones, she read.<br/><br/><br/>'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;<br/>Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;<br/>Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:<br/>The fire-fly wakens: wake thou with me.<br/><br/>Now droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,<br/>And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.<br/><br/>Now lies the Earth all Dana√´ to the stars,<br/>And all thy heart lies open unto me.<br/><br/>Now lies the silent meteor on, and leaves<br/>A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.<br/><br/>Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,<br/>And slips into the bosom of the lake:<br/>So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip<br/>Into my bosom and be lost in me.'<br/><br/><br/>I heard her turn the page; she found a small<br/>Sweet Idyl, and once more, as low, she read:<br/><br/><br/>'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:<br/>What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)<br/>In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?<br/>But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease<br/>To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,<br/>To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;<br/>And come, for love is of the valley, come,<br/>For love is of the valley, come thou down<br/>And find him; by the happy threshold, he,<br/>Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,<br/>Or red with spirted purple of the vats,<br/>Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk<br/>With Death and Morning on the silver horns,<br/>Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,<br/>Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,<br/>That huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls<br/>To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:<br/>But follow; let the torrent dance thee down<br/>To find him in the valley; let the wild<br/>Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave<br/>The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill<br/>Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,<br/>That like a broken purpose waste in air:<br/>So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales<br/>Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth<br/>Arise to thee; the children call, and I<br/>Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,<br/>Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;<br/>Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,<br/>The moan of doves in immemorial elms,<br/>And murmuring of innumerable bees.'<br/><br/><br/>So she low-toned; while with shut eyes I lay<br/>Listening; then looked. Pale was the perfect face;<br/>The bosom with long sighs laboured; and meek<br/>Seemed the full lips, and mild the luminous eyes,<br/>And the voice trembled and the hand. She said<br/>Brokenly, that she knew it, she had failed<br/>In sweet humility; had failed in all;<br/>That all her labour was but as a block<br/>Left in the quarry; but she still were loth,<br/>She still were loth to yield herself to one<br/>That wholly scorned to help their equal rights<br/>Against the sons of men, and barbarous laws.<br/>She prayed me not to judge their cause from her<br/>That wronged it, sought far less for truth than power<br/>In knowledge: something wild within her breast,<br/>A greater than all knowledge, beat her down.<br/>And she had nursed me there from week to week:<br/>Much had she learnt in little time. In part<br/>It was ill counsel had misled the girl<br/>To vex true hearts: yet was she but a girl--<br/>'Ah fool, and made myself a Queen of farce!<br/>When comes another such? never, I think,<br/>Till the Sun drop, dead, from the signs.'<br/>Her voice<br/>choked, and her forehead sank upon her hands,<br/>And her great heart through all the faultful Past<br/>Went sorrowing in a pause I dared not break;<br/>Till notice of a change in the dark world<br/>Was lispt about the acacias, and a bird,<br/>That early woke to feed her little ones,<br/>Sent from a dewy breast a cry for light:<br/>She moved, and at her feet the volume fell.<br/><br/>'Blame not thyself too much,' I said, 'nor blame<br/>Too much the sons of men and barbarous laws;<br/>These were the rough ways of the world till now.<br/>Henceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know<br/>The woman's cause is man's: they rise or sink<br/>Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free:<br/>For she that out of Lethe scales with man<br/>The shining steps of Nature, shares with man<br/>His nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,<br/>Stays all the fair young planet in her hands--<br/>If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,<br/>How shall men grow? but work no more alone!<br/>Our place is much: as far as in us lies<br/>We two will serve them both in aiding her--<br/>Will clear away the parasitic forms<br/>That seem to keep her up but drag her down--<br/>Will leave her space to burgeon out of all<br/>Within her--let her make herself her own<br/>To give or keep, to live and learn and be<br/>All that not harms distinctive womanhood.<br/>For woman is not undevelopt man,<br/>But diverse: could we make her as the man,<br/>Sweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this,<br/>Not like to like, but like in difference.<br/>Yet in the long years liker must they grow;<br/>The man be more of woman, she of man;<br/>He gain in sweetness and in moral height,<br/>Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;<br/>She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,<br/>Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;<br/>Till at the last she set herself to man,<br/>Like perfect music unto noble words;<br/>And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,<br/>Sit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,<br/>Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,<br/>Self-reverent each and reverencing each,<br/>Distinct in individualities,<br/>But like each other even as those who love.<br/>Then comes the statelier Eden back to men:<br/>Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm:<br/>Then springs the crowning race of humankind.<br/>May these things be!'<br/>Sighing she spoke 'I fear<br/>They will not.'<br/>'Dear, but let us type them now<br/>In our own lives, and this proud watchword rest<br/>Of equal; seeing either sex alone<br/>Is half itself, and in true marriage lies<br/>Nor equal, nor unequal: each fulfils<br/>Defect in each, and always thought in thought,<br/>Purpose in purpose, will in will, they grow,<br/>The single pure and perfect animal,<br/>The two-celled heart beating, with one full stroke,<br/>Life.'<br/>And again sighing she spoke: 'A dream<br/>That once was mind! what woman taught you this?'<br/><br/>'Alone,' I said, 'from earlier than I know,<br/>Immersed in rich foreshadowings of the world,<br/>I loved the woman: he, that doth not, lives<br/>A drowning life, besotted in sweet self,<br/>Or pines in sad experience worse than death,<br/>Or keeps his winged affections clipt with crime:<br/>Yet was there one through whom I loved her, one<br/>Not learn√®d, save in gracious household ways,<br/>Not perfect, nay, but full of tender wants,<br/>No Angel, but a dearer being, all dipt<br/>In Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,<br/>Interpreter between the Gods and men,<br/>Who looked all native to her place, and yet<br/>On tiptoe seemed to touch upon a sphere<br/>Too gross to tread, and all male minds perforce<br/>Swayed to her from their orbits as they moved,<br/>And girdled her with music. Happy he<br/>With such a mother! faith in womankind<br/>Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high<br/>Comes easy to him, and though he trip and fall<br/>He shall not blind his soul with clay.'<br/>'But I,'<br/>Said Ida, tremulously, 'so all unlike--<br/>It seems you love to cheat yourself with words:<br/>This mother is your model. I have heard<br/>of your strange doubts: they well might be: I seem<br/>A mockery to my own self. Never, Prince;<br/>You cannot love me.'<br/>'Nay but thee' I said<br/>'From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes,<br/>Ere seen I loved, and loved thee seen, and saw<br/>Thee woman through the crust of iron moods<br/>That masked thee from men's reverence up, and forced<br/>Sweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood: now,<br/>Given back to life, to life indeed, through thee,<br/>Indeed I love: the new day comes, the light<br/>Dearer for night, as dearer thou for faults<br/>Lived over: lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead,<br/>My haunting sense of hollow shows: the change,<br/>This truthful change in thee has killed it. Dear,<br/>Look up, and let thy nature strike on mine,<br/>Like yonder morning on the blind half-world;<br/>Approach and fear not; breathe upon my brows;<br/>In that fine air I tremble, all the past<br/>Melts mist-like into this bright hour, and this<br/>Is morn to more, and all the rich to-come<br/>Reels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels<br/>Athwart the smoke of burning weeds. Forgive me,<br/>I waste my heart in signs: let be. My bride,<br/>My wife, my life. O we will walk this world,<br/>Yoked in all exercise of noble end,<br/>And so through those dark gates across the wild<br/>That no man knows. Indeed I love thee: come,<br/>Yield thyself up: my hopes and thine are one:<br/>Accomplish thou my manhood and thyself;<br/>Lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me.'
