# üíÆ Ode to a Lady Whose Lover Was Killed by a Ball, Which at the Same Time Shivered a Portrait Next His Heart by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
     _On peut trouver des femmes qui n'ont jamais eu de galanterie, mais<br/> il est rare d'en trouver qui n'en aient jamais eu<br/> qu'une_.--[_R√©flexions_ ... du Duc de la Rochefoucauld, No.<br/> lxxiii.<br/><br/>  Lady! in whose heroic port<br/>And Beauty, Victor even of Time,<br/>  And haughty lineaments, appear<br/>  Much that is awful, more that's dear--<br/>  Wherever human hearts resort<br/>  _There_ must have been for thee a Court,<br/>  And Thou by acclamation Queen,<br/>  Where never Sovereign yet had been.<br/>That eye so soft, and yet severe,<br/>  Perchance might look on Love as Crime;<br/>And yet--regarding thee more near--<br/>The traces of an unshed tear<br/>  Compressed back to the heart,<br/>And mellowed Sadness in thine air,<br/>Which shows that Love hath once been there,<br/>To those who watch thee will disclose<br/>More than ten thousand tomes of woes<br/>  Wrung from the vain Romancer's art.<br/>With thee how proudly Love hath dwelt!<br/>His full Divinity was felt,<br/>Maddening the heart he could not melt,<br/>  Till Guilt became Sublime;<br/>But never yet did Beauty's Zone<br/>For him surround a lovelier throne,<br/>Than in that bosom once his own:<br/>  And he the Sun and Thou the Clime<br/>Together must have made a Heaven<br/>For which the Future would be given.<br/><br/>And thou hast loved--Oh! not in vain!<br/>  And not as common Mortals love.<br/>    The Fruit of Fire is Ashes,<br/>    The Ocean's tempest dashes<br/>Wrecks and the dead upon the rocky shore:<br/>True Passion must the all-searching changes prove,<br/>  The Agony of Pleasure and of Pain,<br/>  Till Nothing but the Bitterness remain;<br/>  And the Heart's Spectre flitting through the brain<br/>Scoffs at the Exorcism which would remove.<br/><br/>And where is He thou lovedst? in the tomb,<br/>  Where should the happy Lover be!<br/>For him could Time unfold a brighter doom,<br/>  Or offer aught like thee?<br/>He in the thickest battle died,<br/>  Where Death is Pride;<br/>And _Thou_ his widow--not his bride,<br/>  Wer't not more free--<br/>_Here_ where all love, till Love is made<br/>  A bondage or a trade,<br/>_Here_--thou so redolent of Beauty,<br/>In whom Caprice had seemed a duty,<br/>_Thou_, who could'st trample and despise<br/>The holiest chain of human ties<br/>For him, the dear One in thine eyes,<br/>  Broke it no more.<br/>Thy heart was withered to it's Core,<br/>It's hopes, it's fears, it's feelings o'er:<br/>Thy Blood grew Ice when _his_ was shed,<br/>And Thou the Vestal of the Dead.<br/><br/>Thy Lover died, as All<br/>  Who truly love should die;<br/>For such are worthy in the fight to fall<br/>  Triumphantly.<br/>No Cuirass o'er that glowing heart<br/>The deadly bullet turned apart:<br/>Love had bestowed a richer Mail,<br/>  Like Thetis on her Son;<br/>But hers at last was vain, and thine could fail--<br/>  The hero's and the lover's race was run.<br/>Thy worshipped portrait, thy sweet face,<br/>_Without_ that bosom kept it's place<br/>  As Thou _within_.<br/>Oh! enviously destined Ball!<br/>Shivering thine imaged charms and all<br/>  Those Charms would win:<br/>Together pierced, the fatal Stroke hath gored<br/>Votary and Shrine, the adoring and the adored.<br/>  That Heart's last throb was thine, that blood<br/>  Baptized thine Image in it's flood,<br/>  And gushing from the fount of Faith<br/>  O'erflowed with Passion even in Death,<br/>Constant to thee as in it's hour<br/>Of rapture in the secret bower.<br/>Thou too hast kept thy plight full well,<br/>As many a baffled Heart can tell.
