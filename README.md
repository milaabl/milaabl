<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Ode From the French by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    We do not curse thee, Waterloo!<br/>Though Freedom's blood thy plain bedew;<br/>There 'twas shed, but is not sunk--<br/>Rising from each gory trunk,<br/>Like the water-spout from ocean,<br/>With a strong and growing motion--<br/>It soars, and mingles in the air,<br/>With that of lost La B√©doy√®re--<br/>With that of him whose honoured grave<br/>Contains the "bravest of the brave."<br/>A crimson cloud it spreads and glows,<br/>But shall return to whence it rose;<br/>When 'tis full 'twill burst asunder--<br/>Never yet was heard such thunder<br/>As then shall shake the world with wonder--<br/>Never yet was seen such lightning<br/>As o'er heaven shall then be bright'ning!<br/>Like the Wormwood Star foretold<br/>  By the sainted Seer of old,<br/>Show'ring down a fiery flood,<br/>Turning rivers into blood.<br/><br/>The Chief has fallen, but not by you,<br/>Vanquishers of Waterloo!<br/>When the soldier citizen<br/>Swayed not o'er his fellow-men--<br/>Save in deeds that led them on<br/>Where Glory smiled on Freedom's son--<br/>Who, of all the despots banded,<br/>  With that youthful chief competed?<br/>  Who could boast o'er France defeated,<br/>Till lone Tyranny commanded?<br/>Till, goaded by Ambition's sting,<br/>The Hero sunk into the King?<br/>Then he fell:--so perish all,<br/>Who would men by man enthral!<br/><br/>And thou, too, of the snow-white plume!<br/>Whose realm refused thee ev'n a tomb;<br/>Better hadst thou still been leading<br/>France o'er hosts of hirelings bleeding,<br/>Than sold thyself to death and shame<br/>For a meanly royal name;<br/>Such as he of Naples wears,<br/>Who thy blood-bought title bears.<br/>Little didst thou deem, when dashing<br/>  On thy war-horse through the ranks.<br/>  Like a stream which burst its banks,<br/>While helmets cleft, and sabres clashing,<br/>Shone and shivered fast around thee--<br/>Of the fate at last which found thee:<br/>Was that haughty plume laid low<br/>By a slave's dishonest blow?<br/>Once--as the Moon sways o'er the tide,<br/>It rolled in air, the warrior's guide;<br/>Through the smoke-created night<br/>Of the black and sulphurous fight,<br/>The soldier raised his seeking eye<br/>To catch that crest's ascendancy,--<br/>And, as it onward rolling rose,<br/>So moved his heart upon our foes.<br/>There, where death's brief pang was quickest,<br/>And the battle's wreck lay thickest,<br/>Strewed beneath the advancing banner<br/>  Of the eagle's burning crest--<br/>(There with thunder-clouds to fan her,<br/>  _Who_ could then her wing arrest--<br/>  Victory beaming from her breast?)<br/>While the broken line enlarging<br/>  Fell, or fled along the plain;<br/>There be sure was Murat charging!<br/>  There he ne'er shall charge again!<br/><br/>O'er glories gone the invaders march,<br/>Weeps Triumph o'er each levelled arch--<br/>But let Freedom rejoice,<br/>With her heart in her voice;<br/>But, her hand on her sword,<br/>Doubly shall she be adored;<br/>France hath twice too well been taught<br/>The "moral lesson" dearly bought--<br/>Her safety sits not on a throne,<br/>With Capet or Napoleon!<br/>But in equal rights and laws,<br/>Hearts and hands in one great cause--<br/>Freedom, such as God hath given<br/>Unto all beneath his heaven,<br/>With their breath, and from their birth,<br/>Though guilt would sweep it from the earth;<br/>With a fierce and lavish hand<br/>Scattering nations' wealth like sand;<br/>Pouring nations' blood like water,<br/>In imperial seas of slaughter!<br/><br/>But the heart and the mind,<br/>And the voice of mankind,<br/>Shall arise in communion--<br/>And who shall resist that proud union?<br/>The time is past when swords subdued--<br/>Man may die--the soul's renewed:<br/>Even in this low world of care<br/>Freedom ne'er shall want an heir;<br/>Millions breathe but to inherit<br/>Her for ever bounding spirit--<br/>When once more her hosts assemble,<br/>Tyrants shall believe and tremble--<br/>Smile they at this idle threat?<br/>Crimson tears will follow yet.
