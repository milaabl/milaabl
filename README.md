# üíÆ Paradise Regained: The Second Book by *John Milton*

<p>
    Meanwhile the new-baptized, who yet remained<br/>At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen<br/>Him whom they heard so late expressly called<br/>Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared,<br/>And on that high authority had believed,<br/>And with him talked, and with him lodged‚ÄîI mean<br/>Andrew and Simon, famous after known,<br/>With others, though in Holy Writ not named‚Äî<br/>Now missing him, their joy so lately found,<br/>So lately found and so abruptly gone,<br/>Began to doubt, and doubted many days,<br/>And, as the days increased, increased their doubt.<br/>Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn,<br/>And for a time caught up to God, as once<br/>Moses was in the Mount and missing long,<br/>And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels<br/>Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.<br/>Therefore, as those young prophets then with care<br/>Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these<br/>Nigh to Bethabara‚Äîin Jericho<br/>The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old,<br/>Machaerus, and each town or city walled<br/>On this side the broad lake Genezaret,<br/>Or in Peraea‚Äîbut returned in vain.<br/>Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek,<br/>Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play,<br/>Plain fishermen (no greater men them call),<br/>Close in a cottage low together got,<br/>Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:‚Äî<br/>  "Alas, from what high hope to what relapse<br/>Unlooked for are we fallen!  Our eyes beheld<br/>Messiah certainly now come, so long<br/>Expected of our fathers; we have heard<br/>His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth.<br/>'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand;<br/>The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:'<br/>Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned<br/>Into perplexity and new amaze.<br/>For whither is he gone? what accident<br/>Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire<br/>After appearance, and again prolong<br/>Our expectation?  God of Israel,<br/>Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.<br/>Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress<br/>Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust<br/>They have exalted, and behind them cast<br/>All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate<br/>Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!<br/>But let us wait; thus far He hath performed‚Äî<br/>Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him<br/>By his great Prophet pointed at and shown<br/>In public, and with him we have conversed.<br/>Let us be glad of this, and all our fears<br/>Lay on his providence; He will not fail,<br/>Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall‚Äî<br/>Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence:<br/>Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return."<br/>  Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume<br/>To find whom at the first they found unsought.<br/>But to his mother Mary, when she saw<br/>Others returned from baptism, not her Son,<br/>Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none,<br/>Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure,<br/>Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised<br/>Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:‚Äî<br/>  "Oh, what avails me now that honour high,<br/>To have conceived of God, or that salute,<br/>'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!'<br/>While I to sorrows am no less advanced,<br/>And fears as eminent above the lot<br/>Of other women, by the birth I bore:<br/>In such a season born, when scarce a shed<br/>Could be obtained to shelter him or me<br/>From the bleak air?  A stable was our warmth,<br/>A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly<br/>Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king<br/>Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled<br/>With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.<br/>From Egypt home returned, in Nazareth<br/>Hath been our dwelling many years; his life<br/>Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,<br/>Little suspicious to any king.  But now,<br/>Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear,<br/>By John the Baptist, and in public shewn,<br/>Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice,<br/>I looked for some great change.  To honour? no;<br/>But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold,<br/>That to the fall and rising he should be<br/>Of many in Israel, and to a sign<br/>Spoken against‚Äîthat through my very soul<br/>A sword shall pierce.  This is my favoured lot,<br/>My exaltation to afflictions high!<br/>Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!<br/>I will not argue that, nor will repine.<br/>But where delays he now?  Some great intent<br/>Conceals him.  When twelve years he scarce had seen,<br/>I lost him, but so found as well I saw<br/>He could not lose himself, but went about<br/>His Father's business.  What he meant I mused‚Äî<br/>Since understand; much more his absence now<br/>Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.<br/>But I to wait with patience am inured;<br/>My heart hath been a storehouse long of things<br/>And sayings laid up, pretending strange events."<br/>  Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind<br/>Recalling what remarkably had passed<br/>Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts<br/>Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling:<br/>The while her Son, tracing the desert wild,<br/>Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,<br/>Into himself descended, and at once<br/>All his great work to come before him set‚Äî<br/>How to begin, how to accomplish best<br/>His end of being on Earth, and mission high.<br/>For Satan, with sly preface to return,<br/>Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone<br/>Up to the middle region of thick air,<br/>Where all his Potentates in council sate.<br/>There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy,<br/>Solicitous and blank, he thus began:‚Äî<br/>  "Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones‚Äî<br/>Daemonian Spirits now, from the element<br/>Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called<br/>Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath<br/>(So may we hold our place and these mild seats<br/>Without new trouble!)‚Äîsuch an enemy<br/>Is risen to invade us, who no less<br/>Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.<br/>I, as I undertook, and with the vote<br/>Consenting in full frequence was impowered,<br/>Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find<br/>Far other labour to be undergone<br/>Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men,<br/>Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell,<br/>However to this Man inferior far‚Äî<br/>If he be Man by mother's side, at least<br/>With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned,<br/>Perfections absolute, graces divine,<br/>And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.<br/>Therefore I am returned, lest confidence<br/>Of my success with Eve in Paradise<br/>Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure<br/>Of like succeeding here.  I summon all<br/>Rather to be in readiness with hand<br/>Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst<br/>Thought none my equal, now be overmatched."<br/>  So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all<br/>With clamour was assured their utmost aid<br/>At his command; when from amidst them rose<br/>Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,<br/>The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,<br/>The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:‚Äî<br/>  "Set women in his eye and in his walk,<br/>Among daughters of men the fairest found.<br/>Many are in each region passing fair<br/>As the noon sky, more like to goddesses<br/>Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet,<br/>Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues<br/>Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild<br/>And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,<br/>Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw<br/>Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.<br/>Such object hath the power to soften and tame<br/>Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow,<br/>Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,<br/>Draw out with credulous desire, and lead<br/>At will the manliest, resolutest breast,<br/>As the magnetic hardest iron draws.<br/>Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart<br/>Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,<br/>And made him bow, to the gods of his wives."<br/>  To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:‚Äî<br/>"Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st<br/>All others by thyself.  Because of old<br/>Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring<br/>Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace,<br/>None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys.<br/>Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew,<br/>False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth,<br/>Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,<br/>And coupled with them, and begot a race.<br/>Have we not seen, or by relation heard,<br/>In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st,<br/>In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side,<br/>In valley or green meadow, to waylay<br/>Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene,<br/>Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa,<br/>Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more<br/>Too long‚Äîthen lay'st thy scapes on names adored,<br/>Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,<br/>Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan?  But these haunts<br/>Delight not all.  Among the sons of men<br/>How many have with a smile made small account<br/>Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned<br/>All her assaults, on worthier things intent!<br/>Remember that Pellean conqueror,<br/>A youth, how all the beauties of the East<br/>He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed;<br/>How he surnamed of Africa dismissed,<br/>In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.<br/>For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full<br/>Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond<br/>Higher design than to enjoy his state;<br/>Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.<br/>But he whom we attempt is wiser far<br/>Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,<br/>Made and set wholly on the accomplishment<br/>Of greatest things.  What woman will you find,<br/>Though of this age the wonder and the fame,<br/>On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye<br/>Of fond desire?  Or should she, confident,<br/>As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne,<br/>Descend with all her winning charms begirt<br/>To enamour, as the zone of Venus once<br/>Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell),<br/>How would one look from his majestic brow,<br/>Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill,<br/>Discountenance her despised, and put to rout<br/>All her array, her female pride deject,<br/>Or turn to reverent awe!  For Beauty stands<br/>In the admiration only of weak minds<br/>Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes<br/>Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,<br/>At every sudden slighting quite abashed.<br/>Therefore with manlier objects we must try<br/>His constancy‚Äîwith such as have more shew<br/>Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise<br/>(Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked);<br/>Or that which only seems to satisfy<br/>Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.<br/>And now I know he hungers, where no food<br/>Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness:<br/>The rest commit to me; I shall let pass<br/>No advantage, and his strength as oft assay."<br/>  He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim;<br/>Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band<br/>Of Spirits likest to himself in guile,<br/>To be at hand and at his beck appear,<br/>If cause were to unfold some active scene<br/>Of various persons, each to know his part;<br/>Then to the desert takes with these his flight,<br/>Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God,<br/>After forty days' fasting, had remained,<br/>Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:‚Äî<br/>  "Where will this end?  Four times ten days I have passed<br/>Wandering this woody maze, and human food<br/>Nor tasted, nor had appetite.  That fast<br/>To virtue I impute not, or count part<br/>Of what I suffer here.  If nature need not,<br/>Or God support nature without repast,<br/>Though needing, what praise is it to endure?<br/>But now I feel I hunger; which declares<br/>Nature hath need of what she asks.  Yet God<br/>Can satisfy that need some other way,<br/>Though hunger still remain.  So it remain<br/>Without this body's wasting, I content me,<br/>And from the sting of famine fear no harm;<br/>Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed<br/>Me hungering more to do my Father's will."<br/>  It was the hour of night, when thus the Son<br/>Communed in silent walk, then laid him down<br/>Under the hospitable covert nigh<br/>Of trees thick interwoven.  There he slept,<br/>And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream,<br/>Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet.<br/>Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood,<br/>And saw the ravens with their horny beaks<br/>Food to Elijah bringing even and morn‚Äî<br/>Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought;<br/>He saw the Prophet also, how he fled<br/>Into the desert, and how there he slept<br/>Under a juniper‚Äîthen how, awaked,<br/>He found his supper on the coals prepared,<br/>And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,<br/>And eat the second time after repose,<br/>The strength whereof sufficed him forty days:<br/>Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,<br/>Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.<br/>Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark<br/>Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry<br/>The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.<br/>As lightly from his grassy couch up rose<br/>Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;<br/>Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.<br/>Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,<br/>From whose high top to ken the prospect round,<br/>If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;<br/>But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw‚Äî<br/>Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,<br/>With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.<br/>Thither he bent his way, determined there<br/>To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade<br/>High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown,<br/>That opened in the midst a woody scene;<br/>Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art),<br/>And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt<br/>Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs.  He viewed it round;<br/>When suddenly a man before him stood,<br/>Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,<br/>As one in city or court or palace bred,<br/>And with fair speech these words to him addressed:‚Äî<br/>  "With granted leave officious I return,<br/>But much more wonder that the Son of God<br/>In this wild solitude so long should bide,<br/>Of all things destitute, and, well I know,<br/>Not without hunger.  Others of some note,<br/>As story tells, have trod this wilderness:<br/>The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son,<br/>Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief<br/>By a providing Angel; all the race<br/>Of Israel here had famished, had not God<br/>Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold,<br/>Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed<br/>Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.<br/>Of thee those forty days none hath regard,<br/>Forty and more deserted here indeed."<br/>  To whom thus Jesus:‚Äî"What conclud'st thou hence?<br/>They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none."<br/>  "How hast thou hunger then?" Satan replied.<br/>"Tell me, if food were now before thee set,<br/>Wouldst thou not eat?"  "Thereafter as I like<br/>the giver," answered Jesus.  "Why should that<br/>Cause thy refusal?" said the subtle Fiend.<br/>"Hast thou not right to all created things?<br/>Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee<br/>Duty and service, nor to stay till bid,<br/>But tender all their power?  Nor mention I<br/>Meats by the law unclean, or offered first<br/>To idols‚Äîthose young Daniel could refuse;<br/>Nor proffered by an enemy‚Äîthough who<br/>Would scruple that, with want oppressed?  Behold,<br/>Nature ashamed, or, better to express,<br/>Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed<br/>From all the elements her choicest store,<br/>To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord<br/>With honour.  Only deign to sit and eat."<br/>  He spake no dream; for, as his words had end,<br/>Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld,<br/>In ample space under the broadest shade,<br/>A table richly spread in regal mode,<br/>With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort<br/>And savour‚Äîbeasts of chase, or fowl of game,<br/>In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled,<br/>Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore,<br/>Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin,<br/>And exquisitest name, for which was drained<br/>Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast.<br/>Alas! how simple, to these cates compared,<br/>Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!<br/>And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,<br/>That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood<br/>Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue<br/>Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more,<br/>Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood,<br/>Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades<br/>With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn,<br/>And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed<br/>Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since<br/>Of faery damsels met in forest wide<br/>By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,<br/>Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.<br/>And all the while harmonious airs were heard<br/>Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds<br/>Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned<br/>From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells.<br/>Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now<br/>His invitation earnestly renewed:‚Äî<br/>  "What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?<br/>These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict<br/>Defends the touching of these viands pure;<br/>Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil,<br/>But life preserves, destroys life's enemy,<br/>Hunger, with sweet restorative delight.<br/>All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs,<br/>Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay<br/>Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord.<br/>What doubt'st thou, Son of God?  Sit down and eat."<br/>  To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:‚Äî<br/>"Said'st thou not that to all things I had right?<br/>And who withholds my power that right to use?<br/>Shall I receive by gift what of my own,<br/>When and where likes me best, I can command?<br/>I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,<br/>Command a table in this wilderness,<br/>And call swift flights of Angels ministrant,<br/>Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend:<br/>Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence<br/>In vain, where no acceptance it can find?<br/>And with my hunger what hast thou to do?<br/>Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,<br/>And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles."<br/>  To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:‚Äî<br/>"That I have also power to give thou seest;<br/>If of that power I bring thee voluntary<br/>What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased,<br/>And rather opportunely in this place<br/>Chose to impart to thy apparent need,<br/>Why shouldst thou not accept it?  But I see<br/>What I can do or offer is suspect.<br/>Of these things others quickly will dispose,<br/>Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil."  With that<br/>Both table and provision vanished quite,<br/>With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard;<br/>Only the importune Tempter still remained,<br/>And with these words his temptation pursued:‚Äî<br/>  "By hunger, that each other creature tames,<br/>Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved;<br/>Thy temperance, invincible besides,<br/>For no allurement yields to appetite;<br/>And all thy heart is set on high designs,<br/>High actions.  But wherewith to be achieved?<br/>Great acts require great means of enterprise;<br/>Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth,<br/>A carpenter thy father known, thyself<br/>Bred up in poverty and straits at home,<br/>Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit.<br/>Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire<br/>To greatness? whence authority deriv'st?<br/>What followers, what retinue canst thou gain,<br/>Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude,<br/>Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost?<br/>Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms.<br/>What raised Antipater the Edomite,<br/>And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne,<br/>Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends?<br/>Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,<br/>Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap‚Äî<br/>Not difficult, if thou hearken to me.<br/>Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand;<br/>They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,<br/>While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want."<br/>  To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:‚Äî<br/>"Yet wealth without these three is impotent<br/>To gain dominion, or to keep it gained‚Äî<br/>Witness those ancient empires of the earth,<br/>In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved;<br/>But men endued with these have oft attained,<br/>In lowest poverty, to highest deeds‚Äî<br/>Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad<br/>Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate<br/>So many ages, and shall yet regain<br/>That seat, and reign in Israel without end.<br/>Among the Heathen (for throughout the world<br/>To me is not unknown what hath been done<br/>Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember<br/>Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?<br/>For I esteem those names of men so poor,<br/>Who could do mighty things, and could contemn<br/>Riches, though offered from the hand of kings.<br/>And what in me seems wanting but that I<br/>May also in this poverty as soon<br/>Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more?<br/>Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools,<br/>The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt<br/>To slacken virtue and abate her edge<br/>Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.<br/>What if with like aversion I reject<br/>Riches and realms!  Yet not for that a crown,<br/>Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns,<br/>Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights,<br/>To him who wears the regal diadem,<br/>When on his shoulders each man's burden lies;<br/>For therein stands the office of a king,<br/>His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise,<br/>That for the public all this weight he bears.<br/>Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules<br/>Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king‚Äî<br/>Which every wise and virtuous man attains;<br/>And who attains not, ill aspires to rule<br/>Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,<br/>Subject himself to anarchy within,<br/>Or lawless passions in him, which he serves.<br/>But to guide nations in the way of truth<br/>By saving doctrine, and from error lead<br/>To know, and, knowing, worship God aright,<br/>Is yet more kingly.  This attracts the soul,<br/>Governs the inner man, the nobler part;<br/>That other o'er the body only reigns,<br/>And oft by force‚Äîwhich to a generous mind<br/>So reigning can be no sincere delight.<br/>Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought<br/>Greater and nobler done, and to lay down<br/>Far more magnanimous, than to assume.<br/>Riches are needless, then, both for themselves,<br/>And for thy reason why they should be sought‚Äî<br/>To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed."
