# üíÆ Childe Harold's Pilgrimage by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>TO IANTHE.<br/><br/>Not in those climes where I have late been straying,<br/>  Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed,<br/>  Not in those visions to the heart displaying<br/>  Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed,<br/>  Hath aught like thee in Truth or Fancy seemed:<br/>  Nor, having seen thee, shall I vainly seek<br/>  To paint those charms which varied as they beamed--<br/>  To such as see thee not my words were weak;<br/>To those who gaze on thee what language could they speak?<br/><br/>Ah! may'st thou ever be what now thou art,<br/>  Nor unbeseem the promise of thy Spring--<br/>  As fair in form, as warm yet pure in heart,<br/>  Love's image upon earth without his wing,<br/>  And guileless beyond Hope's imagining!<br/>  And surely she who now so fondly rears<br/>  Thy youth, in thee, thus hourly brightening,<br/>  Beholds the Rainbow of her future years,<br/>Before whose heavenly hues all Sorrow disappears.<br/><br/>Young Peri of the West!--'tis well for me<br/>  My years already doubly number thine;<br/>  My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee,<br/>  And safely view thy ripening beauties shine;<br/>  Happy, I ne'er shall see them in decline;<br/>  Happier, that, while all younger hearts shall bleed,<br/>  Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign<br/>  To those whose admiration shall succeed,<br/>But mixed with pangs to Love's even loveliest hours decreed.<br/><br/>Oh! let that eye, which, wild as the Gazelle's,<br/>  Now brightly bold or beautifully shy,<br/>  Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,<br/>  Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny<br/>  That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh<br/>  Could I to thee be ever more than friend:<br/>  This much, dear Maid, accord; nor question why<br/>  To one so young my strain I would commend,<br/>But bid me with my wreath one matchless Lily blend.<br/><br/>Such is thy name with this my verse entwined;<br/>  And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast<br/>  On Harold's page, Ianthe's here enshrined<br/>  Shall thus be _first_ beheld, forgotten _last_:<br/>  My days once numbered--should this homage past<br/>  Attract thy fairy fingers near the Lyre<br/>  Of him who hailed thee loveliest, as thou wast--<br/>  Such is the most my Memory may desire;<br/>Though more than Hope can claim, could Friendship less require?<br/><br/>A ROMAUNT.<br/><br/>CANTO THE FIRST. I.<br/><br/>Oh, thou! in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,<br/>  Muse! formed or fabled at the Minstrel's will!<br/>  Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,<br/>  Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred Hill:<br/>  Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;<br/>  Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine,<br/>  Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;<br/>  Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine<br/>To grace so plain a tale--this lowly lay of mine.<br/><br/>Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,<br/>  Who ne in Virtue's ways did take delight;<br/>  But spent his days in riot most uncouth,<br/>  And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.<br/>  Ah me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,<br/>  Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;<br/>  Few earthly things found favour in his sight<br/>  Save concubines and carnal companie,<br/>And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.<br/><br/>Childe Harold was he hight:--but whence his name<br/>  And lineage long, it suits me not to say;<br/>  Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,<br/>  And had been glorious in another day:<br/>  But one sad losel soils a name for ay,<br/>  However mighty in the olden time;<br/>  Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,<br/>  Nor florid prose, nor honied lies of rhyme,<br/>Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.<br/><br/>Childe Harold basked him in the Noontide sun,<br/>  Disporting there like any other fly;<br/>  Nor deemed before his little day was done<br/>  One blast might chill him into misery.<br/>  But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,<br/>  Worse than Adversity the Childe befell;<br/>  He felt the fulness of Satiety:<br/>  Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,<br/>Which seemed to him more lone than Eremite's sad cell.<br/><br/>For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,<br/>  Nor made atonement when he did amiss,<br/>  Had sighed to many though he loved but one,<br/>  And that loved one, alas! could ne'er be his.<br/>  Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss<br/>  Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;<br/>  Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,<br/>  And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,<br/>Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.<br/><br/>And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,<br/>  And from his fellow Bacchanals would flee;<br/>  'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,<br/>  But Pride congealed the drop within his ee:<br/>  Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,<br/>  And from his native land resolved to go,<br/>  And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;<br/>  With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,<br/>And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.<br/><br/>The Childe departed from his father's hall:<br/>  It was a vast and venerable pile;<br/>  So old, it seem√©d only not to fall,<br/>  Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.<br/>  Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile!<br/>  Where Superstition once had made her den<br/>  Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;<br/>  And monks might deem their time was come agen,<br/>If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.<br/><br/>Yet oft-times in his maddest mirthful mood<br/>  Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,<br/>  As if the Memory of some deadly feud<br/>  Or disappointed passion lurked below:<br/>  But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;<br/>  For his was not that open, artless soul<br/>  That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow,<br/>  Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,<br/>Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.<br/><br/>And none did love him!--though to hall and bower<br/>  He gathered revellers from far and near,<br/>  He knew them flatterers of the festal hour,<br/>  The heartless Parasites of present cheer.<br/>  Yea! none did love him--not his lemans dear--<br/>  But pomp and power alone are Woman's care,<br/>  And where these are light Eros finds a feere;<br/>  Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,<br/>And Mammon wins his way where Seraphs might despair.<br/><br/>Childe Harold had a mother--not forgot,<br/>  Though parting from that mother he did shun;<br/>  A sister whom he loved, but saw her not<br/>  Before his weary pilgrimage begun:<br/>  If friends he had, he bade adieu to none.<br/>  Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel:<br/>  Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon<br/>  A few dear objects, will in sadness feel<br/>Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.<br/><br/>His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,<br/>  The laughing dames in whom he did delight,<br/>  Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,<br/>  Might shake the Saintship of an Anchorite,<br/>  And long had fed his youthful appetite;<br/>  His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,<br/>  And all that mote to luxury invite,<br/>  Without a sigh he left, to cross the brine,<br/>And traverse Paynim shores, and pass Earth's central line.<br/><br/>The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew,<br/>  As glad to waft him from his native home;<br/>  And fast the white rocks faded from his view,<br/>  And soon were lost in circumambient foam:<br/>  And then, it may be, of his wish to roam<br/>  Repented he, but in his bosom slept<br/>  The silent thought, nor from his lips did come<br/>  One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,<br/>And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.<br/><br/>But when the Sun was sinking in the sea<br/>  He seized his harp, which he at times could string,<br/>  And strike, albeit with untaught melody,<br/>  When deemed he no strange ear was listening:<br/>  And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,<br/>  And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight;<br/>  While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,<br/>  And fleeting shores receded from his sight,<br/>Thus to the elements he poured his last "Good Night."<br/><br/>CHILDE HAROLD'S GOOD NIGHT.<br/><br/>"Adieu, adieu! my native shore<br/>  Fades o'er the waters blue;<br/>The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,<br/>  And shrieks the wild sea-mew.<br/>Yon Sun that sets upon the sea<br/>  We follow in his flight;<br/>Farewell awhile to him and thee,<br/>  My native Land--Good Night!<br/><br/>"A few short hours and He will rise<br/>  To give the Morrow birth;<br/>And I shall hail the main and skies,<br/>  But not my mother Earth.<br/>Deserted is my own good Hall,<br/>  Its hearth is desolate;<br/>Wild weeds are gathering on the wall;<br/>  My Dog howls at the gate.<br/><br/>"Come hither, hither, my little page<br/>  Why dost thou weep and wail?<br/>Or dost thou dread the billows' rage,<br/>  Or tremble at the gale?<br/>But dash the tear-drop from thine eye;<br/>  Our ship is swift and strong:<br/>Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly<br/>  More merrily along."<br/><br/>"Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,<br/>  I fear not wave nor wind:<br/>Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I<br/>  Am sorrowful in mind;<br/>For I have from my father gone,<br/>  A mother whom I love,<br/>And have no friend, save these alone,<br/>  But thee--and One above.<br/><br/>'My father blessed me fervently,<br/>  Yet did not much complain;<br/>But sorely will my mother sigh<br/>  Till I come back again.'--<br/>"Enough, enough, my little lad!<br/>  Such tears become thine eye;<br/>If I thy guileless bosom had,<br/>  Mine own would not be dry.<br/><br/>"Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,<br/>  Why dost thou look so pale?<br/>Or dost thou dread a French foeman?<br/>  Or shiver at the gale?"--<br/>'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?<br/>  Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;<br/>But thinking on an absent wife<br/>  Will blanch a faithful cheek.<br/><br/>'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,<br/>  Along the bordering Lake,<br/>And when they on their father call,<br/>  What answer shall she make?'--<br/>"Enough, enough, my yeoman good,<br/>  Thy grief let none gainsay;<br/>But I, who am of lighter mood,<br/>  Will laugh to flee away.<br/><br/>"For who would trust the seeming sighs<br/>  Of wife or paramour?<br/>Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes<br/>  We late saw streaming o'er.<br/>For pleasures past I do not grieve,<br/>  Nor perils gathering near;<br/>My greatest grief is that I leave<br/>  No thing that claims a tear.<br/><br/>"And now I'm in the world alone,<br/>  Upon the wide, wide sea:<br/>But why should I for others groan,<br/>  When none will sigh for me?<br/>Perchance my Dog will whine in vain,<br/>  Till fed by stranger hands;<br/>But long ere I come back again,<br/>  He'd tear me where he stands.<br/><br/>"With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go<br/>  Athwart the foaming brine;<br/>Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,<br/>  So not again to mine.<br/>Welcome, welcome, ye dark-blue waves!<br/>  And when you fail my sight,<br/>Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!<br/>  My native Land--Good Night!"<br/><br/>On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,<br/>  And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.<br/>  Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,<br/>  New shores descried make every bosom gay;<br/>  And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,<br/>  And Tagus dashing onward to the Deep,<br/>  His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;<br/>  And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,<br/>And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.<br/><br/>Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see<br/>  What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!<br/>  What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!<br/>  What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!<br/>  But man would mar them with an impious hand:<br/>  And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge<br/>  'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,<br/>  With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge<br/>Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge<br/><br/>What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!<br/>  Her image floating on that noble tide,<br/>  Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,<br/>  But now whereon a thousand keels did ride<br/>  Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,<br/>  And to the Lusians did her aid afford:<br/>  A nation swoln with ignorance and pride,<br/>  Who lick yet loathe the hand that waves the sword<br/>To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.<br/><br/>But whoso entereth within this town,<br/>  That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,<br/>  Disconsolate will wander up and down,<br/>  'Mid many things unsightly to strange ee;<br/>  For hut and palace show like filthily:<br/>  The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;<br/>  Ne personage of high or mean degree<br/>  Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,<br/>Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.<br/><br/>Poor, paltry slaves! yet born 'midst noblest scenes--<br/>  Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?<br/>  Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes<br/>  In variegated maze of mount and glen.<br/>  Ah, me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,<br/>  To follow half on which the eye dilates<br/>  Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken<br/>  Than those whereof such things the Bard relates,<br/>Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates.<br/><br/>The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,<br/>  The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,<br/>  The mountain-moss by scorching skies imbrowned,<br/>  The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,<br/>  The tender azure of the unruffled deep,<br/>  The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,<br/>  The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,<br/>  The vine on high, the willow branch below,<br/>Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.<br/><br/>Then slowly climb the many-winding way,<br/>  And frequent turn to linger as you go,<br/>  From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,<br/>  And rest ye at "Our Lady's house of Woe;"<br/>  Where frugal monks their little relics show,<br/>  And sundry legends to the stranger tell:<br/>  Here impious men have punished been, and lo!<br/>  Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,<br/>In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.<br/><br/>And here and there, as up the crags you spring,<br/>  Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path:<br/>  Yet deem not these Devotion's offering--<br/>  These are memorials frail of murderous wrath:<br/>  For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath<br/>  Pour'd forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,<br/>  Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;<br/>  And grove and glen with thousand such are rife<br/>Throughout this purple land, where Law secures not life.<br/><br/>On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,<br/>  Are domes where whilome kings did make repair;<br/>  But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:<br/>  Yet ruined Splendour still is lingering there.<br/>  And yonder towers the Prince's palace fair:<br/>  There thou too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,<br/>  Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware<br/>  When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,<br/>Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.<br/><br/>Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan,<br/>  Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow:<br/>  But now, as if a thing unblest by Man,<br/>  Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as Thou!<br/>  Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow<br/>  To Halls deserted, portals gaping wide:<br/>  Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how<br/>  Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;<br/>Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide!<br/><br/>Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!<br/>  Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!<br/>  With diadem hight Foolscap, lo! a Fiend,<br/>  A little Fiend that scoffs incessantly,<br/>  There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by<br/>  His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,<br/>  Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,<br/>  And sundry signatures adorn the roll,<br/>Whereat the Urchin points and laughs with all his soul.<br/><br/>Convention is the dwarfish demon styled<br/>  That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:<br/>  Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,<br/>  And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.<br/>  Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,<br/>  And Policy regained what arms had lost:<br/>  For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!<br/>  Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,<br/>Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.<br/><br/>And ever since that martial Synod met,<br/>  Britannia sickens, Cintra! at thy name;<br/>  And folks in office at the mention fret,<br/>  And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.<br/>  How will Posterity the deed proclaim!<br/>  Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,<br/>  To view these champions cheated of their fame,<br/>  By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,<br/>Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?<br/><br/>So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he<br/>  Did take his way in solitary guise:<br/>  Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,<br/>  More restless than the swallow in the skies:<br/>  Though here awhile he learned to moralise,<br/>  For Meditation fixed at times on him;<br/>  And conscious Reason whispered to despise<br/>  His early youth, misspent in maddest whim;<br/>But as he gazed on truth his aching eyes grew dim.<br/><br/>To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits<br/>  A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:<br/>  Again he rouses from his moping fits,<br/>  But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.<br/>  Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal<br/>  Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;<br/>  And o'er him many changing scenes must roll<br/>  Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,<br/>Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.<br/><br/>Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,<br/>  Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;<br/>  And Church and Court did mingle their array,<br/>  And Mass and revel were alternate seen;<br/>  Lordlings and freres--ill-sorted fry I ween!<br/>  But here the Babylonian Whore hath built<br/>  A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,<br/>  That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,<br/>And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to varnish guilt.<br/><br/>O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,<br/>  (Oh, that such hills upheld a freeborn race!)<br/>  Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,<br/>  Childe Harold wends through many a pleasant place.<br/>  Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,<br/>  And marvel men should quit their easy chair,<br/>  The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace,<br/>  Oh! there is sweetness in the mountain air,<br/>And Life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.<br/><br/>More bleak to view the hills at length recede,<br/>  And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:<br/>  Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!<br/>  Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,<br/>  Spain's realms appear whereon her shepherds tend<br/>  Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows--<br/>  Now must the Pastor's arm his _lambs_ defend:<br/>  For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,<br/>And _all_ must shield their _all_, or share Subjection's woes.<br/><br/>Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,<br/>  Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?<br/>  Or ere the jealous Queens of Nations greet,<br/>  Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?<br/>  Or dark Sierras rise in craggy pride?<br/>  Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall?--<br/>  Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,<br/>  Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall,<br/>Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul:<br/><br/>But these between a silver streamlet glides,<br/>  And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,<br/>  Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides:<br/>  Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,<br/>  And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,<br/>  That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow;<br/>  For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:<br/>  Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know<br/>'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.<br/><br/>But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,<br/>  Dark Guadiana rolls his power along<br/>  In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,<br/>  So noted ancient roundelays among.<br/>  Whilome upon his banks did legions throng<br/>  Of Moor and Knight, in mail√©d splendour drest:<br/>  Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;<br/>  The Paynim turban and the Christian crest<br/>Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.<br/><br/>Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic Land!<br/>  Where is that standard which Pelagio bore,<br/>  When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band<br/>  That dyed thy mountain streams with Gothic gore?<br/>  Where are those bloody Banners which of yore<br/>  Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,<br/>  And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?<br/>  Red gleamed the Cross, and waned the Crescent pale,<br/>While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.<br/><br/>Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?<br/>  Ah!

who can curiously behold<br/>  The smoothness and the sheen of Beauty's cheek,<br/>  Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?<br/>  Who can contemplate Fame through clouds unfold<br/>  The star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?<br/>  Harold, once more within the vortex, rolled<br/>  On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,<br/>Yet with a nobler aim than in his Youth's fond prime.<br/><br/>But soon he knew himself the most unfit<br/>  Of men to herd with Man, with whom he held<br/>  Little in common; untaught to submit<br/>  His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled<br/>  In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,<br/>  He would not yield dominion of his mind<br/>  To Spirits against whom his own rebelled,<br/>  Proud though in desolation--which could find<br/>A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.<br/><br/>Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;<br/>  Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;<br/>  Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,<br/>  He had the passion and the power to roam;<br/>  The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,<br/>  Were unto him companionship; they spake<br/>  A mutual language, clearer than the tome<br/>  Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake<br/>For Nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.<br/><br/>Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,<br/>  Till he had peopled them with beings bright<br/>  As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,<br/>  And human frailties, were forgotten quite:<br/>  Could he have kept his spirit to that flight<br/>  He had been happy; but this clay will sink<br/>  Its spark immortal, envying it the light<br/>  To which it mounts, as if to break the link<br/>That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.<br/><br/>But in Man's dwellings he became a thing<br/>  Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,<br/>  Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,<br/>  To whom the boundless air alone were home:<br/>  Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,<br/>  As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat<br/>  His breast and beak against his wiry dome<br/>  Till the blood tinge his plumage--so the heat<br/>Of his impeded Soul would through his bosom eat.<br/><br/>Self-exiled Harold wanders forth again,<br/>  With nought of Hope left--but with less of gloom;<br/>  The very knowledge that he lived in vain,<br/>  That all was over on this side the tomb,<br/>  Had made Despair a smilingness assume,<br/>  Which, though 'twere wild,--as on the plundered wreck<br/>  When mariners would madly meet their doom<br/>  With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck,--<br/>Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.<br/><br/>Stop!--for thy tread is on an Empire's dust!<br/>  An Earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!<br/>  Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?<br/>  Nor column trophied for triumphal show?<br/>  None; but _the moral's truth_ tells simpler so.--<br/>  As the ground was before, thus let it be;--<br/>  How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!<br/>  And is this all the world has gained by thee,<br/>Thou first and last of Fields! king-making Victory?<br/><br/>And Harold stands upon this place of skulls,<br/>  The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!<br/>  How in an hour the Power which gave annuls<br/>  Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!--<br/>  In "pride of place" here last the Eagle flew,<br/>  Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,<br/>  Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through;<br/>  Ambition's life and labours all were vain--<br/>He wears the shattered links of the World's broken chain.<br/><br/>Fit retribution! Gaul may champ the bit<br/>  And foam in fetters;--but is Earth more free?<br/>  Did nations combat to make _One_ submit?<br/>  Or league to teach all Kings true Sovereignty?<br/>  What! shall reviving Thraldom again be<br/>  The patched-up Idol of enlightened days?<br/>  Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we<br/>  Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze<br/>And servile knees to Thrones? No! _prove_ before ye praise!<br/><br/>If not, o'er one fallen Despot boast no more!<br/>  In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears<br/>  For Europe's flowers long rooted up before<br/>  The trampler of her vineyards; in vain, years<br/>  Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,<br/>  Have all been borne, and broken by the accord<br/>  Of roused-up millions: all that most endears<br/>  Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a Sword,<br/>Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant Lord.<br/><br/>There was a sound of revelry by night,<br/>  And Belgium's Capital had gathered then<br/>  Her Beauty and her Chivalry--and bright<br/>  The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;<br/>  A thousand hearts beat happily; and when<br/>  Music arose with its voluptuous swell,<br/>  Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,<br/>  And all went merry as a marriage bell;<br/>But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!<br/><br/>Did ye not hear it?--No--'twas but the Wind,<br/>  Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;<br/>  On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;<br/>  No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet<br/>  To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--<br/>  But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,<br/>  As if the clouds its echo would repeat;<br/>  And nearer--clearer--deadlier than before!<br/>Arm! Arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!<br/><br/>Within a windowed niche of that high hall<br/>  Sate Brunswick's fated Chieftain; he did hear<br/>  That sound the first amidst the festival,<br/>  And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;<br/>  And when they smiled because he deemed it near,<br/>  His heart more truly knew that peal too well<br/>  Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,<br/>  And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell;<br/>He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.<br/><br/>Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro--<br/>  And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,<br/>  And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago<br/>  Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness--<br/>  And there were sudden partings, such as press<br/>  The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs<br/>  Which ne'er might be repeated; who could guess<br/>  If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,<br/>Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!<br/><br/>And there was mounting in hot haste--the steed,<br/>  The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,<br/>  Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,<br/>  And swiftly forming in the ranks of war--<br/>  And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;<br/>  And near, the beat of the alarming drum<br/>  Roused up the soldier ere the Morning Star;<br/>  While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,<br/>Or whispering, with white lips--"The foe! They come! they come!"<br/><br/>And wild and high the "Cameron's Gathering" rose!<br/>  The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills<br/>  Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes;--<br/>  How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,<br/>  Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills<br/>  Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers<br/>  With the fierce native daring which instils<br/>  The stirring memory of a thousand years,<br/>And Evan's--Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears!<br/><br/>And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,<br/>  Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass--<br/>  Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,<br/>  Over the unreturning brave,--alas!<br/>  Ere evening to be trodden like the grass<br/>  Which now beneath them, but above shall grow<br/>  In its next verdure, when this fiery mass<br/>  Of living Valour, rolling on the foe<br/>And burning with high Hope, shall moulder cold and low.<br/><br/>Last noon beheld them full of lusty life;--<br/>  Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay;<br/>  The Midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,<br/>  The Morn the marshalling in arms,--the Day<br/>  Battle's magnificently-stern array!<br/>  The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent<br/>  The earth is covered thick with other clay<br/>  Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,<br/>Rider and horse,--friend,--foe,--in one red burial blent!<br/><br/>Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;<br/>  Yet one I would select from that proud throng,<br/>  Partly because they blend me with his line,<br/>  And partly that I did his Sire some wrong,<br/>  And partly that bright names will hallow song;<br/>  And his was of the bravest, and when showered<br/>  The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,<br/>  Even where the thickest of War's tempest lowered,<br/>They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!<br/><br/>There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,<br/>  And mine were nothing, had I such to give;<br/>  But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,<br/>  Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,<br/>  And saw around me the wide field revive<br/>  With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring<br/>  Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,<br/>  With all her reckless birds upon the wing,<br/>I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.<br/><br/>I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each<br/>  And one as all a ghastly gap did make<br/>  In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach<br/>  Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;<br/>  The Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake<br/>  Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame<br/>  May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake<br/>  The fever of vain longing, and the name<br/>So honoured but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.<br/><br/>They mourn, but smile at length--and, smiling, mourn:<br/>  The tree will wither long before it fall;<br/>  The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;<br/>  The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall<br/>  In massy hoariness; the ruined wall<br/>  Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;<br/>  The bars survive the captive they enthral;<br/>  The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;<br/>And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:<br/><br/>Even as a broken Mirror, which the glass<br/>  In every fragment multiplies--and makes<br/>  A thousand images of one that was,<br/>  The same--and still the more, the more it breaks;<br/>  And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,<br/>  Living in shattered guise; and still, and cold,<br/>  And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,<br/>  Yet withers on till all without is old,<br/>Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.<br/><br/>There is a very life in our despair,<br/>  Vitality of poison,--a quick root<br/>  Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were<br/>  As nothing did we die; but Life will suit<br/>  Itself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,<br/>  Like to the apples on the Dead Sea's shore,<br/>  All ashes to the taste: Did man compute<br/>  Existence by enjoyment, and count o'er<br/>Such hours 'gainst years of life,--say, would he name threescore?<br/><br/>The Psalmist numbered out the years of man:<br/>  They are enough; and if thy tale be _true_,<br/>  Thou, who didst grudge him even that fleeting span,<br/>  More than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!<br/>  Millions of tongues record thee, and anew<br/>  Their children's lips shall echo them, and say--<br/>  "Here, where the sword united nations drew,<br/>  Our countrymen were warring on that day!"<br/>And this is much--and all--which will not pass away.<br/><br/>There sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,<br/>  Whose Spirit, antithetically mixed,<br/>  One moment of the mightiest, and again<br/>  On little objects with like firmness fixed;<br/>  Extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,<br/>  Thy throne had still been thine, or never been;<br/>  For Daring made thy rise as fall: thou seek'st<br/>  Even now to re-assume the imperial mien,<br/>And shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!<br/><br/>Conqueror and Captive of the Earth art thou!<br/>  She trembles at thee still, and thy wild name<br/>  Was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now<br/>  That thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,<br/>  Who wooed thee once, thy Vassal, and became<br/>  The flatterer of thy fierceness--till thou wert<br/>  A God unto thyself; nor less the same<br/>  To the astounded kingdoms all inert,<br/>Who deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.<br/><br/>Oh, more or less than man--in high or low--<br/>  Battling with nations, flying from the field;<br/>  Now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now<br/>  More than thy meanest soldier taught to yield;<br/>  An Empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,<br/>  But govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,<br/>  However deeply in men's spirits skilled,<br/>  Look through thine own, nor curb the lust of War,<br/>Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest Star.<br/><br/>Yet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide<br/>  With that untaught innate philosophy,<br/>  Which, be it Wisdom, Coldness, or deep Pride,<br/>  Is gall and wormwood to an enemy.<br/>  When the whole host of hatred stood hard by,<br/>  To watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled<br/>  With a sedate and all-enduring eye;--<br/>  When Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,<br/>He stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.<br/><br/>Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them<br/>  Ambition steeled thee on too far to show<br/>  That just habitual scorn, which could contemn<br/>  Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so<br/>  To wear it ever on thy lip and brow,<br/>  And spurn the instruments thou wert to use<br/>  Till they were turned unto thine overthrow:<br/>  'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;<br/>So hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.<br/><br/>If, like a tower upon a headlong rock,<br/>  Thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,<br/>  Such scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;<br/>  But men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,<br/>  _Their_ admiration thy best weapon shone;<br/>  The part of Philip's son was thine, not then<br/>  (Unless aside thy Purple had been thrown)<br/>  Like stern Diogenes to mock at men--<br/>For sceptred Cynics Earth were far too wide a den.<br/><br/>But Quiet to quick bosoms is a Hell,<br/>  And _there_ hath been thy bane; there is a fire<br/>  And motion of the Soul which will not dwell<br/>  In its own narrow being, but aspire<br/>  Beyond the fitting medium of desire;<br/>  And, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,<br/>  Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire<br/>  Of aught but rest; a fever at the core,<br/>Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.<br/><br/>This makes the madmen who have made men mad<br/>  By their contagion; Conquerors and Kings,<br/>  Founders of sects and systems, to whom add<br/>  Sophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things<br/>  Which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,<br/>  And are themselves the fools to those they fool;<br/>  Envied, yet how unenviable! what stings<br/>  Are theirs! One breast laid open were a school<br/>Which would unteach Mankind the lust to shine or rule:<br/><br/>Their breath is agitation, and their life<br/>  A storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,<br/>  And yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,<br/>  That should their days, surviving perils past,<br/>  Melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast<br/>  With sorrow and supineness, and so die;<br/>  Even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste<br/>  With its own flickering, or a sword laid by,<br/>Which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.<br/><br/>He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find<br/>  The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;<br/>  He who surpasses or subdues mankind,<br/>  Must look down on the hate of those below.<br/>  Though high _above_ the Sun of Glory glow,<br/>  And far _beneath_ the Earth and Ocean spread,<br/>  _Round_ him are icy rocks, and loudly blow<br/>  Contending tempests on his naked head,<br/>And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.<br/><br/>Away with these! true Wisdom's world will be<br/>  Within its own creation, or in thine,<br/>  Maternal Nature! for who teems like thee,<br/>  Thus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?<br/>  There Harold gazes on a work divine,<br/>  A blending of all beauties; streams and dells,<br/>  Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine,<br/>  And chiefless castles breathing stern farewells<br/>From gray but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.<br/><br/>And there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,<br/>  Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,<br/>  All tenantless, save to the crannying Wind,<br/>  Or holding dark communion with the Cloud<br/>  There was a day when they were young and proud;<br/>  Banners on high, and battles passed below;<br/>  But they who fought are in a bloody shroud,<br/>  And those which waved are shredless dust ere now,<br/>And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.<br/><br/>Beneath these battlements, within those walls,<br/>  Power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state<br/>  Each robber chief upheld his arm√©d halls,<br/>  Doing his evil will, nor less elate<br/>  Than mightier heroes of a longer date.<br/>  What want these outlaws conquerors should have<br/>  But History's purchased page to call them great?<br/>  A wider space--an ornamented grave?<br/>Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.<br/><br/>In their baronial feuds and single fields,<br/>  What deeds of prowess unrecorded died!<br/>  And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,<br/>  With emblems well devised by amorous pride,<br/>  Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;<br/>  But still their flame was fierceness, and drew on<br/>  Keen contest and destruction near allied,<br/>  And many a tower for some fair mischief won,<br/>Saw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.<br/><br/>But Thou, exulting and abounding river!<br/>  Making thy waves a blessing as they flow<br/>  Through banks whose beauty would endure for ever<br/>  Could man but leave thy bright creation so,<br/>  Nor its fair promise from the surface mow<br/>  With the sharp scythe of conflict, then to see<br/>  Thy valley of sweet waters, were to know<br/>  Earth paved like Heaven--and to seem such to me,<br/>Even now what wants thy stream?--that it should Lethe be.<br/><br/>A thousand battles have assailed thy banks,<br/>  But these and half their fame have passed away,<br/>  And Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:<br/>  Their very graves are gone, and what are they?<br/>  Thy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,<br/>  And all was stainless, and on thy clear stream<br/>  Glassed, with its dancing light, the sunny ray;<br/>  But o'er the blacken'd memory's blighting dream<br/>Thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.<br/><br/>Thus Harold inly said, and passed along,<br/>  Yet not insensible to all which here<br/>  Awoke the jocund birds to early song<br/>  In glens which might have made even exile dear:<br/>  Though on his brow were graven lines austere,<br/>  And tranquil sternness, which had ta'en the place<br/>  Of feelings fierier far but less severe--<br/>  Joy was not always absent from his face,<br/>But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.<br/><br/>Nor was all Love shut from him, though his days<br/>  Of Passion had consumed themselves to dust.<br/>  It is in vain that we would coldly gaze<br/>  On such as smile upon us; the heart must<br/>  Leap kindly back to kindness, though Disgust<br/>  Hath weaned it from all worldlings: thus he felt,<br/>  For there was soft Remembrance, and sweet Trust<br/>  In one fond breast, to which his own would melt,<br/>And in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.<br/><br/>And he had learned to love,--I know not why,<br/>  For this in such as him seems strange of mood,<br/>  The helpless looks of blooming Infancy,<br/>  Even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,<br/>  To change like this, a mind so far imbued<br/>  With scorn of man, it little boots to know;<br/>  But thus it was; and though in solitude<br/>  Small power the nipped affections have to grow,<br/>In him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.<br/><br/>And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,<br/>  Which unto his was bound by stronger ties<br/>  Than the church links withal; and--though unwed,<br/>  _That_ love was pure--and, far above disguise,<br/>  Had stood the test of mortal enmities<br/>  Still undivided, and cemented more<br/>  By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;<br/>  But this was firm, and from a foreign shore<br/>Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!<br/><br/>The castled Crag of Drachenfels<br/>Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine,<br/>Whose breast of waters broadly swells<br/>Between the banks which bear the vine,<br/>And hills all rich with blossomed trees,<br/>And fields which promise corn and wine,<br/>And scattered cities crowning these,<br/>Whose far white walls along them shine,<br/>Have strewed a scene, which I should see<br/>With double joy wert _thou_ with me.<br/><br/>And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,<br/>And hands which offer early flowers,<br/>Walk smiling o'er this Paradise;<br/>Above, the frequent feudal towers<br/>Through green leaves lift their walls of gray;<br/>And many a rock which steeply lowers,<br/>And noble arch in proud decay,<br/>Look o'er this vale of vintage-bowers;<br/>But one thing want these banks of Rhine,--<br/>Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!<br/><br/>I send the lilies given to me--<br/>Though long before thy hand they touch,<br/>I know that they must withered be,<br/>But yet reject them not as such;<br/>For I have cherished them as dear,<br/>Because they yet may meet thine eye,<br/>And guide thy soul to mine even here,<br/>When thou behold'st them drooping nigh,<br/>And know'st them gathered by the Rhine,<br/>And offered from my heart to thine!<br/><br/>The river nobly foams and flows--<br/>The charm of this enchanted ground,<br/>And all its thousand turns disclose<br/>Some fresher beauty varying round:<br/>The haughtiest breast its wish might bound<br/>Through life to dwell delighted here;<br/>Nor could on earth a spot be found<br/>To Nature and to me so dear--<br/>Could thy dear eyes in following mine<br/>Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!<br/><br/>By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,<br/>  There is a small and simple Pyramid,<br/>  Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;<br/>  Beneath its base are Heroes' ashes hid--<br/>  Our enemy's--but let not that forbid<br/>  Honour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb<br/>  Tears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,<br/>  Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,<br/>Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.<br/><br/>Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career,--<br/>  His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;<br/>  And fitly may the stranger lingering here<br/>  Pray for his gallant Spirit's bright repose;--<br/>  For he was Freedom's Champion, one of those,<br/>  The few in number, who had not o'erstept<br/>  The charter to chastise which she bestows<br/>  On such as wield her weapons; he had kept<br/>The whiteness of his soul--and thus men o'er him wept.<br/><br/>Here Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall<br/>  Black with the miner's blast, upon her height<br/>  Yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball<br/>  Rebounding idly on her strength did light:--<br/>  A Tower of Victory! from whence the flight<br/>  Of baffled foes was watched along the plain:<br/>  But Peace destroyed what War could never blight,<br/>  And laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain--<br/>On which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.<br/><br/>Adieu to thee, fair Rhine! How long delighted<br/>  The stranger fain would linger on his way!<br/>  Thine is a scene alike where souls united<br/>  Or lonely Contemplation thus might stray;<br/>  And could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey<br/>  On self-condemning bosoms, it were here,<br/>  Where Nature, nor too sombre nor too gay,<br/>  Wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,<br/>Is to the mellow Earth as Autumn to the year.<br/><br/>Adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!<br/>  There can be no farewell to scene like thine;<br/>  The mind is coloured by thy every hue;<br/>  And if reluctantly the eyes resign<br/>  Their cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!<br/>  'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;<br/>  More mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,<br/>  But none unite in one attaching maze<br/>The brilliant, fair, and soft,--the glories of old days,<br/><br/>The negligently grand, the fruitful bloom<br/>  Of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,<br/>  The rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,<br/>  The forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,--<br/>  The wild rocks shaped, as they had turrets been,<br/>  In mockery of man's art; and these withal<br/>  A race of faces happy as the scene,<br/>  Whose fertile bounties here extend to all,<br/>Still springing o'er thy banks, though Empires near them fall.<br/><br/>But these recede. Above me are the Alps,<br/>  The Palaces of Nature, whose vast walls<br/>  Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,<br/>  And throned Eternity in icy halls<br/>  Of cold Sublimity, where forms and falls<br/>  The Avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!<br/>  All that expands the spirit, yet appals,<br/>  Gather around these summits, as to show<br/>How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.<br/><br/>But ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,<br/>  There is a spot should not be passed in vain,--<br/>  Morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man<br/>  May gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,<br/>  Nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;<br/>  Here Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,<br/>  A bony heap, through ages to remain,<br/>  Themselves their monument;--the Stygian coast<br/>Unsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each<br/>                                       wandering ghost.<br/><br/>While Waterloo with Cann√¶'s carnage vies,<br/>  Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;<br/>  They were true Glory's stainless victories,<br/>  Won by the unambitious heart and hand<br/>  Of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,<br/>  All unbought champions in no princely cause<br/>  Of vice-entailed Corruption;

and there it stands<br/>  Making a marvel that it not decays,<br/>  When the coeval pride of human hands,<br/>Levelled Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.<br/><br/>And there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name!--<br/>  Julia--the daughter--the devoted--gave<br/>  Her youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim<br/>  Nearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.<br/>  Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave<br/>  The life she lived in--but the Judge was just--<br/>  And then she died on him she could not save.<br/>  Their tomb was simple, and without a bust,<br/>And held within their urn one mind--one heart--one dust.<br/><br/>But these are deeds which should not pass away,<br/>  And names that must not wither, though the Earth<br/>  Forgets her empires with a just decay,<br/>  The enslavers and the enslaved--their death and birth;<br/>  The high, the mountain-majesty of Worth<br/>  Should be--and shall, survivor of its woe,<br/>  And from its immortality, look forth<br/>  In the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,<br/>Imperishably pure beyond all things below.<br/><br/>Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,<br/>  The mirror where the stars and mountains view<br/>  The stillness of their aspect in each trace<br/>  Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:<br/>  There is too much of Man here, to look through<br/>  With a fit mind the might which I behold;<br/>  But soon in me shall Loneliness renew<br/>  Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,<br/>Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.<br/><br/>To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind:<br/>  All are not fit with them to stir and toil,<br/>  Nor is it discontent to keep the mind<br/>  Deep in its fountain, lest it overboil<br/>  In the hot throng, where we become the spoil<br/>  Of our infection, till too late and long<br/>  We may deplore and struggle with the coil,<br/>  In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong<br/>Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.<br/><br/>There, in a moment, we may plunge our years<br/>  In fatal penitence, and in the blight<br/>  Of our own Soul turn all our blood to tears,<br/>  And colour things to come with hues of Night;<br/>  The race of life becomes a hopeless flight<br/>  To those that walk in darkness: on the sea<br/>  The boldest steer but where their ports invite--<br/>  But there are wanderers o'er Eternity<br/>Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.<br/><br/>Is it not better, then, to be alone,<br/>  And love Earth only for its earthly sake?<br/>  By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,<br/>  Or the pure bosom of its nursing Lake,<br/>  Which feeds it as a mother who doth make<br/>  A fair but froward infant her own care,<br/>  Kissing its cries away as these awake;--<br/>  Is it not better thus our lives to wear,<br/>Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?<br/><br/>I live not in myself, but I become<br/>  Portion of that around me; and to me<br/>  High mountains are a feeling, but the hum<br/>  Of human cities torture: I can see<br/>  Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be<br/>  A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,<br/>  Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,<br/>  And with the sky--the peak--the heaving plain<br/>Of Ocean, or the stars, mingle--and not in vain.<br/><br/>And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:--<br/>  I look upon the peopled desert past,<br/>  As on a place of agony and strife,<br/>  Where, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,<br/>  To act and suffer, but remount at last<br/>  With a fresh pinion; which I feel to spring,<br/>  Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the Blast<br/>  Which it would cope with, on delighted wing,<br/>Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.<br/><br/>And when, at length, the mind shall be all free<br/>  From what it hates in this degraded form,<br/>  Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be<br/>  Existent happier in the fly and worm,--<br/>  When Elements to Elements conform,<br/>  And dust is as it should be, shall I not<br/>  Feel all I see less dazzling but more warm?<br/>  The bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?<br/>Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?<br/><br/>Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part<br/>  Of me and of my Soul, as I of them?<br/>  Is not the love of these deep in my heart<br/>  With a pure passion? should I not contemn<br/>  All objects, if compared with these? and stem<br/>  A tide of suffering, rather than forego<br/>  Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm<br/>  Of those whose eyes are only turned below,<br/>Gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?<br/><br/>But this is not my theme; and I return<br/>  To that which is immediate, and require<br/>  Those who find contemplation in the urn,<br/>  To look on One, whose dust was once all fire,--<br/>  A native of the land where I respire<br/>  The clear air for a while--a passing guest,<br/>  Where he became a being,--whose desire<br/>  Was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,<br/>The which to gain and keep, he sacrificed all rest.<br/><br/>Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,<br/>  The apostle of Affliction, he who threw<br/>  Enchantment over Passion, and from Woe<br/>  Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew<br/>  The breath which made him wretched; yet he knew<br/>  How to make Madness beautiful, and cast<br/>  O'er erring deeds and thoughts, a heavenly hue<br/>  Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past<br/>The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.<br/><br/>His love was Passion's essence--as a tree<br/>  On fire by lightning; with ethereal flame<br/>  Kindled he was, and blasted; for to be<br/>  Thus, and enamoured, were in him the same.<br/>  But his was not the love of living dame,<br/>  Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,<br/>  But of ideal Beauty, which became<br/>  In him existence, and o'erflowing teems<br/>Along his burning page, distempered though it seems.<br/><br/>_This_ breathed itself to life in Julie, _this_<br/>  Invested her with all that's wild and sweet;<br/>  This hallowed, too, the memorable kiss<br/>  Which every morn his fevered lip would greet,<br/>  From hers, who but with friendship his would meet;<br/>  But to that gentle touch, through brain and breast<br/>  Flashed the thrilled Spirit's love-devouring heat;<br/>  In that absorbing sigh perchance more blest<br/>Than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.<br/><br/>His life was one long war with self-sought foes,<br/>  Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind<br/>  Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose,<br/>  For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,<br/>  'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.<br/>  But he was phrensied, wherefore, who may know?<br/>  Since cause might be which Skill could never find;<br/>  But he was phrensied by disease or woe,<br/>To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.<br/><br/>For then he was inspired, and from him came,<br/>  As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,<br/>  Those oracles which set the world in flame,<br/>  Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:<br/>  Did he not this for France? which lay before<br/>  Bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?<br/>  Broken and trembling to the yoke she bore,<br/>  Till by the voice of him and his compeers,<br/>Roused up to too much wrath which follows o'ergrown fears?<br/><br/>They made themselves a fearful monument!<br/>  The wreck of old opinions--things which grew,<br/>  Breathed from the birth of Time: the veil they rent,<br/>  And what behind it lay, all earth shall view.<br/>  But good with ill they also overthrew,<br/>  Leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild<br/>  Upon the same foundation, and renew<br/>  Dungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,<br/>As heretofore, because Ambition was self-willed.<br/><br/>But this will not endure, nor be endured!<br/>  Mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.<br/>  They might have used it better, but, allured<br/>  By their new vigour, sternly have they dealt<br/>  On one another; Pity ceased to melt<br/>  With her once natural charities. But they,<br/>  Who in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,<br/>  They were not eagles, nourished with the day;<br/>What marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?<br/><br/>What deep wounds ever closed without a scar?<br/>  The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear<br/>  That which disfigures it; and they who war<br/>  With their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear<br/>  Silence, but not submission: in his lair<br/>  Fixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour<br/>  Which shall atone for years; none need despair:<br/>  It came--it cometh--and will come,--the power<br/>To punish or forgive--in _one_ we shall be slower.<br/><br/>Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,<br/>  With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing<br/>  Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake<br/>  Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.<br/>  This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing<br/>  To waft me from distraction; once I loved<br/>  Torn Ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring<br/>  Sounds sweet as if a Sister's voice reproved,<br/>That I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.<br/><br/>It is the hush of night, and all between<br/>  Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,<br/>  Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen,<br/>  Save darkened Jura, whose capt heights appear<br/>  Precipitously steep; and drawing near,<br/>  There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,<br/>  Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear<br/>  Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,<br/>Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more.<br/><br/>He is an evening reveller, who makes<br/>  His life an infancy, and sings his fill;<br/>  At intervals, some bird from out the brakes<br/>  Starts into voice a moment, then is still.<br/>  There seems a floating whisper on the hill,<br/>  But that is fancy--for the Starlight dews<br/>  All silently their tears of Love instil,<br/>  Weeping themselves away, till they infuse<br/>Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.<br/><br/>Ye Stars! which are the poetry of Heaven!<br/>  If in your bright leaves we would read the fate<br/>  Of men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,<br/>  That in our aspirations to be great,<br/>  Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,<br/>  And claim a kindred with you; for ye are<br/>  A Beauty and a Mystery, and create<br/>  In us such love and reverence from afar,<br/>That Fortune,--Fame,--Power,--Life, have named themselves a Star.<br/><br/>All Heaven and Earth are still--though not in sleep,<br/>  But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;<br/>  And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:--<br/>  All Heaven and Earth are still: From the high host<br/>  Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,<br/>  All is concentered in a life intense,<br/>  Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,<br/>  But hath a part of Being, and a sense<br/>Of that which is of all Creator and Defence.<br/><br/>Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt<br/>  In solitude, where we are _least_ alone;<br/>  A truth, which through our being then doth melt,<br/>  And purifies from self: it is a tone,<br/>  The soul and source of Music, which makes known<br/>  Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm<br/>  Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,<br/>  Binding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm<br/>The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.<br/><br/>Not vainly did the early Persian make<br/>  His altar the high places, and the peak<br/>  Of earth-o'ergazing mountains, --and thus take<br/>  A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek<br/>  The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak<br/>  Upreared of human hands. Come, and compare<br/>  Columns and idol-dwellings--Goth or Greek--<br/>  With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air--<br/>Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!<br/><br/>The sky is changed!--and such a change! Oh Night,<br/>  And Storm, and Darkness, ye are wondrous strong,<br/>  Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light<br/>  Of a dark eye in Woman! Far along,<br/>  From peak to peak, the rattling crags among<br/>  Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,<br/>  But every mountain now hath found a tongue,<br/>  And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,<br/>Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!<br/><br/>And this is in the Night:--Most glorious Night!<br/>  Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be<br/>  A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--<br/>  A portion of the tempest and of thee!<br/>  How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,<br/>  And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!<br/>  And now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee<br/>  Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,<br/>As if they did rejoice o'er a young Earthquake's birth.<br/><br/>Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between<br/>  Heights which appear as lovers who have parted<br/>  In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,<br/>  That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted:<br/>  Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,<br/>  Love was the very root of the fond rage<br/>  Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:--<br/>  Itself expired, but leaving them an age<br/>Of years all winters,--war within themselves to wage:<br/><br/>Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,<br/>  The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand:<br/>  For here, not one, but many, make their play,<br/>  And fling their thunder-bolts from hand to hand,<br/>  Flashing and cast around: of all the band,<br/>  The brightest through these parted hills hath forked<br/>  His lightnings,--as if he did understand,<br/>  That in such gaps as Desolation worked,<br/>There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.<br/><br/>Sky--Mountains--River--Winds--Lake--Lightnings! ye!<br/>  With night, and clouds, and thunder--and a Soul<br/>  To make these felt and feeling, well may be<br/>  Things that have made me watchful; the far roll<br/>  Of your departing voices, is the knoll<br/>  Of what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.<br/>  But where of ye, O Tempests! is the goal?<br/>  Are ye like those within the human breast?<br/>Or do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?<br/><br/>Could I embody and unbosom now<br/>  That which is most within me,--could I wreak<br/>  My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw<br/>  Soul--heart--mind--passions--feelings--strong or weak--<br/>  All that I would have sought, and all I seek,<br/>  Bear, know, feel--and yet breathe--into _one_ word,<br/>  And that one word were Lightning, I would speak;<br/>  But as it is, I live and die unheard,<br/>With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.<br/><br/>The Morn is up again, the dewy Morn,<br/>  With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom--<br/>  Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,<br/>  And living as if earth contained no tomb,--<br/>  And glowing into day: we may resume<br/>  The march of our existence: and thus I,<br/>  Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room<br/>  And food for meditation, nor pass by<br/>Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.<br/><br/>Clarens! sweet Clarens birthplace of deep Love!<br/>  Thine air is the young breath of passionate Thought;<br/>  Thy trees take root in Love; the snows above,<br/>  The very Glaciers have his colours caught,<br/>  And Sun-set into rose-hues sees them wrought<br/>  By rays which sleep there lovingly: the rocks,<br/>  The permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought<br/>  In them a refuge from the worldly shocks,<br/>Which stir and sting the Soul with Hope that woos, then mocks.<br/><br/>Clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,--<br/>  Undying Love's, who here ascends a throne<br/>  To which the steps are mountains; where the God<br/>  Is a pervading Life and Light,--so shown<br/>  Not on those summits solely, nor alone<br/>  In the still cave and forest; o'er the flower<br/>  His eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,<br/>  His soft and summer breath, whose tender power<br/>Passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.<br/><br/>All things are here of _Him_; from the black pines,<br/>  Which are his shade on high, and the loud roar<br/>  Of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines<br/>  Which slope his green path downward to the shore,<br/>  Where the bowed Waters meet him, and adore,<br/>  Kissing his feet with murmurs; and the Wood,<br/>  The covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,<br/>  But light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,<br/>Offering to him, and his, a populous solitude.<br/><br/>A populous solitude of bees and birds,<br/>  And fairy-formed and many-coloured things,<br/>  Who worship him with notes more sweet than words,<br/>  And innocently open their glad wings,<br/>  Fearless and full of life: the gush of springs,<br/>  And fall of lofty fountains, and the bend<br/>  Of stirring branches, and the bud which brings<br/>  The swiftest thought of Beauty, here extend<br/>Mingling--and made by Love--unto one mighty end.<br/><br/>He who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,<br/>  And make his heart a spirit; he who knows<br/>  That tender mystery, will love the more;<br/>  For this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,<br/>  And the world's waste, have driven him far from those,<br/>  For 'tis his nature to advance or die;<br/>  He stands not still, but or decays, or grows<br/>  Into a boundless blessing, which may vie<br/>With the immortal lights, in its eternity!<br/><br/>'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,<br/>  Peopling it with affections; but he found<br/>  It was the scene which Passion must allot<br/>  To the Mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground<br/>  Where early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,<br/>  And hallowed it with loveliness: 'tis lone,<br/>  And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,<br/>  And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone<br/>Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.<br/><br/>Lausanne!

I twine<br/>  My hopes of being remembered in my line<br/>  With my land's language: if too fond and far<br/>  These aspirations in their scope incline,--<br/>  If my Fame should be, as my fortunes are,<br/>Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar<br/><br/>My name from out the temple where the dead<br/>  Are honoured by the Nations--let it be--<br/>  And light the Laurels on a loftier head!<br/>  And be the Spartan's epitaph on me--<br/>  "Sparta hath many a worthier son than he."<br/>  Meantime I seek no sympathies, nor need--<br/>  The thorns which I have reaped are of the tree<br/>  I planted,--they have torn me,--and I bleed:<br/>I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.<br/><br/>The spouseless Adriatic mourns her Lord,<br/>  And annual marriage now no more renewed--<br/>  The Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,<br/>  Neglected garment of her widowhood!<br/>  St. Mark yet sees his Lion where he stood<br/>  Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,<br/>  Over the proud Place where an Emperor sued,<br/>  And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour<br/>When Venice was a Queen with an unequalled dower.<br/><br/>The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns--<br/>  An Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;<br/>  Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains<br/>  Clank over sceptred cities; Nations melt<br/>  From Power's high pinnacle, when they have felt<br/>  The sunshine for a while, and downward go<br/>  Like Lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt;<br/>  Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!<br/>Th' octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.<br/><br/>Before St. Mark still glow his Steeds of brass,<br/>  Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;<br/>  But is not Doria's menace come to pass?<br/>  Are they not bridled?--Venice, lost and won,<br/>  Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,<br/>  Sinks, like a sea-weed, unto whence she rose!<br/>  Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,<br/>  Even in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,<br/>From whom Submission wrings an infamous repose.<br/><br/>In youth She was all glory,--a new Tyre,--<br/>  Her very by-word sprung from Victory,<br/>  The "Planter of the Lion," which through fire<br/>  And blood she bore o'er subject Earth and Sea;<br/>  Though making many slaves, Herself still free,<br/>  And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite;<br/>  Witness Troy's rival, Candia! Vouch it, ye<br/>  Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!<br/>For ye are names no Time nor Tyranny can blight.<br/><br/>Statues of glass--all shivered--the long file<br/>  Of her dead Doges are declined to dust;<br/>  But where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile<br/>  Bespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;<br/>  Their sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,<br/>  Have yielded to the stranger: empty halls,<br/>  Thin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must<br/>  Too oft remind her who and what enthrals,<br/>Have flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.<br/><br/>When Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,<br/>  And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,<br/>  Redemption rose up in the Attic Muse,<br/>  Her voice their only ransom from afar:<br/>  See! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car<br/>  Of the o'ermastered Victor stops--the reins<br/>  Fall from his hands--his idle scimitar<br/>  Starts from its belt--he rends his captive's chains,<br/>And bids him thank the Bard for Freedom and his strains.<br/><br/>Thus, Venice! if no stronger claim were thine,<br/>  Were all thy proud historic deeds forgot--<br/>  Thy choral memory of the Bard divine,<br/>  Thy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot<br/>  Which ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot<br/>  Is shameful to the nations,--most of all,<br/>  Albion! to thee: the Ocean queen should not<br/>  Abandon Ocean's children; in the fall<br/>Of Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.<br/><br/>I loved her from my boyhood--she to me<br/>  Was as a fairy city of the heart,<br/>  Rising like water-columns from the sea--<br/>  Of Joy the sojourn, and of Wealth the mart;<br/>  And Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakespeare's art,<br/>  Had stamped her image in me, and even so,<br/>  Although I found her thus, we did not part;<br/>  Perchance even dearer in her day of woe,<br/>Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.<br/><br/>I can repeople with the past--and of<br/>  The present there is still for eye and thought,<br/>  And meditation chastened down, enough;<br/>  And more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;<br/>  And of the happiest moments which were wrought<br/>  Within the web of my existence, some<br/>  From thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:<br/>  There are some feelings Time can not benumb,<br/>Nor Torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.<br/><br/>But from their nature will the Tannen grow<br/>  Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,<br/>  Rooted in barrenness, where nought below<br/>  Of soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks<br/>  Of eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks<br/>  The howling tempest, till its height and frame<br/>  Are worthy of the mountains from whose blocks<br/>  Of bleak, gray granite into life it came,<br/>And grew a giant tree;--the Mind may grow the same.<br/><br/>Existence may be borne, and the deep root<br/>  Of life and sufferance make its firm abode<br/>  In bare and desolated bosoms: mute<br/>  The camel labours with the heaviest load,<br/>  And the wolf dies in silence--not bestowed<br/>  In vain should such example be; if they,<br/>  Things of ignoble or of savage mood,<br/>  Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay<br/>May temper it to bear,--it is but for a day.<br/><br/>All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,<br/>  Even by the sufferer--and, in each event,<br/>  Ends:--Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,<br/>  Return to whence they came--with like intent,<br/>  And weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,<br/>  Wax gray and ghastly, withering ere their time,<br/>  And perish with the reed on which they leant;<br/>  Some seek devotion--toil--war--good or crime,<br/>According as their souls were formed to sink or climb.<br/><br/>But ever and anon of griefs subdued<br/>  There comes a token like a Scorpion's sting,<br/>  Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;<br/>  And slight withal may be the things which bring<br/>  Back on the heart the weight which it would fling<br/>  Aside for ever: it may be a sound--<br/>  A tone of music--summer's eve--or spring--<br/>  A flower--the wind--the Ocean--which shall wound,<br/>Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound;<br/><br/>And how and why we know not, nor can trace<br/>  Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,<br/>  But feel the shock renewed, nor can efface<br/>  The blight and blackening which it leaves behind,<br/>  Which out of things familiar, undesigned,<br/>  When least we deem of such, calls up to view<br/>  The Spectres whom no exorcism can bind,--<br/>  The cold--the changed--perchance the dead, anew--<br/>The mourned--the loved--the lost--too many! yet how few!<br/><br/>But my Soul wanders; I demand it back<br/>  To meditate amongst decay, and stand<br/>  A ruin amidst ruins; there to track<br/>  Fall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land<br/>  Which _was_ the mightiest in its old command,<br/>  And _is_ the loveliest, and must ever be<br/>  The master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand;<br/>  Wherein were cast the heroic and the free,--<br/>The beautiful--the brave--the Lords of earth and sea,<br/><br/>The Commonwealth of Kings--the Men of Rome!<br/>  And even since, and now, fair Italy!<br/>  Thou art the Garden of the World, the Home<br/>  Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;<br/>  Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?<br/>  Thy very weeds are beautiful--thy waste<br/>  More rich than other climes' fertility;<br/>  Thy wreck a glory--and thy ruin graced<br/>With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.<br/><br/>The Moon is up, and yet it is not night--<br/>  Sunset divides the sky with her--a sea<br/>  Of glory streams along the Alpine height<br/>  Of blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free<br/>  From clouds, but of all colours seems to be,--<br/>  Melted to one vast Iris of the West,--<br/>  Where the Day joins the past Eternity;<br/>  While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest<br/>Floats through the azure air--an island of the blest!<br/><br/>A single star is at her side, and reigns<br/>  With her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still<br/>  Yon sunny Sea heaves brightly, and remains<br/>  Rolled o'er the peak of the far Rh√¶tian hill,<br/>  As Day and Night contending were, until<br/>  Nature reclaimed her order:--gently flows<br/>  The deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil<br/>  The odorous purple of a new-born rose,<br/>Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,<br/><br/>Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,<br/>  Comes down upon the waters! all its hues,<br/>  From the rich sunset to the rising star,<br/>  Their magical variety diffuse:<br/>  And now they change--a paler Shadow strews<br/>  Its mantle o'er the mountains; parting Day<br/>  Dies like the Dolphin, whom each pang imbues<br/>  With a new colour as it gasps away--<br/>The last still loveliest, till--'tis gone--and all is gray.<br/><br/>There is a tomb in Arqua;--reared in air,<br/>  Pillared in their sarcophagus, repose<br/>  The bones of Laura's lover: here repair<br/>  Many familiar with his well-sung woes,<br/>  The Pilgrims of his Genius. He arose<br/>  To raise a language, and his land reclaim<br/>  From the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:<br/>  Watering the tree which bears his Lady's name<br/>With his melodious tears, he gave himself to Fame.<br/><br/>They keep his dust in Arqua, where he died--<br/>  The mountain-village where his latter days<br/>  Went down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride--<br/>  An honest pride--and let it be their praise,<br/>  To offer to the passing stranger's gaze<br/>  His mansion and his sepulchre--both plain<br/>  And venerably simple--such as raise<br/>  A feeling more accordant with his strain<br/>Than if a Pyramid formed his monumental fane.<br/><br/>And the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt<br/>  Is one of that complexion which seems made<br/>  For those who their mortality have felt,<br/>  And sought a refuge from their hopes decayed<br/>  In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,<br/>  Which shows a distant prospect far away<br/>  Of busy cities, now in vain displayed,<br/>  For they can lure no further; and the ray<br/>Of a bright Sun can make sufficient holiday,<br/><br/>Developing the mountains, leaves, and flowers,<br/>  And shining in the brawling brook, where-by,<br/>  Clear as its current, glide the sauntering hours<br/>  With a calm languor, which, though to the eye<br/>  Idlesse it seem, hath its morality--<br/>  If from society we learn to live,<br/>  'Tis Solitude should teach us how to die;<br/>  It hath no flatterers--Vanity can give<br/>No hollow aid; alone--man with his God must strive:<br/><br/>Or, it may be, with Demons, who impair<br/>  The strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey<br/>  In melancholy bosoms--such as were<br/>  Of moody texture from their earliest day,<br/>  And loved to dwell in darkness and dismay<br/>  Deeming themselves predestined to a doom<br/>  Which is not of the pangs that pass away;<br/>  Making the Sun like blood, the Earth a tomb,<br/>The tomb a hell--and Hell itself a murkier gloom.<br/><br/>Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,<br/>  Whose symmetry was not for solitude,<br/>  There seems as 'twere a curse upon the Seats<br/>  Of former Sovereigns, and the antique brood<br/>  Of Este, which for many an age made good<br/>  Its strength within thy walls, and was of yore<br/>  Patron or Tyrant, as the changing mood<br/>  Of petty power impelled, of those who wore<br/>The wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.<br/><br/>And Tasso is their glory and their shame--<br/>  Hark to his strain! and then survey his cell!<br/>  And see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,<br/>  And where Alfonso bade his poet dwell:<br/>  The miserable Despot could not quell<br/>  The insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend<br/>  With the surrounding maniacs, in the hell<br/>  Where he had plunged it. Glory without end<br/>Scattered the clouds away--and on that name attend<br/><br/>The tears and praises of all time, while thine<br/>  Would rot in its oblivion--in the sink<br/>  Of worthless dust, which from thy boasted line<br/>  Is shaken into nothing--but the link<br/>  Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think<br/>  Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn:<br/>  Alfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink<br/>  From thee! if in another station born,<br/>Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn:<br/><br/>_Thou!_ formed to eat, and be despised, and die,<br/>  Even as the beasts that perish--save that thou<br/>  Hadst a more splendid trough and wider sty:--<br/>  _He!_ with a glory round his furrowed brow,<br/>  Which emanated then, and dazzles now,<br/>  In face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,<br/>  And Boileau, whose rash envy could allow<br/>  No strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,<br/>That whetstone of the teeth--Monotony in wire!<br/><br/>Peace to Torquato's injured shade! 'twas his<br/>  In life and death to be the mark where Wrong<br/>  Aimed with her poisoned arrows,--but to miss.<br/>  Oh, Victor unsurpassed in modern song!<br/>  Each year brings forth its millions--but how long<br/>  The tide of Generations shall roll on,<br/>  And not the whole combined and countless throng<br/>  Compose a mind like thine? though all in one<br/>Condensed their scattered rays--they would not form a Sun.<br/><br/>Great as thou art, yet paralleled by those,<br/>  Thy countrymen, before thee born to shine,<br/>  The Bards of Hell and Chivalry: first rose<br/>  The Tuscan Father's Comedy Divine;<br/>  Then, not unequal to the Florentine,<br/>  The southern Scott, the minstrel who called forth<br/>  A new creation with his magic line,<br/>  And, like the Ariosto of the North,<br/>Sang Ladye-love and War, Romance and Knightly Worth.<br/><br/>The lightning rent from Ariosto's bust<br/>  The iron crown of laurel's mimicked leaves;<br/>  Nor was the ominous element unjust,<br/>  For the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves<br/>  Is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,<br/>  And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;<br/>  Yet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,<br/>  Know, that the lightning sanctifies below<br/>Whate'er it strikes;--yon head is doubly sacred now.<br/><br/>Italia! oh, Italia! thou who hast<br/>  The fatal gift of Beauty, which became<br/>  A funeral dower of present woes and past--<br/>  On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,<br/>  And annals graved in characters of flame.<br/>  Oh, God! that thou wert in thy nakedness<br/>  Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim<br/>  Thy right, and awe the robbers back, who press<br/>To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;<br/><br/>Then might'st thou more appal--or, less desired,<br/>  Be homely and be peaceful, undeplored<br/>  For thy destructive charms; then, still untired,<br/>  Would not be seen the arm√©d torrents poured<br/>  Down the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde<br/>  Of many-nationed spoilers from the Po<br/>  Quaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword<br/>  Be thy sad weapon of defence--and so,<br/>Victor or vanquished, thou the slave of friend or foe.<br/><br/>Wandering in youth, I traced the path of him,<br/>  The Roman friend of Rome's least-mortal mind,<br/>  The friend of Tully: as my bark did skim<br/>  The bright blue waters with a fanning wind,<br/>  Came Megara before me, and behind<br/>  √Ügina lay--Pir√¶us on the right,<br/>  And Corinth on the left; I lay reclined<br/>  Along the prow, and saw all these unite<br/>In ruin--even as he had seen the desolate sight;<br/><br/>For Time hath not rebuilt them, but upreared<br/>  Barbaric dwellings on their shattered site,<br/>  Which only make more mourned and more endeared<br/>  The few last rays of their far-scattered light,<br/>  And the crashed relics of their vanished might.<br/>  The Roman saw these tombs in his own age,<br/>  These sepulchres of cities, which excite<br/>  Sad wonder, and his yet surviving page<br/>The moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.<br/><br/>That page is now before me, and on mine<br/>  _His_ Country's ruin added to the mass<br/>  Of perished states he mourned in their decline,<br/>  And I in desolation: all that _was_<br/>  Of then destruction _is_; and now, alas!<br/>  Rome--Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,<br/>  In the same dust and blackness, and we pass<br/>  The skeleton of her Titanic form,<br/>Wrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.<br/><br/>Yet, Italy! through every other land<br/>  Thy wrongs should ring--and shall--from side to side;<br/>  Mother of Arts! as once of Arms! thy hand<br/>  Was then our Guardian, and is still our Guide;<br/>  Parent of our Religion! whom the wide<br/>  Nations have knelt to for the keys of Heaven!<br/>  Europe, repentant of her parricide,<br/>  Shall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,<br/>Roll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.<br/><br/>But Arno wins us to the fair white walls,<br/>  Where the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps<br/>  A softer feeling for her fairy halls:<br/>  Girt by her theatre of hills, she reaps<br/>  Her corn, and wine, and oil--and Plenty leaps<br/>  To laughing life, with her redundant Horn.<br/>  Along the banks where smiling Arno sweeps<br/>  Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,<br/>And buried Learning rose, redeemed to a new Morn.<br/><br/>There, too, the Goddess loves in stone, and fills<br/>  The air around with Beauty--we inhale<br/>  The ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils<br/>  Part of its immortality--the veil<br/>  Of heaven is half undrawn--within the pale<br/>  We stand, and in that form and face behold<br/>  What Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;<br/>  And to the fond Idolaters of old<br/>Envy the innate flash which such a Soul could mould:<br/><br/>We gaze and turn away, and know not where,<br/>  Dazzled and drunk with Beauty, till the heart<br/>  Reels with its fulness; there--for ever there--<br/>  Chained to the chariot of triumphal Art,<br/>  We stand as captives, and would not depart.<br/>  Away!--there need no words, nor terms precise,<br/>  The paltry jargon of the marble mart,<br/>  Where Pedantry gulls Folly--we have eyes:<br/>Blood--pulse--and breast confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.<br/><br/>Appear'dst thou not to Paris in this guise?<br/>  Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,<br/>  In all thy perfect Goddess-ship, when lies<br/>  Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?<br/>  And gazing in thy face as toward a star,<br/>  Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,<br/>  Feeding on thy sweet cheek! while thy lips are<br/>  With lava kisses melting while they burn,<br/>Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!<br/><br/>Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love--<br/>  Their full divinity inadequate<br/>  That feeling to express, or to improve--<br/>  The Gods become as mortals--and man's fate<br/>  Has moments like their brightest; but the weight<br/>  Of earth recoils upon us;--let it go!<br/>  We can recall such visions, and create,<br/>  From what has been, or might be, things which grow<br/>Into thy statue's form, and look like gods below.<br/><br/>I leave to learn√©d fingers, and wise hands,<br/>  The Artist and his Ape, to teach and tell<br/>  How well his Connoisseurship understands<br/>  The graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:<br/>  Let these describe the undescribable:<br/>  I would not their vile breath should crisp the stream<br/>  Wherein that Image shall for ever dwell--<br/>  The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream<br/>That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.<br/><br/>In Santa Croce's holy precincts lie<br/>  Ashes which make it holier, dust which is<br/>  Even in itself an immortality,<br/>  Though there were nothing save the past, and this,<br/>  The particle of those sublimities<br/>  Which have relapsed to chaos:--here repose<br/>  Angelo's--Alfieri's bones--and his,<br/>  The starry Galileo, with his woes;<br/>Here Machiavelli's earth returned to whence it rose.<br/><br/>These are four minds, which, like the elements,<br/>  Might furnish forth creation:--Italy!<br/>  Time, which hath wronged thee with ten thousand rents<br/>  Of thine imperial garment, shall deny<br/>  And hath denied, to every other sky,<br/>  Spirits which soar from ruin:--thy Decay<br/>  Is still impregnate with divinity,<br/>  Which gilds it with revivifying ray;<br/>Such as the great of yore, Canova is to-day.<br/><br/>But where repose the all Etruscan three--<br/>  Dante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less than they,<br/>  The Bard of Prose, creative Spirit! he<br/>  Of the Hundred Tales of Love--where did they lay<br/>  Their bones, distinguished from our common clay<br/>  In death as life? Are they resolved to dust,<br/>  And have their Country's Marbles nought to say?<br/>  Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?<br/>Did they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?<br/><br/>Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,<br/>  Like Scipio buried by the upbraiding shore:<br/>  Thy factions, in their worse than civil war,<br/>  Proscribed the Bard whose name for evermore<br/>  Their children's children would in vain adore<br/>  With the remorse of ages; and the crown<br/>  Which Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,<br/>  Upon a far and foreign soil had grown,<br/>His Life, his Fame, his Grave, though rifled--not thine own.<br/><br/>Boccaccio to his parent earth bequeathed<br/>  His dust,--and lies it not her Great among,<br/>  With many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed<br/>  O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?<br/>  That music in itself, whose sounds are song,<br/>  The poetry of speech? No;--even his tomb<br/>  Uptorn, must bear the hy√¶na bigot's wrong,<br/>  No more amidst the meaner dead find room,<br/>Nor claim a passing sigh, because it told for _whom!_<br/><br/>And Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;<br/>  Yet for this want more noted, as of yore<br/>  The C√¶sar's pageant, shorn of Brutus' bust,<br/>  Did but of Rome's best Son remind her more:<br/>  Happier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,<br/>  Fortress of falling Empire! honoured sleeps<br/>  The immortal Exile;--Arqua, too, her store<br/>  Of tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,<br/>While Florence vainly begs her banished dead and weeps.<br/><br/>What is her Pyramid of precious stones?<br/>  Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues<br/>  Of gem and marble, to encrust the bones<br/>  Of merchant-dukes? the momentary dews<br/>  Which, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse<br/>  Freshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,<br/>  Whose names are Mausoleums of the Muse,<br/>  Are gently prest with far more reverent tread<br/>Than ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.<br/><br/>There be more things to greet the heart and eyes<br/>  In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,<br/>  Where Sculpture with her rainbow Sister vies;<br/>  There be more marvels yet--but not for mine;<br/>  For I have been accustomed to entwine<br/>  My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields,<br/>  Than Art in galleries: though a work divine<br/>  Calls for my Spirit's homage, yet it yields<br/>Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields<br/><br/>Is of another temper, and I roam<br/>  By Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles<br/>  Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;<br/>  For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles<br/>  Come back before me, as his skill beguiles<br/>  The host between the mountains and the shore,<br/>  Where Courage falls in her despairing files,<br/>  And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,<br/>Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er.<br/><br/>Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;<br/>  And such the storm of battle on this day,<br/>  And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds<br/>  To all save Carnage, that, beneath the fray,<br/>  An Earthquake reeled unheededly away!<br/>  None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,<br/>  And yawning forth a grave for those who lay<br/>  Upon their bucklers for a winding sheet--<br/>Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet!<br/><br/>The Earth to them was as a rolling bark<br/>  Which bore them to Eternity--they saw<br/>  The Ocean round, but had no time to mark<br/>  The motions of their vessel; Nature's law,<br/>  In them suspended, recked not of the awe<br/>  Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds<br/>  Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw<br/>  From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds<br/>Stumble o'er heaving plains--and Man's dread hath no words.<br/><br/>Far other scene is Thrasimene now;<br/>  Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain<br/>  Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;<br/>  Her ag√©d trees rise thick as once the slain<br/>  Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en--<br/>  A little rill of scanty stream and bed--<br/>  A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;<br/>  And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead<br/>Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red.<br/><br/>But thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave<br/>  Of the most living crystal that was e'er<br/>  The haunt of river-Nymph, to gaze and lave<br/>  Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear<br/>  Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer<br/>  Grazes--the purest God of gentle waters!<br/>  And most serene of aspect, and most clear;<br/>  Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters--<br/>A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!<br/><br/>And on thy happy shore a Temple still,<br/>  Of small and delicate proportion, keeps<br/>  Upon a mild declivity of hill,<br/>  Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps<br/>  Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps<br/>  The finny darter with the glittering scales,<br/>  Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;<br/>  While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails<br/>Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.<br/><br/>Pass not unblest the Genius of the place!<br/>  If through the air a Zephyr more serene<br/>  Win to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace<br/>  Along his margin a more eloquent green,<br/>  If on the heart the freshness of the scene<br/>  Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust<br/>  Of weary life a moment lave it clean<br/>  With Nature's baptism,--'tis to him ye must<br/>Pay orisons for this suspension of disgust.<br/><br/>The roar of waters!--from the headlong height<br/>  Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;<br/>  The fall of waters! rapid as the light<br/>  The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;<br/>  The Hell of Waters! where they howl and hiss,<br/>  And boil in endless torture; while the sweat<br/>  Of their great agony, wrung out from this<br/>  Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet<br/>That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,<br/><br/>And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again<br/>  Returns in an unceasing shower, which round,<br/>  With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,<br/>  Is an eternal April to the ground,<br/>  Making it all one emerald:--how profound<br/>  The gulf! and how the Giant Element<br/>  From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,<br/>  Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent<br/>With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent<br/><br/>To the broad column which rolls on, and shows<br/>  More like the fountain of an infant sea<br/>  Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes<br/>  Of a new world, than only thus to be<br/>  Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,<br/>  With many windings, through the vale:--Look back!<br/>  Lo! where it comes like an Eternity,<br/>  As if to sweep down all things in its track,<br/>Charming the eye with dread,--a matchless cataract,<br/><br/>Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,<br/>  From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,<br/>  An Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,<br/>  Like Hope upon a death-bed, and, unworn<br/>  Its steady dyes, while all around is torn<br/>  By the distracted waters, bears serene<br/>  Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:<br/>  Resembling, 'mid the torture of the scene,<br/>Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.<br/><br/>Once more upon the woody Apennine--<br/>  The infant Alps, which--had I not before<br/>  Gazed on their mightier Parents, where the pine<br/>  Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar<br/>  The thundering Lauwine--might be worshipped more;<br/>  But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear<br/>  Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar<br/>  Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near--<br/>And in Chimari heard the Thunder-Hills of fear,<br/><br/>Th' Acroceraunian mountains of old name;<br/>  And on Parnassus seen the Eagles fly<br/>  Like Spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame.<br/>  For still they soared unutterably high:<br/>  I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;<br/>  Athos--Olympus--√Ütna.--Atlas--made<br/>  These hills seem things of lesser dignity;<br/>  All, save the lone Soracte's height, displayed<br/>Not _now_ in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid<br/><br/>For our remembrance, and from out the plain<br/>  Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break,<br/>  And on the curl hangs pausing: not in vain<br/>  May he, who will, his recollections rake,<br/>  And quote in classic raptures, and awake<br/>  The hills with Latian echoes--I abhorred<br/>  Too much, to conquer for the Poet's sake,<br/>  The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word<br/>In my repugnant youth, with pleasure to record<br/><br/>Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned<br/>  My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught<br/>  My mind to meditate what then it learned,<br/>  Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought<br/>  By the impatience of my early thought,<br/>  That, with the freshness wearing out before<br/>  My mind could relish what it might have sought,<br/>  If free to choose, I cannot now restore<br/>Its health--but what it then detested, still abhor.<br/><br/>Then farewell, Horace--whom I hated so,<br/>  Not for thy faults, but mine: it is a curse<br/>  To understand, not feel thy lyric flow,<br/>  To comprehend, but never love thy verse;<br/>  Although no deeper Moralist rehearse<br/>  Our little life, nor Bard prescribe his art,<br/>  Nor livelier Satirist the conscience pierce,<br/>  Awakening without wounding the touched heart,<br/>Yet fare thee well--upon Soracte's ridge we part.<br/><br/>Oh, Rome!

Thou, who didst subdue<br/>  Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel<br/>  The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due<br/>  Of hoarded vengeance till thine Eagles flew<br/>  O'er prostrate Asia;--thou, who with thy frown<br/>  Annihilated senates;--Roman, too,<br/>  With all thy vices--for thou didst lay down<br/>With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown,<br/><br/>Thy dictatorial wreath--couldst thou divine<br/>  To what would one day dwindle that which made<br/>  Thee more than mortal? and that so supine<br/>  By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?<br/>  She who was named Eternal, and arrayed<br/>  Her warriors but to conquer--she who veiled<br/>  Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed,<br/>  Until the o'er-canopied horizon failed,<br/>Her rushing wings--Oh! she who was Almighty hailed!<br/><br/>Sylla was first of victors; but our own,<br/>  The sagest of usurpers, Cromwell!--he<br/>  Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne<br/>  Down to a block--immortal rebel!

Can Nature show so fair?<br/>  Where are the charms and virtues which we dare<br/>  Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,<br/>  The unreached Paradise of our despair,<br/>  Which o'er-informs the pencil and the pen,<br/>And overpowers the page where it would bloom again?<br/><br/>Who loves, raves--'tis youth's frenzy--but the cure<br/>  Is bitterer still, as charm by charm unwinds<br/>  Which robed our idols, and we see too sure<br/>  Nor Worth nor Beauty dwells from out the mind's<br/>  Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds<br/>  The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,<br/>  Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;<br/>  The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,<br/>Seems ever near the prize--wealthiest when most undone.<br/><br/>We wither from our youth, we gasp away--<br/>  Sick--sick; unfound the boon--unslaked the thirst,<br/>  Though to the last, in verge of our decay,<br/>  Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first--<br/>  But all too late,--so are we doubly curst.<br/>  Love, Fame, Ambition, Avarice--'tis the same,<br/>  Each idle--and all ill--and none the worst--<br/>  For all are meteors with a different name,<br/>And Death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.<br/><br/>Few--none--find what they love or could have loved,<br/>  Though accident, blind contact, and the strong<br/>  Necessity of loving, have removed<br/>  Antipathies--but to recur, ere long,<br/>  Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;<br/>  And Circumstance, that unspiritual God<br/>  And Miscreator, makes and helps along<br/>  Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,<br/>Whose touch turns Hope to dust,--the dust we all have trod.<br/><br/>Our life is a false nature--'tis not in<br/>  The harmony of things,--this hard decree,<br/>  This uneradicable taint of Sin,<br/>  This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree,<br/>  Whose root is Earth--whose leaves and branches be<br/>  The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew--<br/>  Disease, death, bondage--all the woes we see,<br/>  And worse, the woes we see not--which throb through<br/>The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.<br/><br/>Yet let us ponder boldly--'tis a base<br/>  Abandonment of reason to resign<br/>  Our right of thought--our last and only place<br/>  Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:<br/>  Though from our birth the Faculty divine<br/>  Is chained and tortured--cabined, cribbed, confined,<br/>  And bred in darkness, lest the Truth should shine<br/>  Too brightly on the unprepar√©d mind,<br/>The beam pours in--for Time and Skill will couch the blind.<br/><br/>Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,<br/>  Collecting the chief trophies of her line,<br/>  Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,<br/>  Her Coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine<br/>  As 'twere its natural torches--for divine<br/>  Should be the light which streams here,--to illume<br/>  This long-explored but still exhaustless mine<br/>  Of Contemplation; and the azure gloom<br/>Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume<br/><br/>Hues which have words, and speak to ye of Heaven,<br/>  Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,<br/>  And shadows forth its glory. There is given<br/>  Unto the things of earth, which Time hath bent,<br/>  A Spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant<br/>  His hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power<br/>  And magic in the ruined battlement,<br/>  For which the Palace of the present hour<br/>Must yield its pomp, and wait till Ages are its dower.<br/><br/>Oh, Time! the Beautifier of the dead,<br/>  Adorner of the ruin--Comforter<br/>  And only Healer when the heart hath bled;<br/>  Time! the Corrector where our judgments err,<br/>  The test of Truth, Love--sole philosopher,<br/>  For all beside are sophists--from thy thrift,<br/>  Which never loses though it doth defer--<br/>  Time, the Avenger! unto thee I lift<br/>My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:<br/><br/>Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine<br/>  And temple more divinely desolate--<br/>  Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,<br/>  Ruins of years--though few, yet full of fate:--<br/>  If thou hast ever seen me too elate,<br/>  Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne<br/>  Good, and reserved my pride against the hate<br/>  Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn<br/>This iron in my soul in vain--shall _they_ not mourn?<br/><br/>And Thou, who never yet of human wrong<br/>  Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!<br/>  Here, where the ancient paid thee homage long--<br/>  Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,<br/>  And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss<br/>  For that unnatural retribution--just,<br/>  Had it but been from hands less near--in this<br/>  Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!<br/>Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake! thou shalt, and must.<br/><br/>It is not that I may not have incurred,<br/>  For my ancestral faults or mine, the wound<br/>  I bleed withal; and, had it been conferred<br/>  With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound;<br/>  But now my blood shall not sink in the ground--<br/>  To thee I do devote it--_Thou_ shalt take<br/>  The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found--<br/>  Which if _I_ have not taken for the sake--<br/>But let that pass--I sleep--but Thou shalt yet awake.<br/><br/>And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now<br/>  I shrink from what is suffered: let him speak<br/>  Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,<br/>  Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;<br/>  But in this page a record will I seek.<br/>  Not in the air shall these my words disperse,<br/>  Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak<br/>  The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,<br/>And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!<br/><br/>That curse shall be Forgiveness.--Have I not--<br/>  Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!--<br/>  Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?<br/>  Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?<br/>  Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,<br/>  Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?<br/>  And only not to desperation driven,<br/>  Because not altogether of such clay<br/>As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.<br/><br/>From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy<br/>  Have I not seen what human things could do?<br/>  From the loud roar of foaming calumny<br/>  To the small whisper of the as paltry few--<br/>  And subtler venom of the reptile crew,<br/>  The Janus glance of whose significant eye,<br/>  Learning to lie with silence, would _seem_ true--<br/>  And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,<br/>Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.<br/><br/>But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:<br/>  My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,<br/>  And my frame perish even in conquering pain;<br/>  But there is that within me which shall tire<br/>  Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire;<br/>  Something unearthly, which they deem not of,<br/>  Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,<br/>  Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move<br/>In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of Love.<br/><br/>The seal is set.--Now welcome, thou dread Power!<br/>  Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here<br/>  Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour<br/>  With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear;<br/>  Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear<br/>  Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene<br/>  Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear<br/>  That we become a part of what has been,<br/>And grow upon the spot--all-seeing but unseen.<br/><br/>And here the buzz of eager nations ran,<br/>  In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,<br/>  As man was slaughtered by his fellow man.<br/>  And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because<br/>  Such were the bloody Circus' genial laws,<br/>  And the imperial pleasure.--Wherefore not?<br/>  What matters where we fall to fill the maws<br/>  Of worms--on battle-plains or listed spot?<br/>Both are but theatres--where the chief actors rot.<br/><br/>I see before me the Gladiator lie:<br/>  He leans upon his hand--his manly brow<br/>  Consents to death, but conquers agony,<br/>  And his drooped head sinks gradually low--<br/>  And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow<br/>  From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,<br/>  Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now<br/>  The arena swims around him--he is gone,<br/>Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.<br/><br/>He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes<br/>  Were with his heart--and that was far away;<br/>  He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,<br/>  But where his rude hut by the Danube lay--<br/>  _There_ were his young barbarians all at play,<br/>  _There_ was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,<br/>  Butchered to make a Roman holiday--<br/>  All this rushed with his blood--Shall he expire<br/>And unavenged?--Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!<br/><br/>But here, where Murder breathed her bloody steam;--<br/>  And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,<br/>  And roared or murmured like a mountain stream<br/>  Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;<br/>  Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise<br/>  Was Death or Life--the playthings of a crowd--<br/>  My voice sounds much--and fall the stars' faint rays<br/>  On the arena void--seats crushed--walls bowed--<br/>And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.<br/><br/>A Ruin--yet what Ruin! from its mass<br/>  Walls--palaces--half-cities, have been reared;<br/>  Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,<br/>  And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.<br/>  Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?<br/>  Alas! developed, opens the decay,<br/>  When the colossal fabric's form is neared:<br/>  It will not bear the brightness of the day,<br/>Which streams too much on all--years--man--have reft away.<br/><br/>But when the rising moon begins to climb<br/>  Its topmost arch, and gently pauses there--<br/>  When the stars twinkle through the loops of Time,<br/>  And the low night-breeze waves along the air<br/>  The garland-forest, which the gray walls wear,<br/>  Like laurels on the bald first C√¶sar's head--<br/>  When the light shines serene but doth not glare--<br/>  Then in this magic circle raise the dead;--<br/>Heroes have trod this spot--'tis on their dust ye tread.<br/><br/>"While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand:<br/>  When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;<br/>  And when Rome falls--the World." From our own land<br/>  Thus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall<br/>  In Saxon times, which we are wont to call<br/>  Ancient; and these three mortal things are still<br/>  On their foundations, and unaltered all--<br/>  Rome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill--<br/>The World--the same wide den--of thieves, or what ye will.<br/><br/>Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime--<br/>  Shrine of all saints and temple of all Gods,<br/>  From Jove to Jesus--spared and blest by Time--<br/>  Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods<br/>  Arch--empire--each thing round thee--and Man plods<br/>  His way through thorns to ashes--glorious Dome!<br/>  Shalt thou not last? Time's scythe and Tyrants' rods<br/>  Shiver upon thee--sanctuary and home<br/>Of Art and Piety--Pantheon!--pride of Rome!<br/><br/>Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts!<br/>  Despoiled yet perfect! with thy circle spreads<br/>  A holiness appealing to all hearts;<br/>  To Art a model--and to him who treads<br/>  Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds<br/>  Her light through thy sole aperture; to those<br/>  Who worship, here are altars for their beads--<br/>  And they who feel for Genius may repose<br/>Their eyes on honoured forms, whose busts around them close.<br/><br/>There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light<br/>  What do I gaze on? Nothing--Look again!<br/>  Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight--<br/>  Two insulated phantoms of the brain:<br/>  It is not so--I see them full and plain--<br/>  An old man, and a female young and fair,<br/>  Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein<br/>  The blood is nectar:--but what doth she there,<br/>With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?<br/><br/>Full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,<br/>  Where _on_ the heart and _from_ the heart we took<br/>  Our first and sweetest nurture--when the wife,<br/>  Blest into mother, in the innocent look,<br/>  Or even the piping cry of lips that brook<br/>  No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives<br/>  Man knows not--when from out its cradled nook<br/>  She sees her little bud put forth its leaves--<br/>What may the fruit be yet?--I know not--Cain was Eve's.<br/><br/>But here Youth offers to Old Age the food,<br/>  The milk of his own gift: it is her Sire<br/>  To whom she renders back the debt of blood<br/>  Born with her birth:--No--he shall not expire<br/>  While in those warm and lovely veins the fire<br/>  Of health and holy feeling can provide<br/>  Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher<br/>  Than Egypt's river:--from that gentle side<br/>Drink--drink, and live--Old Man! Heaven's realm holds no such tide.<br/><br/>The starry fable of the Milky Way<br/>  Has not thy story's purity; it is<br/>  A constellation of a sweeter ray,<br/>  And sacred Nature triumphs more in this<br/>  Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss<br/>  Where sparkle distant worlds:--Oh, holiest Nurse!<br/>  No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss<br/>  To thy Sire's heart, replenishing its source<br/>With life, as our freed souls rejoin the Universe.<br/><br/>Turn to the Mole which Hadrian reared on high,<br/>  Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,<br/>  Colossal copyist of deformity--<br/>  Whose travelled phantasy from the far Nile's<br/>  Enormous model, doomed the artist's toils<br/>  To build for Giants, and for his vain earth,<br/>  His shrunken ashes, raise this Dome: How smiles<br/>  The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,<br/>To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!<br/><br/>But lo! the Dome--the vast and wondrous Dome,<br/>  To which Diana's marvel was a cell--<br/>  Christ's mighty shrine above His martyr's tomb!<br/>  I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle--<br/>  Its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell<br/>  The hy√¶na and the jackal in their shade;<br/>  I have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell<br/>  Their glittering mass i' the Sun, and have surveyed<br/>Its sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem prayed;<br/><br/>But thou, of temples old, or altars new,<br/>  Standest alone--with nothing like to thee--<br/>  Worthiest of God, the Holy and the True!<br/>  Since Zion's desolation, when that He<br/>  Forsook his former city, what could be,<br/>  Of earthly structures, in His honour piled,<br/>  Of a sublimer aspect? Majesty--<br/>  Power--Glory--Strength--and Beauty all are aisled<br/>In this eternal Ark of worship undefiled.<br/><br/>Enter: its grandeur overwhelms thee not;<br/>  And why? it is not lessened--but thy mind,<br/>  Expanded by the Genius of the spot,<br/>  Has grown colossal, and can only find<br/>  A fit abode wherein appear enshrined<br/>  Thy hopes of Immortality--and thou<br/>  Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined<br/>  See thy God face to face, as thou dost now<br/>His Holy of Holies--nor be blasted by his brow.<br/><br/>Thou movest--but increasing with the advance,<br/>  Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,<br/>  Deceived by its gigantic elegance--<br/>  Vastness which grows, but grows to harmonize--<br/>  All musical in its immensities;<br/>  Rich marbles, richer painting--shrines where flame<br/>  The lamps of gold--and haughty dome which vies<br/>  In air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame<br/>Sits on the firm-set ground--and this the clouds must claim.<br/><br/>Thou seest not all--but piecemeal thou must break,<br/>  To separate contemplation, the great whole;<br/>  And as the Ocean many bays will make<br/>  That ask the eye--so here condense thy soul<br/>  To more immediate objects, and control<br/>  Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart<br/>  Its eloquent proportions, and unroll<br/>  In mighty graduations, part by part,<br/>The Glory which at once upon thee did not dart,<br/><br/>Not by its fault--but thine: Our outward sense<br/>  Is but of gradual grasp--and as it is<br/>  That what we have of feeling most intense<br/>  Outstrips our faint expression; even so this<br/>  Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice<br/>  Fools our fond gaze, and greatest of the great<br/>  Defies at first our Nature's littleness,<br/>  Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate<br/>Our Spirits to the size of that they contemplate.<br/><br/>Then pause, and be enlightened; there is more<br/>  In such a survey than the sating gaze<br/>  Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore<br/>  The worship of the place, or the mere praise<br/>  Of Art and its great Masters, who could raise<br/>  What former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan:<br/>  The fountain of Sublimity displays<br/>  Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of Man<br/>Its golden sands, and learn what great Conceptions can.<br/><br/>Or, turning to the Vatican, go see<br/>  Laoco√∂n's torture dignifying pain--<br/>  A Father's love and Mortal's agony<br/>  With an Immortal's patience blending:--Vain<br/>  The struggle--vain, against the coiling strain<br/>  And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,<br/>  The Old Man's clench; the long envenomed chain<br/>  Rivets the living links,--the enormous Asp<br/>Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.<br/><br/>Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,<br/>  The God of Life, and Poesy, and Light--<br/>  The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow<br/>  All radiant from his triumph in the fight;<br/>  The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright<br/>  With an Immortal's vengeance--in his eye<br/>  And nostril beautiful Disdain, and Might<br/>  And Majesty, flash their full lightnings by,<br/>Developing in that one glance the Deity.<br/><br/>But in his delicate form--a dream of Love,<br/>  Shaped by some solitary Nymph, whose breast<br/>  Longed for a deathless lover from above,<br/>  And maddened in that vision--are exprest<br/>  All that ideal Beauty ever blessed<br/>  The mind with in its most unearthly mood,<br/>  When each Conception was a heavenly Guest--<br/>  A ray of Immortality--and stood,<br/>Starlike, around, until they gathered to a God!<br/><br/>And if it be Prometheus stole from Heaven<br/>  The fire which we endure--it was repaid<br/>  By him to whom the energy was given<br/>  Which this poetic marble hath arrayed<br/>  With an eternal Glory--which, if made<br/>  By human hands, is not of human thought--<br/>  And Time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid<br/>  One ringlet in the dust--nor hath it caught<br/>A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.<br/><br/>But where is he, the Pilgrim of my Song,<br/>  The Being who upheld it through the past?<br/>  Methinks he cometh late and tarries long.<br/>  He is no more--these breathings are his last--<br/>  His wanderings done--his visions ebbing fast,<br/>  And he himself as nothing:--if he was<br/>  Aught but a phantasy, and could be classed<br/>  With forms which live and suffer--let that pass--<br/>His shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,<br/><br/>Which gathers shadow--substance--life, and all<br/>  That we inherit in its mortal shroud--<br/>  And spreads the dim and universal pall<br/>  Through which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud<br/>  Between us sinks and all which ever glowed,<br/>  Till Glory's self is twilight, and displays<br/>  A melancholy halo scarce allowed<br/>  To hover on the verge of darkness--rays<br/>Sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,<br/><br/>And send us prying into the abyss,<br/>  To gather what we shall be when the frame<br/>  Shall be resolved to something less than this--<br/>  Its wretched essence; and to dream of fame,<br/>  And wipe the dust from off the idle name<br/>  We never more shall hear,--but never more,<br/>  Oh, happier thought! can we be made the same:--<br/>  It is enough in sooth that _once_ we bore<br/>These fardels of the heart--the heart whose sweat was gore.<br/><br/>Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,<br/>  A long low distant murmur of dread sound,<br/>  Such as arises when a nation bleeds<br/>  With some deep and immedicable wound;--<br/>  Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground--<br/>  The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the Chief<br/>  Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,<br/>  And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief--<br/>She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.<br/><br/>Scion of Chiefs and Monarchs, where art thou?<br/>  Fond Hope of many nations, art thou dead?<br/>  Could not the Grave forget thee, and lay low<br/>  Some less majestic, less belov√©d head?<br/>  In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,<br/>  The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,<br/>  Death hushed that pang for ever: with thee fled<br/>  The present happiness and promised joy<br/>Which filled the Imperial Isles so full it seemed to cloy.<br/><br/>Peasants bring forth in safety.--Can it be,<br/>  Oh thou that wert so happy, so adored!<br/>  Those who weep not for Kings shall weep for thee,<br/>  And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard<br/>  Her many griefs for _One_; for she had poured<br/>  Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head<br/>  Beheld her Iris.--Thou, too, lonely Lord,<br/>  And desolate Consort--vainly wert thou wed!<br/>The husband of a year! the father of the dead!<br/><br/>Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made;<br/>  Thy bridal's fruit is ashes: in the dust<br/>  The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,<br/>  The love of millions! How we did entrust<br/>  Futurity to her! and, though it must<br/>  Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed<br/>  Our children should obey her child, and blessed<br/>  Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed<br/>Like stars to shepherd's eyes:--'twas but a meteor beamed.<br/><br/>Woe unto us--not her--for she sleeps well:<br/>  The fickle reek of popular breath, the tongue<br/>  Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,<br/>  Which from the birth of Monarchy hath rung<br/>  Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstung<br/>  Nations have armed in madness--the strange fate<br/>  Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns, and hath flung<br/>  Against their blind omnipotence a weight<br/>Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late,--<br/><br/>These might have been her destiny--but no--<br/>  Our hearts deny it: and so young, so fair,<br/>  Good without effort, great without a foe;<br/>  But now a Bride and Mother--and now _there!_<br/>  How many ties did that stern moment tear!<br/>  From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast<br/>  Is linked the electric chain of that despair,<br/>  Whose shock was as an Earthquake's, and opprest<br/>The land which loved thee so that none could love thee best.<br/><br/>Lo, Nemi! navelled in the woody hills<br/>  So far, that the uprooting Wind which tears<br/>  The oak from his foundation, and which spills<br/>  The Ocean o'er its boundary, and bears<br/>  Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares<br/>  The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;<br/>  And calm as cherished hate, its surface wears<br/>  A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,<br/>All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.<br/><br/>And near, Albano's scarce divided waves<br/>  Shine from a sister valley;--and afar<br/>  The Tiber winds, and the broad Ocean laves<br/>  The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,<br/>  "Arms and the Man," whose re-ascending star<br/>  Rose o'er an empire:--but beneath thy right<br/>  Tully reposed from Rome;--and where yon bar<br/>  Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight<br/>The Sabine farm was tilled, the weary Bard's delight.<br/><br/>But I forget.--My Pilgrim's shrine is won,<br/>  And he and I must part,--so let it be,--<br/>  His task and mine alike are nearly done;<br/>  Yet once more let us look upon the Sea;<br/>  The Midland Ocean breaks on him and me,<br/>  And from the Alban Mount we now behold<br/>  Our friend of youth, that Ocean, which when we<br/>  Beheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold<br/>Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled<br/><br/>Upon the blue Symplegades: long years--<br/>  Long, though not very many--since have done<br/>  Their work on both; some suffering and some tears<br/>  Have left us nearly where we had begun:<br/>  Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run--<br/>  We have had our reward--and it is here,--<br/>  That we can yet feel gladdened by the Sun,<br/>  And reap from Earth--Sea--joy almost as dear<br/>As if there were no Man to trouble what is clear.<br/><br/>Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,<br/>  With one fair Spirit for my minister,<br/>  That I might all forget the human race,<br/>  And, hating no one, love but only her!<br/>  Ye elements!--in whose ennobling stir<br/>  I feel myself exalted--Can ye not<br/>  Accord me such a Being? Do I err<br/>  In deeming such inhabit many a spot?<br/>Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.<br/><br/>There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br/>  There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br/>  There is society, where none intrudes,<br/>  By the deep Sea, and Music in its roar:<br/>  I love not Man the less, but Nature more,<br/>  From these our interviews, in which I steal<br/>  From all I may be, or have been before,<br/>  To mingle with the Universe, and feel<br/>What I can ne'er express--yet can not all conceal.<br/><br/>Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!<br/>  Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;<br/>  Man marks the earth with ruin--his control<br/>  Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain<br/>  The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain<br/>  A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,<br/>  When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,<br/>  He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan--<br/>Without a grave--unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.<br/><br/>His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields<br/>  Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise<br/>  And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields<br/>  For Earth's destruction thou dost all despise,<br/>  Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies--<br/>  And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray<br/>  And howling, to his Gods, where haply lies<br/>  His petty hope in some near port or bay,<br/>And dashest him again to Earth:--there let him lay.<br/><br/>The armaments which thunderstrike the walls<br/>  Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,<br/>  And Monarchs tremble in their Capitals,<br/>  The oak Leviathans, whose huge ribs make<br/>  Their clay creator the vain title take<br/>  Of Lord of thee, and Arbiter of War--<br/>  These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,<br/>  They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar<br/>Alike the Armada's pride or spoils of Trafalgar.<br/><br/>Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--<br/>  Assyria--Greece--Rome--Carthage--what are they?<br/>  Thy waters washed them power while they were free,<br/>  And many a tyrant since; their shores obey<br/>  The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay<br/>  Has dried up realms to deserts:--not so thou,<br/>  Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play,<br/>  Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow--<br/>Such as Creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.<br/><br/>Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form<br/>  Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,<br/>  Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm--<br/>  Icing the Pole, or in the torrid clime<br/>  Dark-heaving--boundless, endless, and sublime--<br/>  The image of Eternity-the throne<br/>  Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime<br/>  The monsters of the deep are made--each Zone<br/>Obeys thee--thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.<br/><br/>And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy<br/>  Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be<br/>  Borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy<br/>  I wantoned with thy breakers--they to me<br/>  Were a delight; and if the freshening sea<br/>  Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,<br/>  For I was as it were a Child of thee,<br/>  And trusted to thy billows far and near,<br/>And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.<br/><br/>My task is done--my song hath ceased--my theme<br/>  Has died into an echo; it is fit<br/>  The spell should break of this protracted dream.<br/>  The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit<br/>  My midnight lamp--and what is writ, is writ,--<br/>  Would it were worthier! but I am not now<br/>  That which I have been--and my visions flit<br/>  Less palpably before me--and the glow<br/>Which in my Spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.<br/><br/>Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been--<br/>  A sound which makes us linger;--yet--farewell!<br/>  Ye! who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene<br/>  Which is his last--if in your memories dwell<br/>  A thought which once was his--if on ye swell<br/>  A single recollection--not in vain<br/>  He wore his sandal-shoon, and scallop-shell;<br/>  Farewell! with _him_ alone may rest the pain,<br/>If such there were--with _you_, the Moral of his Strain.
