<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Song of the Broad-Axe. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    1<br/>WEAPON, shapely, naked, wan!<br/>Head from the mother‚Äôs bowels drawn!<br/>Wooded flesh and metal bone! limb only one, and lip only one!<br/>Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve produced from a little seed sown!<br/>Resting the grass amid and upon,<br/>To be lean‚Äôd, and to lean on.<br/><br/>Strong shapes, and attributes of strong shapes‚Äîmasculine trades, sights and sounds;<br/>Long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music;<br/>Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ.<br/><br/>2<br/>Welcome are all earth‚Äôs lands, each for its kind;<br/>Welcome are lands of pine and oak;<br/>Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig;<br/>Welcome are lands of gold;<br/>Welcome are lands of wheat and maize‚Äîwelcome those of the grape;<br/>Welcome are lands of sugar and rice;<br/>Welcome the cotton-lands‚Äîwelcome those of the white potato and sweet potato;<br/>Welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies;<br/>Welcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands, openings;<br/>Welcome the measureless grazing-lands‚Äîwelcome the teeming soil of orchards, flax, honey,<br/>    hemp;<br/><br/>Welcome just as much the other more hard-faced lands;<br/>Lands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit lands;<br/>Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores;<br/>Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc;<br/>LANDS OF IRON! lands of the make of the axe!<br/><br/>3<br/>The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it;<br/>The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear‚Äôd for a garden,<br/>The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after the storm is lull‚Äôd,<br/>The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,<br/>The thought of ships struck in the storm, and put on their beam ends, and the cutting away<br/>    of<br/>  masts;<br/><br/>The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion‚Äôd houses and barns;<br/>The remember‚Äôd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men, families, goods,<br/>The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,<br/>The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it‚Äîthe outset anywhere,<br/>The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,<br/>The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle-bags;<br/>The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,<br/>The beauty of wood-boys and wood-men, with their clear untrimm‚Äôd faces,<br/>The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,<br/>The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience of restraint,<br/><br/>The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the solidification;<br/>The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and sloops, the raftsman,<br/>    the<br/>  pioneer,<br/>Lumbermen in their winter camp, day-break in the woods, stripes of snow on the limbs of<br/>    trees,<br/>  the<br/>  occasional snapping,<br/>The glad clear sound of one‚Äôs own voice, the merry song, the natural life of the woods,<br/>    the<br/>  strong<br/>  day‚Äôs work,<br/>The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of hemlock boughs,<br/>    and<br/>  the<br/>  bear-skin;<br/>‚ÄîThe house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,<br/>The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,<br/>The hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them regular,<br/>Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises, according as they were prepared,<br/>The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curv‚Äôd limbs,<br/>Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by posts and braces,<br/>The hook‚Äôd arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,<br/>The floor-men forcing the planks close, to be nail‚Äôd,<br/>Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,<br/>The echoes resounding through the vacant building;<br/>The huge store-house carried up in the city, well under way,<br/>The six framing-men, two in the middle, and two at each end, carefully bearing on their<br/>  shoulders a<br/>  heavy stick for a cross-beam,<br/>The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands, rapidly laying the long<br/>  side-wall, two<br/>  hundred feet from front to rear,<br/>The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels striking the<br/>    bricks,<br/>The bricks, one after another, each laid so workmanlike in its place, and set with a knock<br/>    of<br/>  the<br/>  trowel-handle,<br/>The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the steady replenishing by<br/>    the<br/>  hod-men;<br/>‚ÄîSpar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown apprentices,<br/>The swing of their axes on the square-hew‚Äôd log, shaping it toward the shape of a mast,<br/>The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,<br/>The butter-color‚Äôd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,<br/>The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes;<br/>The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats, stays against the sea;<br/>‚ÄîThe city fireman‚Äîthe fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close-pack‚Äôd square,<br/>The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,<br/>The strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line, the rise and fall of<br/>    the<br/>  arms<br/>  forcing the water,<br/>The slender, spasmic, blue-white jets‚Äîthe bringing to bear of the hooks and ladders, and<br/>    their<br/>  execution,<br/>The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work, or through floors, if the fire smoulders<br/>    under<br/>  them,<br/><br/>The crowd with their lit faces, watching‚Äîthe glare and dense shadows;<br/>‚ÄîThe forger at his forge-furnace, and the user of iron after him,<br/>The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,<br/>The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel, and trying the edge with his thumb,<br/>The one who clean-shapes the handle, and sets it firmly in the socket;<br/>The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,<br/>The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,<br/>The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,<br/>The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,<br/>The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,<br/>The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,<br/>The death-howl, the limpsey tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe thither,<br/>The siege of revolted lieges determin‚Äôd for liberty,<br/>The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce and parley;<br/>The sack of an old city in its time,<br/>The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,<br/>Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,<br/>Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe of brigands,<br/>Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,<br/>The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,<br/>The list of all executive deeds and words, just or unjust,<br/>The power of personality, just or unjust.<br/><br/>4<br/>Muscle and pluck forever!<br/>What invigorates life, invigorates death,<br/>And the dead advance as much as the living advance,<br/>And the future is no more uncertain than the present,<br/>And the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the delicatesse of the earth<br/>    and<br/>  of<br/>  man,<br/>And nothing endures but personal qualities.<br/>What do you think endures?<br/>Do you think the great city endures?<br/>Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the best-built<br/>    steamships?<br/>Or hotels of granite and iron? or any chef-d‚Äôoeuvres of engineering, forts, armaments?<br/><br/>Away! These are not to be cherish‚Äôd for themselves;<br/>They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play for them;<br/>The show passes, all does well enough of course,<br/>All does very well till one flash of defiance.<br/><br/>The great city is that which has the greatest man or woman;<br/>If it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest city in the whole world.<br/><br/>5<br/>The place where the great city stands is not the place of stretch‚Äôd wharves, docks,<br/>  manufactures,<br/>  deposits of produce,<br/>Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new comers, or the anchor-lifters of the departing,<br/><br/>Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings, or shops selling goods from the rest<br/>    of<br/>  the<br/>  earth,<br/>Nor the place of the best libraries and schools‚Äînor the place where money is plentiest,<br/>Nor the place of the most numerous population.<br/><br/>Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards;<br/>Where the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return, and understands<br/>    them;<br/><br/>Where no monuments exist to heroes, but in the common words and deeds;<br/>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place;<br/>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws;<br/>Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases;<br/>Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of elected persons;<br/>Where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death pours its<br/>    sweeping<br/>  and<br/>  unript waves;<br/>Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside authority;<br/>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal‚Äîand President, Mayor, Governor, and what<br/>    not,<br/>  are<br/>  agents for pay;<br/>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves;<br/>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs;<br/>Where speculations on the Soul are encouraged;<br/>Where women walk in public processions in the streets, the same as the men,<br/>Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;<br/>Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands;<br/>Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands;<br/>Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands;<br/>Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,<br/>There the great city stands.<br/><br/>6<br/>How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!<br/>How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man‚Äôs or woman‚Äôs look!<br/><br/>All waits, or goes by default, till a strong being appears;<br/>A strong being is the proof of the race, and of the ability of the universe;<br/>When he or she appears, materials are overaw‚Äôd,<br/>The dispute on the Soul stops,<br/>The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn‚Äôd back, or laid away.<br/><br/>What is your money-making now? what can it do now?<br/>What is your respectability now?<br/>What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute-books, now?<br/>Where are your jibes of being now?<br/>Where are your cavils about the Soul now?<br/><br/>7<br/>A sterile landscape covers the ore‚Äîthere is as good as the best, for all the forbidding<br/>  appearance;<br/>There is the mine, there are the miners;<br/>The forge-furnace is there, the melt is accomplish‚Äôd; the hammers-men are at hand with<br/>    their<br/>  tongs<br/>  and hammers;<br/>What always served, and always serves, is at hand.<br/><br/>Than this, nothing has better served‚Äîit has served all:<br/>Served the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed Greek, and long ere the Greek:<br/>Served in building the buildings that last longer than any;<br/>Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindostanee;<br/>Served the mound-raiser on the Mississippi‚Äîserved those whose relics remain in Central<br/>  America;<br/>Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars, and the druids;<br/>Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snow-cover‚Äôd hills of<br/>    Scandinavia;<br/>Served those who, time out of mind, made on the granite walls rough sketches of the sun,<br/>    moon,<br/>  stars, ships, ocean-waves;<br/>Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths‚Äîserved the pastoral tribes and nomads;<br/>Served the long, long distant Kelt‚Äîserved the hardy pirates of the Baltic;<br/>Served before any of those, the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia;<br/>Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure, and the making of those for war;<br/>Served all great works on land, and all great works on the sea;<br/>For the medi√É¬¶val ages, and before the medi√É¬¶val ages;<br/>Served not the living only, then as now, but served the dead.<br/><br/>8<br/>I see the European headsman;<br/>He stands mask‚Äôd, clothed in red, with huge legs, and strong naked arms,<br/>And leans on a ponderous axe.<br/><br/>(Whom have you slaughter‚Äôd lately, European headsman?<br/>Whose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?)<br/><br/>I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs;<br/>I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,<br/>Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown‚Äôd ladies, impeach‚Äôd ministers, rejected kings,<br/>Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest.<br/><br/>I see those who in any land have died for the good cause;<br/>The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out;<br/>(Mind you, O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out.)<br/><br/>I see the blood wash‚Äôd entirely away from the axe;<br/>Both blade and helve are clean;<br/>They spirt no more the blood of European nobles‚Äîthey clasp no more the necks of queens.<br/><br/>I see the headsman withdraw and become useless;<br/>I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy‚ÄîI see no longer any axe upon it;<br/>I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race‚Äîthe newest, largest race.<br/><br/><br/>9<br/>(America! I do not vaunt my love for you;<br/>I have what I have.)<br/><br/>The axe leaps!<br/>The solid forest gives fluid utterances;<br/>They tumble forth, they rise and form,<br/>Hut, tent, landing, survey,<br/>Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade,<br/>Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, jamb, lath, panel, gable,<br/>Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibition-house, library,<br/>Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, shutter, turret, porch,<br/>Hoe, rake, pitch-fork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw, jack-plane, mallet, wedge, rounce,<br/>Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor,<br/>Work-box, chest, string‚Äôd instrument, boat, frame, and what not,<br/>Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of States,<br/>Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for orphans, or for the poor or sick,<br/>Manhattan steamboats and clippers, taking the measure of all seas.<br/><br/>The shapes arise!<br/>Shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users, and all that neighbors them,<br/>Cutters down of wood, and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Kennebec,<br/>Dwellers in cabins among the California mountains, or by the little lakes, or on the<br/>    Columbia,<br/><br/>Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande‚Äîfriendly gatherings, the characters<br/>    and<br/>  fun,<br/><br/>Dwellers up north in Minnesota and by the Yellowstone river‚Äîdwellers on coasts and off<br/>    coasts,<br/>Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice.<br/><br/>The shapes arise!<br/>Shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets;<br/>Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads;<br/>Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches;<br/>Shapes of the fleets of barges, towns, lake and canal craft, river craft.<br/><br/>The shapes arise!<br/>Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Eastern and Western Seas, and in many a bay and<br/>    by-place,<br/>The live-oak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the hackmatack-roots for knees,<br/>The ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the workmen busy outside and<br/>  inside,<br/>The tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze, bolt, line, square,<br/>    gouge,<br/>  and<br/>  bead-plane.<br/><br/>10<br/>The shapes arise!<br/>The shape measur‚Äôd, saw‚Äôd, jack‚Äôd, join‚Äôd, stain‚Äôd,<br/>The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud;<br/>The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of the bride‚Äôs bed;<br/>The shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers beneath, the shape of the babe‚Äôs<br/>  cradle;<br/><br/>The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for dancers‚Äô feet;<br/>The shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the friendly parents and children,<br/><br/>The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and woman‚Äîthe roof over the<br/>  well-married<br/>  young man and woman,<br/>The roof over the supper joyously cook‚Äôd by the chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the<br/>    chaste<br/>  husband, content after his day‚Äôs work.<br/><br/>The shapes arise!<br/>The shape of the prisoner‚Äôs place in the court-room, and of him or her seated in the<br/>    place;<br/>The shape of the liquor-bar lean‚Äôd against by the young rum-drinker and the old<br/>    rum-drinker;<br/>The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by sneaking footsteps;<br/>The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple;<br/>The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish winnings and losings;<br/>The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and sentenced murderer, the murderer with<br/>  haggard<br/>  face and pinion‚Äôd arms,<br/>The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white-lipp‚Äôd crowd, the dangling of<br/>    the<br/>  rope.<br/><br/>The shapes arise!<br/>Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances;<br/>The door passing the dissever‚Äôd friend, flush‚Äôd and in haste;<br/>The door that admits good news and bad news;<br/>The door whence the son left home, confident and puff‚Äôd up;<br/>The door he enter‚Äôd again from a long and scandalous absence, diseas‚Äôd, broken down,<br/>    without<br/>  innocence, without means.<br/><br/>11<br/>Her shape arises,<br/>She, less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever;<br/>The gross and soil‚Äôd she moves among do not make her gross and soil‚Äôd;<br/>She knows the thoughts as she passes‚Äînothing is conceal‚Äôd from her;<br/>She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor;<br/>She is the best belov‚Äôd‚Äîit is without exception‚Äîshe has no reason to fear, and she does<br/>    not<br/>  fear;<br/>Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp‚Äôd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as she passes;<br/>She is silent‚Äîshe is possess‚Äôd of herself‚Äîthey do not offend her;<br/>She receives them as the laws of nature receive them‚Äîshe is strong,<br/>She too is a law of nature‚Äîthere is no law stronger than she is.<br/><br/>12<br/>The main shapes arise!<br/>Shapes of Democracy, total‚Äîresult of centuries;<br/>Shapes, ever projecting other shapes;<br/>Shapes of turbulent manly cities;<br/>Shapes of the friends and home-givers of the whole earth,<br/>Shapes bracing the earth, and braced with the whole earth.
