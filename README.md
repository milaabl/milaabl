# üíÆ The Island by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>The morning watch was come; the vessel lay<br/>Her course, and gently made her liquid way;<br/>The cloven billow flashed from off her prow<br/>In furrows formed by that majestic plough;<br/>The waters with their world were all before;<br/>Behind, the South Sea's many an islet shore.<br/>The quiet night, now dappling, 'gan to wane,<br/>Dividing darkness from the dawning main;<br/>The dolphins, not unconscious of the day,<br/>Swam high, as eager of the coming ray;<br/>The stars from broader beams began to creep,<br/>And lift their shining eyelids from the deep;<br/>The sail resumed its lately shadowed white,<br/>And the wind fluttered with a freshening flight;<br/>The purpling Ocean owns the coming Sun,<br/>But ere he break--a deed is to be done.<br/><br/>The gallant Chief within his cabin slept,<br/>Secure in those by whom the watch was kept:<br/>His dreams were of Old England's welcome shore,<br/>Of toils rewarded, and of dangers o'er;<br/>His name was added to the glorious roll<br/>Of those who search the storm-surrounded Pole.<br/>The worst was over, and the rest seemed sure,<br/>And why should not his slumber be secure?<br/>Alas! his deck was trod by unwilling feet,<br/>And wilder hands would hold the vessel's sheet;<br/>Young hearts, which languished for some sunny isle,<br/>Where summer years and summer women smile;<br/>Men without country, who, too long estranged,<br/>Had found no native home, or found it changed,<br/>And, half uncivilised, preferred the cave<br/>Of some soft savage to the uncertain wave--<br/>The gushing fruits that nature gave unfilled;<br/>The wood without a path--but where they willed;<br/>The field o'er which promiscuous Plenty poured<br/>Her horn; the equal land without a lord;<br/>The wish--which ages have not yet subdued<br/>In man--to have no master save his mood;<br/>The earth, whose mine was on its face, unsold,<br/>The glowing sun and produce all its gold;<br/>The Freedom which can call each grot a home;<br/>The general garden, where all steps may roam,<br/>Where Nature owns a nation as her child,<br/>Exulting in the enjoyment of the wild;<br/>Their shells, their fruits, the only wealth they know,<br/>Their unexploring navy, the canoe;<br/>Their sport, the dashing breakers and the chase;<br/>Their strangest sight, an European face:--<br/>Such was the country which these strangers yearned<br/>To see again--a sight they dearly earned.<br/><br/>Awake, bold Bligh! the foe is at the gate!<br/>Awake! awake!----Alas! it is too late!<br/>Fiercely beside thy cot the mutineer<br/>Stands, and proclaims the reign of rage and fear.<br/>Thy limbs are bound, the bayonet at thy breast;<br/>The hands, which trembled at thy voice, arrest;<br/>Dragged o'er the deck, no more at thy command<br/>The obedient helm shall veer, the sail expand;<br/>That savage Spirit, which would lull by wrath<br/>Its desperate escape from Duty's path,<br/>Glares round thee, in the scarce believing eyes<br/>Of those who fear the Chief they sacrifice:<br/>For ne'er can Man his conscience all assuage,<br/>Unless he drain the wine of Passion--Rage.<br/><br/>In vain, not silenced by the eye of Death,<br/>Thou call'st the loyal with thy menaced breath:--<br/>They come not; they are few, and, overawed,<br/>Must acquiesce, while sterner hearts applaud.<br/>In vain thou dost demand the cause: a curse<br/>Is all the answer, with the threat of worse.<br/>Full in thine eyes is waved the glittering blade,<br/>Close to thy throat the pointed bayonet laid.<br/>The levelled muskets circle round thy breast<br/>In hands as steeled to do the deadly rest.<br/>Thou dar'st them to their worst, exclaiming--"Fire!"<br/>But they who pitied not could yet admire;<br/>Some lurking remnant of their former awe<br/>Restrained them longer than their broken law;<br/>They would not dip their souls at once in blood,<br/>But left thee to the mercies of the flood.<br/><br/>"Hoist out the boat!" was now the leader's cry;<br/>And who dare answer "No!" to Mutiny,<br/>In the first dawning of the drunken hour,<br/>The Saturnalia of unhoped-for power?<br/>The boat is lowered with all the haste of hate,<br/>With its slight plank between thee and thy fate;<br/>Her only cargo such a scant supply<br/>As promises the death their hands deny;<br/>And just enough of water and of bread<br/>To keep, some days, the dying from the dead:<br/>Some cordage, canvass, sails, and lines, and twine,<br/>But treasures all to hermits of the brine,<br/>Were added after, to the earnest prayer<br/>Of those who saw no hope, save sea and air;<br/>And last, that trembling vassal of the Pole--<br/>The feeling compass--Navigation's soul.<br/><br/>And now the self-elected Chief finds time<br/>To stun the first sensation of his crime,<br/>And raise it in his followers--"Ho! the bowl!"<br/>Lest passion should return to reason's shoal.<br/>"Brandy for heroes!" Burke could once exclaim--<br/>No doubt a liquid path to Epic fame;<br/>And such the new-born heroes found it here,<br/>And drained the draught with an applauding cheer.<br/>"Huzza! for Otaheite!" was the cry.<br/>How strange such shouts from sons of Mutiny!<br/>The gentle island, and the genial soil,<br/>The friendly hearts, the feasts without a toil,<br/>The courteous manners but from nature caught,<br/>The wealth unhoarded, and the love unbought;<br/>Could these have charms for rudest sea-boys, driven<br/>Before the mast by every wind of heaven?<br/>And now, even now prepared with others' woes<br/>To earn mild Virtue's vain desire, repose?<br/>Alas! such is our nature! all but aim<br/>At the same end by pathways not the same;<br/>Our means--our birth--our nation, and our name,<br/>Our fortune--temper--even our outward frame,<br/>Are far more potent o'er our yielding clay<br/>Than aught we know beyond our little day.<br/>Yet still there whispers the small voice within,<br/>Heard through Gain's silence, and o'er Glory's din:<br/>Whatever creed be taught, or land be trod,<br/>Man's conscience is the Oracle of God.<br/><br/>The launch is crowded with the faithful few<br/>Who wait their Chief, a melancholy crew:<br/>But some remained reluctant on the deck<br/>Of that proud vessel--now a moral wreck--<br/>And viewed their Captain's fate with piteous eyes;<br/>While others scoffed his augured miseries,<br/>Sneered at the prospect of his pigmy sail,<br/>And the slight bark so laden and so frail.<br/>The tender nautilus, who steers his prow,<br/>The sea-born sailor of his shell canoe,<br/>The ocean Mab, the fairy of the sea,<br/>Seems far less fragile, and, alas! more free.<br/>He, when the lightning-winged Tornados sweep<br/>The surge, is safe--his port is in the deep--<br/>And triumphs o'er the armadas of Mankind,<br/>Which shake the World, yet crumble in the wind.<br/><br/>When all was now prepared, the vessel clear<br/>Which hailed her master in the mutineer,<br/>A seaman, less obdurate than his mates,<br/>Showed the vain pity which but irritates;<br/>Watched his late Chieftain with exploring eye,<br/>And told, in signs, repentant sympathy;<br/>Held the moist shaddock to his parched mouth,<br/>Which felt Exhaustion's deep and bitter drouth.<br/>But soon observed, this guardian was withdrawn,<br/>Nor further Mercy clouds Rebellion's dawn.<br/>Then forward stepped the bold and froward boy<br/>His Chief had cherished only to destroy,<br/>And, pointing to the helpless prow beneath,<br/>Exclaimed, "Depart at once! delay is death!"<br/>Yet then, even then, his feelings ceased not all:<br/>In that last moment could a word recall<br/>Remorse for the black deed as yet half done,<br/>And what he hid from many showed to one:<br/>When Bligh in stern reproach demanded where<br/>Was now his grateful sense of former care?<br/>Where all his hopes to see his name aspire,<br/>And blazon Britain's thousand glories higher?<br/>His feverish lips thus broke their gloomy spell,<br/>"Tis that! 'tis that! I am in hell! in hell!"<br/>No more he said; but urging to the bark<br/>His Chief, commits him to his fragile ark;<br/>These the sole accents from his tongue that fell,<br/>But volumes lurked below his fierce farewell.<br/><br/>The arctic Sun rose broad above the wave;<br/>The breeze now sank, now whispered from his cave;<br/>As on the √Üolian harp, his fitful wings<br/>Now swelled, now fluttered o'er his Ocean strings.<br/>With slow, despairing oar, the abandoned skiff<br/>Ploughs its drear progress to the scarce seen cliff,<br/>Which lifts its peak a cloud above the main:<br/>_That_ boat and ship shall never meet again!<br/><br/>But 'tis not mine to tell their tale of grief,<br/>Their constant peril, and their scant relief;<br/>Their days of danger, and their nights of pain;<br/>Their manly courage even when deemed in vain;<br/>The sapping famine, rendering scarce a son<br/>Known to his mother in the skeleton;<br/>The ills that lessened still their little store,<br/>And starved even Hunger till he wrung no more;<br/>The varying frowns and favours of the deep,<br/>That now almost ingulfs, then leaves to creep<br/>With crazy oar and shattered strength along<br/>The tide that yields reluctant to the strong;<br/>The incessant fever of that arid thirst<br/>Which welcomes, as a well, the clouds that burst<br/>Above their naked bones, and feels delight<br/>In the cold drenching of the stormy night,<br/>And from the outspread canvass gladly wrings<br/>A drop to moisten Life's all-gasping springs;<br/>The savage foe escaped, to seek again<br/>More hospitable shelter from the main;<br/>The ghastly Spectres which were doomed at last<br/>To tell as true a tale of dangers past,<br/>As ever the dark annals of the deep<br/>Disclosed for man to dread or woman weep.<br/><br/>We leave them to their fate, but not unknown<br/>Nor unredressed. Revenge may have her own:<br/>Roused Discipline aloud proclaims their cause,<br/>And injured Navies urge their broken laws.<br/>Pursue we on his track the mutineer,<br/>Whom distant vengeance had not taught to fear.<br/>Wide o'er the wave--away! away! away!<br/>Once more his eyes shall hail the welcome bay;<br/>Once more the happy shores without a law<br/>Receive the outlaws whom they lately saw;<br/>Nature, and Nature's goddess--Woman--woos<br/>To lands where, save their conscience, none accuse;<br/>Where all partake the earth without dispute,<br/>And bread itself is gathered as a fruit;<br/>Where none contest the fields, the woods, the streams:--<br/>The goldless Age, where Gold disturbs no dreams,<br/>Inhabits or inhabited the shore,<br/>Till Europe taught them better than before;<br/>Bestowed her customs, and amended theirs,<br/>But left her vices also to their heirs.<br/>Away with this! behold them as they were,<br/>Do good with Nature, or with Nature err.<br/>"Huzza! for Otaheite!" was the cry,<br/>As stately swept the gallant vessel by.<br/>The breeze springs up; the lately flapping sail<br/>Extends its arch before the growing gale;<br/>In swifter ripples stream aside the seas,<br/>Which her bold bow flings off with dashing ease.<br/>Thus Argo ploughed the Euxine's virgin foam,<br/>But those she wafted still looked back to home;<br/>These spurn their country with their rebel bark,<br/>And fly her as the raven fled the Ark;<br/>And yet they seek to nestle with the dove,<br/>And tame their fiery spirits down to Love.<br/><br/>CANTO THE SECOND.<br/><br/>How pleasant were the songs of Toobonai,<br/>When Summer's Sun went down the coral bay!<br/>Come, let us to the islet's softest shade,<br/>And hear the warbling birds! the damsels said:<br/>The wood-dove from the forest depth shall coo,<br/>Like voices of the Gods from Bolotoo;<br/>We'll cull the flowers that grow above the dead,<br/>For these most bloom where rests the warrior's head;<br/>And we will sit in Twilight's face, and see<br/>The sweet Moon glancing through the Tooa tree,<br/>The lofty accents of whose sighing bough<br/>Shall sadly please us as we lean below;<br/>Or climb the steep, and view the surf in vain<br/>Wrestle with rocky giants o'er the main,<br/>Which spurn in columns back the baffled spray.<br/>How beautiful are these! how happy they,<br/>Who, from the toil and tumult of their lives,<br/>Steal to look down where nought but Ocean strives!<br/>Even He too loves at times the blue lagoon,<br/>And smooths his ruffled mane beneath the Moon.<br/><br/>Yes--from the sepulchre we'll gather flowers,<br/>Then feast like spirits in their promised bowers,<br/>Then plunge and revel in the rolling surf,<br/>Then lay our limbs along the tender turf,<br/>And, wet and shining from the sportive toil,<br/>Anoint our bodies with the fragrant oil,<br/>And plait our garlands gathered from the grave,<br/>And wear the wreaths that sprung from out the brave.<br/>But lo! night comes, the Mooa woos us back,<br/>The sound of mats are heard along our track;<br/>Anon the torchlight dance shall fling its sheen<br/>In flashing mazes o'er the Marly's green;<br/>And we too will be there; we too recall<br/>The memory bright with many a festival,<br/>Ere Fiji blew the shell of war, when foes<br/>For the first time were wafted in canoes.<br/>Alas! for them the flower of manhood bleeds;<br/>Alas! for them our fields are rank with weeds:<br/>Forgotten is the rapture, or unknown,<br/>Of wandering with the Moon and Love alone.<br/>But be it so:--_they_ taught us how to wield<br/>The club, and rain our arrows o'er the field:<br/>Now let them reap the harvest of their art!<br/>But feast to-night! to-morrow we depart.<br/>Strike up the dance! the Cava bowl fill high!<br/>Drain every drop!--to-morrow we may die.<br/>In summer garments be our limbs arrayed;<br/>Around our waists the Tappa's white displayed;<br/>Thick wreaths shall form our coronal, like Spring's,<br/>And round our necks shall glance the Hooni strings;<br/>So shall their brighter hues contrast the glow<br/>Of the dusk bosoms that beat high below.<br/><br/>But now the dance is o'er--yet stay awhile;<br/>Ah, pause! nor yet put out the social smile.<br/>To-morrow for the Mooa we depart,<br/>But not to-night--to-night is for the heart.<br/>Again bestow the wreaths we gently woo,<br/>Ye young Enchantresses of gay Licoo!<br/>How lovely are your forms! how every sense<br/>Bows to your beauties, softened, but intense,<br/>Like to the flowers on Mataloco's steep,<br/>Which fling their fragrance far athwart the deep!--<br/>We too will see Licoo; but--oh! my heart!--<br/>What do I say?--to-morrow we depart!<br/><br/>Thus rose a song--the harmony of times<br/>Before the winds blew Europe o'er these climes.<br/>True, they had vices--such are Nature's growth--<br/>But only the barbarian's--we have both;<br/>The sordor of civilisation, mixed<br/>With all the savage which Man's fall hath fixed.<br/>Who hath not seen Dissimulation's reign,<br/>The prayers of Abel linked to deeds of Cain?<br/>Who such would see may from his lattice view<br/>The Old World more degraded than the New,--<br/>Now _new_ no more, save where Columbia rears<br/>Twin giants, born by Freedom to her spheres,<br/>Where Chimborazo, over air,--earth,--wave,--<br/>Glares with his Titan eye, and sees no slave.<br/><br/>Such was this ditty of Tradition's days,<br/>Which to the dead a lingering fame conveys<br/>In song, where Fame as yet hath left no sign<br/>Beyond the sound whose charm is half divine;<br/>Which leaves no record to the sceptic eye,<br/>But yields young History all to Harmony;<br/>A boy Achilles, with the Centaur's lyre<br/>In hand, to teach him to surpass his sire.<br/>For one long-cherished ballad's simple stave,<br/>Rung from the rock, or mingled with the wave,<br/>Or from the bubbling streamlet's grassy side,<br/>Or gathering mountain echoes as they glide,<br/>Hath greater power o'er each true heart and ear,<br/>Than all the columns Conquest's minions rear;<br/>Invites, when Hieroglyphics are a theme<br/>For sages' labours, or the student's dream;<br/>Attracts, when History's volumes are a toil,--<br/>The first, the freshest bud of Feeling's soil.<br/>Such was this rude rhyme--rhyme is of the rude--<br/>But such inspired the Norseman's solitude,<br/>Who came and conquered; such, wherever rise<br/>Lands which no foes destroy or civilise,<br/>Exist: and what can our accomplished art<br/>Of verse do more than reach the awakened heart?<br/><br/>And sweetly now those untaught melodies<br/>Broke the luxurious silence of the skies,<br/>The sweet siesta of a summer day,<br/>The tropic afternoon of Toobonai,<br/>When every flower was bloom, and air was balm,<br/>And the first breath began to stir the palm,<br/>The first yet voiceless wind to urge the wave<br/>All gently to refresh the thirsty cave,<br/>Where sat the Songstress with the stranger boy,<br/>Who taught her Passion's desolating joy,<br/>Too powerful over every heart, but most<br/>O'er those who know not how it may be lost;<br/>O'er those who, burning in the new-born fire,<br/>Like martyrs revel in their funeral pyre,<br/>With such devotion to their ecstacy,<br/>That Life knows no such rapture as to die:<br/>And die they do; for earthly life has nought<br/>Matched with that burst of Nature, even in thought;<br/>And all our dreams of better life above<br/>But close in one eternal gush of Love.<br/><br/>There sat the gentle savage of the wild,<br/>In growth a woman, though in years a child,<br/>As childhood dates within our colder clime,<br/>Where nought is ripened rapidly save crime;<br/>The infant of an infant world, as pure<br/>From Nature--lovely, warm, and premature;<br/>Dusky like night, but night with all her stars;<br/>Or cavern sparkling with its native spars;<br/>With eyes that were a language and a spell,<br/>A form like Aphrodite's in her shell,<br/>With all her loves around her on the deep,<br/>Voluptuous as the first approach of sleep;<br/>Yet full of life--for through her tropic cheek<br/>The blush would make its way, and all but speak;<br/>The sun-born blood suffused her neck, and threw<br/>O'er her clear nut-brown skin a lucid hue,<br/>Like coral reddening through the darkened wave,<br/>Which draws the diver to the crimson cave.<br/>Such was this daughter of the southern seas,<br/>Herself a billow in her energies,<br/>To bear the bark of others' happiness,<br/>Nor feel a sorrow till their joy grew less:<br/>Her wild and warm yet faithful bosom knew<br/>No joy like what it gave; her hopes ne'er drew<br/>Aught from Experience, that chill touchstone, whose<br/>Sad proof reduces all things from their hues:<br/>She feared no ill, because she knew it not,<br/>Or what she knew was soon--too soon--forgot:<br/>Her smiles and tears had passed, as light winds pass<br/>O'er lakes to ruffle, not destroy, their glass,<br/>Whose depths unsearched, and fountains from the hill,<br/>Restore their surface, in itself so still,<br/>Until the Earthquake tear the Naiad's cave,<br/>Root up the spring, and trample on the wave,<br/>And crush the living waters to a mass,<br/>The amphibious desert of the dank morass!<br/>And must their fate be hers? The eternal change<br/>But grasps Humanity with quicker range;<br/>And they who fall but fall as worlds will fall,<br/>To rise, if just, a Spirit o'er them all.<br/><br/>And who is he? the blue-eyed northern child<br/>Of isles more known to man, but scarce less wild;<br/>The fair-haired offspring of the Hebrides,<br/>Where roars the Pentland with its whirling seas;<br/>Rocked in his cradle by the roaring wind,<br/>The tempest-born in body and in mind,<br/>His young eyes opening on the ocean-foam,<br/>Had from that moment deemed the deep his home,<br/>The giant comrade of his pensive moods,<br/>The sharer of his craggy solitudes,<br/>The only Mentor of his youth, where'er<br/>His bark was borne; the sport of wave and air;<br/>A careless thing, who placed his choice in chance,<br/>Nursed by the legends of his land's romance;<br/>Eager to hope, but not less firm to bear,<br/>Acquainted with all feelings save despair.<br/>Placed in the Arab's clime he would have been<br/>As bold a rover as the sands have seen,<br/>And braved their thirst with as enduring lip<br/>As Ishmael, wafted on his Desert-Ship;<br/>Fixed upon Chili's shore, a proud cacique:<br/>On Hellas' mountains, a rebellious Greek;<br/>Born in a tent, perhaps a Tamerlane;<br/>Bred to a throne, perhaps unfit to reign.<br/>For the same soul that rends its path to sway,<br/>If reared to such, can find no further prey<br/>Beyond itself, and must retrace its way,<br/>Plunging for pleasure into pain: the same<br/>Spirit which made a Nero, Rome's worst shame,<br/>A humbler state and discipline of heart,<br/>Had formed his glorious namesake's counterpart;<br/>But grant his vices, grant them all his own,<br/>How small their theatre without a throne!<br/><br/>Thou smilest:--these comparisons seem high<br/>To those who scan all things with dazzled eye;<br/>Linked with the unknown name of one whose doom<br/>Has nought to do with glory or with Rome,<br/>With Chili, Hellas, or with Araby;--<br/>Thou smilest?--Smile; 'tis better thus than sigh;<br/>Yet such he might have been; he was a man,<br/>A soaring spirit, ever in the van,<br/>A patriot hero or despotic chief,<br/>To form a nation's glory or its grief,<br/>Born under auspices which make us more<br/>Or less than we delight to ponder o'er.<br/>But these are visions; say, what was he here?<br/>A blooming boy, a truant mutineer.<br/>The fair-haired Torquil, free as Ocean's spray,<br/>The husband of the bride of Toobonai.<br/><br/>By Neuha's side he sate, and watched the waters,--<br/>Neuha, the sun-flower of the island daughters,<br/>Highborn, (a birth at which the herald smiles,<br/>Without a scutcheon for these secret isles,)<br/>Of a long race, the valiant and the free,<br/>The naked knights of savage chivalry,<br/>Whose grassy cairns ascend along the shore;<br/>And thine--I've seen--Achilles! do no more.<br/>She, when the thunder-bearing strangers came,<br/>In vast canoes, begirt with bolts of flame,<br/>Topped with tall trees, which, loftier than the palm,<br/>Seemed rooted in the deep amidst its calm:<br/>But when the winds awakened, shot forth wings<br/>Broad as the cloud along the horizon flings,<br/>And swayed the waves, like cities of the sea,<br/>Making the very billows look less free;--<br/>She, with her paddling oar and dancing prow,<br/>Shot through the surf, like reindeer through the snow,<br/>Swift-gliding o'er the breaker's whitening edge,<br/>Light as a Nereid in her ocean sledge,<br/>And gazed and wondered at the giant hulk,<br/>Which heaved from wave to wave its trampling bulk.<br/>The anchor dropped; it lay along the deep,<br/>Like a huge lion in the sun asleep,<br/>While round it swarmed the Proas' flitting chain,<br/>Like summer bees that hum around his mane.<br/><br/>The white man landed!--need the rest be told?<br/>The New World stretched its dusk hand to the Old;<br/>Each was to each a marvel, and the tie<br/>Of wonder warmed to better sympathy.<br/>Kind was the welcome of the sun-born sires,<br/>And kinder still their daughters' gentler fires.<br/>Their union grew: the children of the storm<br/>Found beauty linked with many a dusky form;<br/>While these in turn admired the paler glow,<br/>Which seemed so white in climes that knew no snow.<br/>The chace, the race, the liberty to roam,<br/>The soil where every cottage showed a home;<br/>The sea-spread net, the lightly launched canoe,<br/>Which stemmed the studded archipelago,<br/>O'er whose blue bosom rose the starry isles;<br/>The healthy slumber, earned by sportive toils;<br/>The palm, the loftiest Dryad of the woods,<br/>Within whose bosom infant Bacchus broods,<br/>While eagles scarce build higher than the crest<br/>Which shadows o'er the vineyard in her breast;<br/>The Cava feast, the Yam, the Cocoa's root,<br/>Which bears at once the cup, and milk, and fruit;<br/>The Bread-tree, which, without the ploughshare, yields<br/>The unreaped harvest of unfurrowed fields,<br/>And bakes its unadulterated loaves<br/>Without a furnace in unpurchased groves,<br/>And flings off famine from its fertile breast,<br/>A priceless market for the gathering guest;--<br/>These, with the luxuries of seas and woods,<br/>The airy joys of social solitudes,<br/>Tamed each rude wanderer to the sympathies<br/>Of those who were more happy, if less wise,<br/>Did more than Europe's discipline had done,<br/>And civilised Civilisation's son!<br/><br/>Of these, and there was many a willing pair,<br/>Neuha and Torquil were not the least fair:<br/>Both children of the isles, though distant far;<br/>Both born beneath a sea-presiding star;<br/>Both nourished amidst Nature's native scenes,<br/>Loved to the last, whatever intervenes<br/>Between us and our Childhood's sympathy,<br/>Which still reverts to what first caught the eye.<br/>He who first met the Highlands' swelling blue<br/>Will love each peak that shows a kindred hue,<br/>Hail in each crag a friend's familiar face,<br/>And clasp the mountain in his Mind's embrace.<br/>Long have I roamed through lands which are not mine,<br/>Adored the Alp, and loved the Apennine,<br/>Revered Parnassus, and beheld the steep<br/>Jove's Ida and Olympus crown the deep:<br/>But 'twas not all long ages' lore, nor all<br/>_Their_ nature held me in their thrilling thrall;<br/>The infant rapture still survived the boy,<br/>And Loch-na-gar with Ida looked o'er Troy,<br/>Mixed Celtic memories with the Phrygian mount,<br/>And Highland linns with Castalie's clear fount.<br/>Forgive me, Homer's universal shade!<br/>Forgive me, Ph≈ìbus! that my fancy strayed;<br/>The North and Nature taught me to adore<br/>Your scenes sublime, from those beloved before.<br/><br/>The love which maketh all things fond and fair,<br/>The youth which makes one rainbow of the air,<br/>The dangers past, that make even Man enjoy<br/>The pause in which he ceases to destroy,<br/>The mutual beauty, which the sternest feel<br/>Strike to their hearts like lightning to the steel,<br/>United the half savage and the whole,<br/>The maid and boy, in one absorbing soul.<br/>No more the thundering memory of the fight<br/>Wrapped his weaned bosom in its dark delight;<br/>No more the irksome restlessness of Rest<br/>Disturbed him like the eagle in her nest,<br/>Whose whetted beak and far-pervading eye<br/>Darts for a victim over all the sky:<br/>His heart was tamed to that voluptuous state,<br/>At once Elysian and effeminate,<br/>Which leaves no laurels o'er the Hero's urn;--<br/>These wither when for aught save blood they burn;<br/>Yet when their ashes in their nook are laid,<br/>Doth not the myrtle leave as sweet a shade?<br/>Had C√¶sar known but Cleopatra's kiss,<br/>Rome had been free, the world had not been his.<br/>And what have C√¶sar's deeds and C√¶sar's fame<br/>Done for the earth? We feel them in our shame.<br/>The gory sanction of his Glory stains<br/>The rust which tyrants cherish on our chains.<br/>Though Glory--Nature--Reason--Freedom, bid<br/>Roused millions do what single Brutus did--<br/>Sweep these mere mock-birds of the Despot's song<br/>From the tall bough where they have perched so long,--<br/>Still are we hawked at by such mousing owls,<br/>And take for falcons those ignoble fowls,<br/>When but a word of freedom would dispel<br/>These bugbears, as their terrors show too well.<br/><br/>Rapt in the fond forgetfulness of life,<br/>Neuha, the South Sea girl, was all a wife,<br/>With no distracting world to call her off<br/>From Love; with no Society to scoff<br/>At the new transient flame; no babbling crowd<br/>Of coxcombry in admiration loud,<br/>Or with adulterous whisper to alloy<br/>Her duty, and her glory, and her joy:<br/>With faith and feelings naked as her form,<br/>She stood as stands a rainbow in a storm,<br/>Changing its hues with bright variety,<br/>But still expanding lovelier o'er the sky,<br/>Howe'er its arch may swell, its colours move,<br/>The cloud-compelling harbinger of Love.<br/><br/>Here, in this grotto of the wave-worn shore,<br/>They passed the Tropic's red meridian o'er;<br/>Nor long the hours--they never paused o'er time,<br/>Unbroken by the clock's funereal chime,<br/>Which deals the daily pittance of our span,<br/>And points and mocks with iron laugh at man.<br/>What deemed they of the future or the past?<br/>The present, like a tyrant, held them fast:<br/>Their hour-glass was the sea-sand, and the tide,<br/>Like her smooth billow, saw their moments glide<br/>Their clock the Sun, in his unbounded tower<br/>They reckoned not, whose day was but an hour;<br/>The nightingale, their only vesper-bell,<br/>Sung sweetly to the rose the day's farewell;<br/>The broad Sun set, but not with lingering sweep,<br/>As in the North he mellows o'er the deep;<br/>But fiery, full, and fierce, as if he left<br/>The World for ever, earth of light bereft,<br/>Plunged with red forehead down along the wave,<br/>As dives a hero headlong to his grave.<br/>Then rose they, looking first along the skies,<br/>And then for light into each other's eyes,<br/>Wondering that Summer showed so brief a sun,<br/>And asking if indeed the day were done.<br/><br/>And let not this seem strange: the devotee<br/>Lives not in earth, but in his ecstasy;<br/>Around him days and worlds are heedless driven,<br/>His Soul is gone before his dust to Heaven.<br/>Is Love less potent? No--his path is trod,<br/>Alike uplifted gloriously to God;<br/>Or linked to all we know of Heaven below,<br/>The other better self, whose joy or woe<br/>Is more than ours; the all-absorbing flame<br/>Which, kindled by another, grows the same,<br/>Wrapt in one blaze; the pure, yet funeral pile,<br/>Where gentle hearts, like Bramins, sit and smile.<br/>How often we forget all time, when lone,<br/>Admiring Nature's universal throne,<br/>Her woods--her wilds--her waters--the intense<br/>Reply of _hers_ to our intelligence!<br/>Live not the Stars and Mountains? Are the Waves<br/>Without a spirit? Are the dropping caves<br/>Without a feeling in their silent tears?<br/>No, no;--they woo and clasp us to their spheres,<br/>Dissolve this clog and clod of clay before<br/>Its hour, and merge our soul in the great shore.<br/>Strip off this fond and false identity!--<br/>Who thinks of self when gazing on the sky?<br/>And who, though gazing lower, ever thought,<br/>In the young moments ere the heart is taught<br/>Time's lesson, of Man's baseness or his own?<br/>All Nature is his realm, and Love his throne.<br/><br/>Neuha arose, and Torquil: Twilight's hour<br/>Came sad and softly to their rocky bower,<br/>Which, kindling by degrees its dewy spars,<br/>Echoed their dim light to the mustering stars.<br/>Slowly the pair, partaking Nature's calm,<br/>Sought out their cottage, built beneath the palm;<br/>Now smiling and now silent, as the scene;<br/>Lovely as Love--the Spirit!--when serene.<br/>The Ocean scarce spoke louder with his swell,<br/>Than breathes his mimic murmurer in the shell,<br/>As, far divided from his parent deep,<br/>The sea-born infant cries, and will not sleep,<br/>Raising his little plaint in vain, to rave<br/>For the broad bosom of his nursing wave:<br/>The woods drooped darkly, as inclined to rest,<br/>The tropic bird wheeled rockward to his nest,<br/>And the blue sky spread round them like a lake<br/>Of peace, where Piety her thirst might slake.<br/><br/>But through the palm and plantain, hark, a Voice!<br/>Not such as would have been a lover's choice,<br/>In such an hour, to break the air so still;<br/>No dying night-breeze, harping o'er the hill,<br/>Striking the strings of nature, rock and tree,<br/>Those best and earliest lyres of Harmony,<br/>With Echo for their chorus; nor the alarm<br/>Of the loud war-whoop to dispel the charm;<br/>Nor the soliloquy of the hermit owl,<br/>Exhaling all his solitary soul,<br/>The dim though large-eyed wing√©d anchorite,<br/>Who peals his dreary P√¶an o'er the night;<br/>But a loud, long, and naval whistle, shrill<br/>As ever started through a sea-bird's bill;<br/>And then a pause, and then a hoarse "Hillo!<br/>Torquil, my boy! what cheer? Ho! brother, ho!"<br/>"Who hails?" cried Torquil, following with his eye<br/>The sound. "Here's one," was all the brief reply.<br/><br/>But here the herald of the self-same mouth<br/>Came breathing o'er the aromatic south,<br/>Not like a "bed of violets" on the gale,<br/>But such as wafts its cloud o'er grog or ale,<br/>Borne from a short frail pipe, which yet had blown<br/>Its gentle odours over either zone,<br/>And, puffed where'er winds rise or waters roll,<br/>Had wafted smoke from Portsmouth to the Pole,<br/>Opposed its vapour as the lightning flashed,<br/>And reeked, 'midst mountain-billows, unabashed,<br/>To √Üolus a constant sacrifice,<br/>Through every change of all the varying skies.<br/>And what was he who bore it?--I may err,<br/>But deem him sailor or philosopher.<br/>Sublime Tobacco! which from East to West<br/>Cheers the tar's labour or the Turkman's rest;<br/>Which on the Moslem's ottoman divides<br/>His hours, and rivals opium and his brides;<br/>Magnificent in Stamboul, but less grand,<br/>Though not less loved, in Wapping or the Strand;<br/>Divine in hookas, glorious in a pipe,<br/>When tipped with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe:<br/>Like other charmers, wooing the caress,<br/>More dazzlingly when daring in full dress;<br/>Yet thy true lovers more admire by far<br/>Thy naked beauties--Give me a cigar!<br/><br/>Through the approaching darkness of the wood<br/>A human figure broke the solitude,<br/>Fantastically, it may be, arrayed,<br/>A seaman in a savage masquerade;<br/>Such as appears to rise out from the deep,<br/>When o'er the line the merry vessels sweep,<br/>And the rough Saturnalia of the tar<br/>Flock o'er the deck, in Neptune's borrowed car;<br/>And, pleased, the God of Ocean sees his name<br/>Revive once more, though but in mimic game<br/>Of his true sons, who riot in the breeze<br/>Undreamt of in his native Cyclades.<br/>Still the old God delights, from out the main,<br/>To snatch some glimpses of his ancient reign.<br/>Our sailor's jacket, though in ragged trim,<br/>His constant pipe, which never yet burned dim,<br/>His foremast air, and somewhat rolling gait,<br/>Like his dear vessel, spoke his former state;<br/>But then a sort of kerchief round his head,<br/>Not over tightly bound, nor nicely spread;<br/>And, 'stead of trowsers (ah! too early torn!<br/>For even the mildest woods will have their thorn)<br/>A curious sort of somewhat scanty mat<br/>Now served for inexpressibles and hat;<br/>His naked feet and neck, and sunburnt face,<br/>Perchance might suit alike with either race.<br/>His arms were all his own, our Europe's growth,<br/>Which two worlds bless for civilising both;<br/>The musket swung behind his shoulders broad,<br/>And somewhat stooped by his marine abode,<br/>But brawny as the boar's; and hung beneath,<br/>His cutlass drooped, unconscious of a sheath,<br/>Or lost or worn away; his pistols were<br/>Linked to his belt, a matrimonial pair--<br/>(Let not this metaphor appear a scoff,<br/>Though one missed fire, the other would go off);<br/>These, with a bayonet, not so free from rust<br/>As when the arm-chest held its brighter trust,<br/>Completed his accoutrements, as Night<br/>Surveyed him in his garb heteroclite.<br/><br/>"What cheer, Ben Bunting?" cried (when in full view<br/>Our new acquaintance) Torquil. "Aught of new?"<br/>"Ey, ey!" quoth Ben, "not new, but news enow;<br/>A strange sail in the offing."--"Sail! and how?<br/>What! could you make her out? It cannot be;<br/>I've seen no rag of canvass on the sea."<br/>"Belike," said Ben, "you might not from the bay,<br/>But from the bluff-head, where I watched to-day,<br/>I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind<br/>Was light and baffling."--"When the Sun declined<br/>Where lay she? had she anchored?"--"No, but still<br/>She bore down on us, till the wind grew still."<br/>"Her flag?"--"I had no glass: but fore and aft,<br/>Egad! she seemed a wicked-looking craft."<br/>"Armed?"--"I expect so;--sent on the look-out:<br/>'Tis time, belike, to put our helm about."<br/>"About?--Whate'er may have us now in chase,<br/>We'll make no running fight, for that were base;<br/>We will die at our quarters, like true men."<br/>"Ey, ey! for that 'tis all the same to Ben."<br/>"Does Christian know this?"--"Aye; he has piped all hands<br/>To quarters. They are furbishing the stands<br/>Of arms; and we have got some guns to bear,<br/>And scaled them. You are wanted."--"That's but fair;<br/>And if it were not, mine is not the soul<br/>To leave my comrades helpless on the shoal.<br/>My Neuha! ah! and must my fate pursue<br/>Not me alone, but one so sweet and true?<br/>But whatsoe'er betide, ah, Neuha! now<br/>Unman me not: the hour will not allow<br/>A tear; I am thine whatever intervenes!"<br/>"Right," quoth Ben; "that will do for the marines."<br/><br/>CANTO THE THIRD.<br/><br/>The fight was o'er; the flashing through the gloom,<br/>Which robes the cannon as he wings a tomb,<br/>Had ceased; and sulphury vapours upward driven<br/>Had left the Earth, and but polluted Heaven:<br/>The rattling roar which rung in every volley<br/>Had left the echoes to their melancholy;<br/>No more they shrieked their horror, boom for boom;<br/>The strife was done, the vanquished had their doom;<br/>The mutineers were crushed, dispersed, or ta'en,<br/>Or lived to deem the happiest were the slain.<br/>Few, few escaped, and these were hunted o'er<br/>The isle they loved beyond their native shore.<br/>No further home was theirs, it seemed, on earth,<br/>Once renegades to that which gave them birth;<br/>Tracked like wild beasts, like them they sought the wild,<br/>As to a Mother's bosom flies the child;<br/>But vainly wolves and lions seek their den,<br/>And still more vainly men escape from men.<br/><br/>Beneath a rock whose jutting base protrudes<br/>Far over Ocean in its fiercest moods,<br/>When scaling his enormous crag the wave<br/>Is hurled down headlong, like the foremost brave,<br/>And falls back on the foaming crowd behind,<br/>Which fight beneath the banners of the wind,<br/>But now at rest, a little remnant drew<br/>Together, bleeding, thirsty, faint, and few;<br/>But still their weapons in their hands, and still<br/>With something of the pride of former will,<br/>As men not all unused to meditate,<br/>And strive much more than wonder at their fate.<br/>Their present lot was what they had foreseen,<br/>And dared as what was likely to have been;<br/>Yet still the lingering hope, which deemed their lot<br/>Not pardoned, but unsought for or forgot,<br/>Or trusted that, if sought, their distant caves<br/>Might still be missed amidst the world of waves,<br/>Had weaned their thoughts in part from what they saw<br/>And felt, the vengeance of their country's law.<br/>Their sea-green isle, their guilt-won Paradise,<br/>No more could shield their Virtue or their Vice:<br/>Their better feelings, if such were, were thrown<br/>Back on themselves,--their sins remained alone.<br/>Proscribed even in their second country, they<br/>Were lost; in vain the World before them lay;<br/>All outlets seemed secured. Their new allies<br/>Had fought and bled in mutual sacrifice;<br/>But what availed the club and spear, and arm<br/>Of Hercules, against the sulphury charm,<br/>The magic of the thunder, which destroyed<br/>The warrior ere his strength could be employed?<br/>Dug, like a spreading pestilence, the grave<br/>No less of human bravery than the brave!<br/>Their own scant numbers acted all the few<br/>Against the many oft will dare and do;<br/>But though the choice seems native to die free,<br/>Even Greece can boast but one Thermopyl√¶,<br/>Till _now_, when she has forged her broken chain<br/>Back to a sword, and dies and lives again!<br/><br/>Beside the jutting rock the few appeared,<br/>Like the last remnant of the red-deer's herd;<br/>Their eyes were feverish, and their aspect worn,<br/>But still the hunter's blood was on their horn.<br/>A little stream came tumbling from the height,<br/>And straggling into ocean as it might,<br/>Its bounding crystal frolicked in the ray,<br/>And gushed from cliff to crag with saltless spray;<br/>Close on the wild, wide ocean, yet as pure<br/>And fresh as Innocence, and more secure,<br/>Its silver torrent glittered o'er the deep,<br/>As the shy chamois' eye o'erlooks the steep,<br/>While far below the vast and sullen swell<br/>Of Ocean's alpine azure rose and fell.<br/>To this young spring they rushed,--all feelings first<br/>Absorbed in Passion's and in Nature's thirst,--<br/>Drank as they do who drink their last, and threw<br/>Their arms aside to revel in its dew;<br/>Cooled their scorched throats, and washed the gory stains<br/>From wounds whose only bandage might be chains;<br/>Then, when their drought was quenched, looked sadly round,<br/>As wondering how so many still were found<br/>Alive and fetterless:--but silent all,<br/>Each sought his fellow's eyes, as if to call<br/>On him for language which his lips denied,<br/>As though their voices with their cause had died.<br/><br/>Stern, and aloof a little from the rest,<br/>Stood Christian, with his arms across his chest.<br/>The ruddy, reckless, dauntless hue once spread<br/>Along his cheek was livid now as lead;<br/>His light-brown locks, so graceful in their flow,<br/>Now rose like startled vipers o'er his brow.<br/>Still as a statue, with his lips comprest<br/>To stifle even the breath within his breast,<br/>Fast by the rock, all menacing, but mute,<br/>He stood; and, save a slight beat of his foot,<br/>Which deepened now and then the sandy dint<br/>Beneath his heel, his form seemed turned to flint.<br/>Some paces further Torquil leaned his head<br/>Against a bank, and spoke not, but he bled,--<br/>Not mortally:--his worst wound was within;<br/>His brow was pale, his blue eyes sunken in,<br/>And blood-drops, sprinkled o'er his yellow hair,<br/>Showed that his faintness came not from despair,<br/>But Nature's ebb. Beside him was another,<br/>Rough as a bear, but willing as a brother,--<br/>Ben Bunting, who essayed to wash, and wipe,<br/>And bind his wound--then calmly lit his pipe,<br/>A trophy which survived a hundred fights,<br/>A beacon which had cheered ten thousand nights.<br/>The fourth and last of this deserted group<br/>Walked up and down--at times would stand, then stoop<br/>To pick a pebble up--then let it drop--<br/>Then hurry as in haste--then quickly stop--<br/>Then cast his eyes on his companions--then<br/>Half whistle half a tune, and pause again--<br/>And then his former movements would redouble,<br/>With something between carelessness and trouble.<br/>This is a long description, but applies<br/>To scarce five minutes passed before the eyes;<br/>But yet _what_ minutes! Moments like to these<br/>Rend men's lives into immortalities.<br/><br/>At length Jack Skyscrape, a mercurial man,<br/>Who fluttered over all things like a fan,<br/>More brave than firm, and more disposed to dare<br/>And die at once than wrestle with despair,<br/>Exclaimed, "G--d damn!"--those syllables intense,--<br/>Nucleus of England's native eloquence,<br/>As the Turk's "Allah!" or the Roman's more<br/>Pagan "Proh Jupiter!" was wont of yore<br/>To give their first impressions such a vent,<br/>By way of echo to embarrassment.<br/>Jack was embarrassed,--never hero more,<br/>And as he knew not what to say, he swore:<br/>Nor swore in vain; the long congenial sound<br/>Revived Ben Bunting from his pipe profound;<br/>He drew it from his mouth, and looked full wise,<br/>But merely added to the oath his _eyes_;<br/>Thus rendering the imperfect phrase complete,<br/>A peroration I need not repeat.<br/><br/>But Christian, of a higher order, stood<br/>Like an extinct volcano in his mood;<br/>Silent, and sad, and savage,--with the trace<br/>Of passion reeking from his clouded face;<br/>Till lifting up again his sombre eye,<br/>It glanced on Torquil, who leaned faintly by.<br/>"And is it thus?" he cried, "unhappy boy!<br/>And thee, too, _thee_--my madness must destroy!"<br/>He said, and strode to where young Torquil stood,<br/>Yet dabbled with his lately flowing blood;<br/>Seized his hand wistfully, but did not press,<br/>And shrunk as fearful of his own caress;<br/>Enquired into his state: and when he heard<br/>The wound was slighter than he deemed or feared,<br/>A moment's brightness passed along his brow,<br/>As much as such a moment would allow.<br/>"Yes," he exclaimed, "we are taken in the toil,<br/>But not a coward or a common spoil;<br/>Dearly they have bought us--dearly still may buy,--<br/>And I must fall; but have _you_ strength to fly?<br/>'Twould be some comfort still, could you survive;<br/>Our dwindled band is now too few to strive.<br/>Oh! for a sole canoe! though but a shell,<br/>To bear you hence to where a hope may dwell!<br/>For me, my lot is what I sought; to be,<br/>In life or death, the fearless and the free."<br/><br/>Even as he spoke, around the promontory,<br/>Which nodded o'er the billows high and hoary,<br/>A dark speck dotted Ocean: on it flew<br/>Like to the shadow of a roused sea-mew;<br/>Onward it came--and, lo! a second followed--<br/>Now seen--now hid--where Ocean's vale was hollowed;<br/>And near, and nearer, till the dusky crew<br/>Presented well-known aspects to the view,<br/>Till on the surf their skimming paddles play,<br/>Buoyant as wings, and flitting through the spray;--<br/>Now perching on the wave's high curl, and now<br/>Dashed downward in the thundering foam below,<br/>Which flings it broad and boiling sheet on sheet,<br/>And slings its high flakes, shivered into sleet:<br/>But floating still through surf and swell, drew nigh<br/>The barks, like small birds through a lowering sky.<br/>Their art seemed nature--such the skill to sweep<br/>The wave of these born playmates of the deep.<br/><br/>And who the first that, springing on the strand,<br/>Leaped like a Nereid from her shell to land,<br/>With dark but brilliant skin, and dewy eye<br/>Shining with love, and hope, and constancy?<br/>Neuha--the fond, the faithful, the adored--<br/>Her heart on Torquil's like a torrent poured;<br/>And smiled, and wept, and near, and nearer clasped,<br/>As if to be assured 'twas _him_ she grasped;<br/>Shuddered to see his yet warm wound, and then,<br/>To find it trivial, smiled and wept again.<br/>She was a warrior's daughter, and could bear<br/>Such sights, and feel, and mourn, but not despair.<br/>Her lover lived,--nor foes nor fears could blight<br/>That full-blown moment in its all delight:<br/>Joy trickled in her tears, joy filled the sob<br/>That rocked her heart till almost heard to throb;<br/>And Paradise was breathing in the sigh<br/>Of Nature's child in Nature's ecstasy.<br/><br/>The sterner spirits who beheld that meeting<br/>Were not unmoved; who are, when hearts are greeting?<br/>Even Christian gazed upon the maid and boy<br/>With tearless eye, but yet a gloomy joy<br/>Mixed with those bitter thoughts the soul arrays<br/>In hopeless visions of our better days,<br/>When all's gone--to the rainbow's latest ray.<br/>"And but for me!" he said, and turned away;<br/>Then gazed upon the pair, as in his den<br/>A lion looks upon his cubs again;<br/>And then relapsed into his sullen guise,<br/>As heedless of his further destinies.<br/><br/>But brief their time for good or evil thought;<br/>The billows round the promontory brought<br/>The plash of hostile oars.--Alas! who made<br/>That sound a dread? All around them seemed arrayed<br/>Against them, save the bride of Toobonai:<br/>She, as she caught the first glimpse o'er the bay<br/>Of the armed boats, which hurried to complete<br/>The remnant's ruin with their flying feet,<br/>Beckoned the natives round her to their prows,<br/>Embarked their guests and launched their light canoes;<br/>In one placed Christian and his comrades twain--<br/>But she and Torquil must not part again.<br/>She fixed him in her own.--Away! away!<br/>They cleared the breakers, dart along the bay,<br/>And towards a group of islets, such as bear<br/>The sea-bird's nest and seal's surf-hollowed lair,<br/>They skim the blue tops of the billows; fast<br/>They flew, and fast their fierce pursuers chased.<br/>They gain upon them--now they lose again,--<br/>Again make way and menace o'er the main;<br/>And now the two canoes in chase divide,<br/>And follow different courses o'er the tide,<br/>To baffle the pursuit.--Away! away!<br/>As Life is on each paddle's flight to-day,<br/>And more than Life or lives to Neuha: Love<br/>Freights the frail bark and urges to the cove;<br/>And now the refuge and the foe are nigh--<br/>Yet, yet a moment! Fly, thou light ark, fly!<br/><br/>CANTO THE FOURTH.<br/><br/>White as a white sail on a dusky sea,<br/>When half the horizon's clouded and half free,<br/>Fluttering between the dun wave and the sky,<br/>Is Hope's last gleam in Man's extremity.<br/>Her anchor parts; but still her snowy sail<br/>Attracts our eye amidst the rudest gale:<br/>Though every wave she climbs divides us more,<br/>The heart still follows from the loneliest shore.<br/><br/>Not distant from the isle of Toobonai,<br/>A black rock rears its bosom o'er the spray,<br/>The haunt of birds, a desert to mankind,<br/>Where the rough seal reposes from the wind,<br/>And sleeps unwieldy in his cavern dun,<br/>Or gambols with huge frolic in the sun:<br/>There shrilly to the passing oar is heard<br/>The startled echo of the Ocean bird,<br/>Who rears on its bare breast her callow brood,<br/>The feathered fishers of the solitude.<br/>A narrow segment of the yellow sand<br/>On one side forms the outline of a strand;<br/>Here the young turtle, crawling from his shell,<br/>Steals to the deep wherein his parents dwell;<br/>Chipped by the beam, a nursling of the day,<br/>But hatched for ocean by the fostering ray;<br/>The rest was one bleak precipice, as e'er<br/>Gave mariners a shelter and despair;<br/>A spot to make the saved regret the deck<br/>Which late went down, and envy the lost wreck.<br/>Such was the stern asylum Neuha chose<br/>To shield her lover from his following foes;<br/>But all its secret was not told; she knew<br/>In this a treasure hidden from the view.<br/><br/>Ere the canoes divided, near the spot,<br/>The men that manned what held her Torquil's lot,<br/>By her command removed, to strengthen more<br/>The skiff which wafted Christian from the shore.<br/>This he would have opposed; but with a smile<br/>She pointed calmly to the craggy isle,<br/>And bade him "speed and prosper." _She_ would take<br/>The rest upon herself for Torquil's sake.<br/>They parted with this added aid; afar,<br/>The Proa darted like a shooting star,<br/>And gained on the pursuers, who now steered<br/>Right on the rock which she and Torquil neared.<br/>They pulled; her arm, though delicate, was free<br/>And firm as ever grappled with the sea,<br/>And yielded scarce to Torquil's manlier strength.<br/>The prow now almost lay within its length<br/>Of the crag's steep inexorable face,<br/>With nought but soundless waters for its base;<br/>Within a hundred boats' length was the foe,<br/>And now what refuge but their frail canoe?<br/>This Torquil asked with half upbraiding eye,<br/>Which said--"Has Neuha brought me here to die?<br/>Is this a place of safety, or a grave,<br/>And yon huge rock the tombstone of the wave?"<br/><br/>They rested on their paddles, and uprose<br/>Neuha, and pointing to the approaching foes,<br/>Cried, "Torquil, follow me, and fearless follow!"<br/>Then plunged at once into the Ocean's hollow.<br/>There was no time to pause--the foes were near--<br/>Chains in his eye, and menace in his ear;<br/>With vigour they pulled on, and as they came,<br/>Hailed him to yield, and by his forfeit name.<br/>Headlong he leapt--to him the swimmer's skill<br/>Was native, and now all his hope from ill:<br/>But how, or where? He dived, and rose no more;<br/>The boat's crew looked amazed o'er sea and shore.<br/>There was no landing on that precipice,<br/>Steep, harsh, and slippery as a berg of ice.<br/>They watched awhile to see him float again,<br/>But not a trace rebubbled from the main:<br/>The wave rolled on, no ripple on its face,<br/>Since their first plunge recalled a single trace;<br/>The little whirl which eddied, and slight foam,<br/>That whitened o'er what seemed their latest home,<br/>White as a sepulchre above the pair<br/>Who left no marble (mournful as an heir)<br/>The quiet Proa wavering o'er the tide<br/>Was all that told of Torquil and his bride;<br/>And but for this alone the whole might seem<br/>The vanished phantom of a seaman's dream.<br/>They paused and searched in vain, then pulled away;<br/>Even Superstition now forbade their stay.<br/>Some said he had not plunged into the wave,<br/>But vanished like a corpse-light from a grave;<br/>Others, that something supernatural<br/>Glared in his figure, more than mortal tall;<br/>While all agreed that in his cheek and eye<br/>There was a dead hue of Eternity.<br/>Still as their oars receded from the crag,<br/>Round every weed a moment would they lag,<br/>Expectant of some token of their prey;<br/>But no--he had melted from them like the spray.<br/><br/>And where was he the Pilgrim of the Deep,<br/>Following the Nereid? Had they ceased to weep<br/>For ever? or, received in coral caves,<br/>Wrung life and pity from the softening waves?<br/>Did they with Ocean's hidden sovereigns dwell,<br/>And sound with Mermen the fantastic shell?<br/>Did Neuha with the mermaids comb her hair<br/>Flowing o'er ocean as it streamed in air?<br/>Or had they perished, and in silence slept<br/>Beneath the gulf wherein they boldly leapt?<br/><br/>Young Neuha plunged into the deep, and he<br/>Followed: her track beneath her native sea<br/>Was as a native's of the element,<br/>So smoothly--bravely--brilliantly she went,<br/>Leaving a streak of light behind her heel,<br/>Which struck and flashed like an amphibious steel,<br/>Closely, and scarcely less expert to trace<br/>The depths where divers hold the pearl in chase,<br/>Torquil, the nursling of the northern seas,<br/>Pursued her liquid steps with heart and ease.<br/>Deep--deeper for an instant Neuha led<br/>The way--then upward soared--and as she spread<br/>Her arms, and flung the foam from off her locks,<br/>Laughed, and the sound was answered by the rocks.<br/>They had gained a central realm of earth again,<br/>But looked for tree, and field, and sky, in vain.<br/>Around she pointed to a spacious cave,<br/>Whose only portal was the keyless wave,<br/>(A hollow archway by the sun unseen,<br/>Save through the billows' glassy veil of green,<br/>In some transparent ocean holiday,<br/>When all the finny people are at play,)<br/>Wiped with her hair the brine from Torquil's eyes,<br/>And clapped her hands with joy at his surprise;<br/>Led him to where the rock appeared to jut,<br/>And form a something like a Triton's hut;<br/>For all was darkness for a space, till day,<br/>Through clefts above let in a sobered ray;<br/>As in some old cathedral's glimmering aisle<br/>The dusty monuments from light recoil,<br/>Thus sadly in their refuge submarine<br/>The vault drew half her shadow from the scene.<br/><br/>Forth from her bosom the young savage drew<br/>A pine torch, strongly girded with gnatoo;<br/>A plantain-leaf o'er all, the more to keep<br/>Its latent sparkle from the sapping deep.<br/>This mantle kept it dry; then from a nook<br/>Of the same plantain-leaf a flint she took,<br/>A few shrunk withered twigs, and from the blade<br/>Of Torquil's knife struck fire, and thus arrayed<br/>The grot with torchlight. Wide it was and high,<br/>And showed a self-born Gothic canopy;<br/>The arch upreared by Nature's architect,<br/>The architrave some Earthquake might erect;<br/>The buttress from some mountain's bosom hurled,<br/>When the Poles crashed, and water was the world;<br/>Or hardened from some earth-absorbing fire,<br/>While yet the globe reeked from its funeral pyre;<br/>The fretted pinnacle, the aisle, the nave,<br/>Were there, all scooped by Darkness from her cave.<br/>There, with a little tinge of phantasy,<br/>Fantastic faces moped and mowed on high,<br/>And then a mitre or a shrine would fix<br/>The eye upon its seeming crucifix.<br/>Thus Nature played with the stalactites,<br/>And built herself a Chapel of the Seas.<br/><br/>And Neuha took her Torquil by the hand,<br/>And waved along the vault her kindled brand,<br/>And led him into each recess, and showed<br/>The secret places of their new abode.<br/>Nor these alone, for all had been prepared<br/>Before, to soothe the lover's lot she shared:<br/>The mat for rest; for dress the fresh gnatoo,<br/>And sandal oil to fence against the dew;<br/>For food the cocoa-nut, the yam, the bread<br/>Born of the fruit; for board the plantain spread<br/>With its broad leaf, or turtle-shell which bore<br/>A banquet in the flesh it covered o'er;<br/>The gourd with water recent from the rill,<br/>The ripe banana from the mellow hill;<br/>A pine-torch pile to keep undying light,<br/>And she herself, as beautiful as night,<br/>To fling her shadowy spirit o'er the scene,<br/>And make their subterranean world serene.<br/>She had foreseen, since first the stranger's sail<br/>Drew to their isle, that force or flight might fail,<br/>And formed a refuge of the rocky den<br/>For Torquil's safety from his countrymen.<br/>Each dawn had wafted there her light canoe,<br/>Laden with all the golden fruits that grew;<br/>Each eve had seen her gliding through the hour<br/>With all could cheer or deck their sparry bower;<br/>And now she spread her little store with smiles,<br/>The happiest daughter of the loving isles.<br/><br/>She, as he gazed with grateful wonder, pressed<br/>Her sheltered love to her impassioned breast;<br/>And suited to her soft caresses, told<br/>An olden tale of Love,--for Love is old,<br/>Old as eternity, but not outworn<br/>With each new being born or to be born:<br/>How a young Chief, a thousand moons ago,<br/>Diving for turtle in the depths below,<br/>Had risen, in tracking fast his ocean prey,<br/>Into the cave which round and o'er them lay;<br/>How, in some desperate feud of after-time,<br/>He sheltered there a daughter of the clime,<br/>A foe beloved, and offspring of a foe,<br/>Saved by his tribe but for a captive's woe;<br/>How, when the storm of war was stilled, he led<br/>His island clan to where the waters spread<br/>Their deep-green shadow o'er the rocky door,<br/>Then dived--it seemed as if to rise no more:<br/>His wondering mates, amazed within their bark,<br/>Or deemed him mad, or prey to the blue shark;<br/>Rowed round in sorrow the sea-girded rock,<br/>Then paused upon their paddles from the shock;<br/>When, fresh and springing from the deep, they saw<br/>A Goddess rise--so deemed they in their awe;<br/>And their companion, glorious by her side,<br/>Proud and exulting in his Mermaid bride;<br/>And how, when undeceived, the pair they bore<br/>With sounding conchs and joyous shouts to shore;<br/>How they had gladly lived and calmly died,--<br/>And why not also Torquil and his bride?<br/>Not mine to tell the rapturous caress<br/>Which followed wildly in that wild recess<br/>This tale; enough that all within that cave<br/>Was love, though buried strong as in the grave,<br/>Where Abelard, through twenty years of death,<br/>When Elo√Øsa's form was lowered beneath<br/>Their nuptial vault, his arms outstretched, and pressed<br/>The kindling ashes to his kindled breast.<br/>The waves without sang round their couch, their roar<br/>As much unheeded as if life were o'er;<br/>Within, their hearts made all their harmony,<br/>Love's broken murmur and more broken sigh.<br/><br/>And they, the cause and sharers of the shock<br/>Which left them exiles of the hollow rock,<br/>Where were they? O'er the sea for life they plied,<br/>To seek from Heaven the shelter men denied.<br/>Another course had been their choice--but where?<br/>The wave which bore them still their foes would bear,<br/>Who, disappointed of their former chase,<br/>In search of Christian now renewed their race.<br/>Eager with anger, their strong arms made way,<br/>Like vultures baffled of their previous prey.<br/>They gained upon them, all whose safety lay<br/>In some bleak crag or deeply-hidden bay:<br/>No further chance or choice remained; and right<br/>For the first further rock which met their sight<br/>They steered, to take their latest view of land,<br/>And yield as victims, or die sword in hand;<br/>Dismissed the natives and their shallop, who<br/>Would still have battled for that scanty crew;<br/>But Christian bade them seek their shore again,<br/>Nor add a sacrifice which were in vain;<br/>For what were simple bow and savage spear<br/>Against the arms which must be wielded here?<br/><br/>They landed on a wild but narrow scene,<br/>Where few but Nature's footsteps yet had been;<br/>Prepared their arms, and with that gloomy eye,<br/>Stern and sustained, of man's extremity,<br/>When Hope is gone, nor Glory's self remains<br/>To cheer resistance against death or chains.--<br/>They stood, the three, as the three hundred stood<br/>Who dyed Thermopyl√¶ with holy blood.<br/>But, ah! how different! 'tis the _cause_ makes all,<br/>Degrades or hallows courage in its fall.<br/>O'er them no fame, eternal and intense,<br/>Blazed through the clouds of Death and beckoned hence;<br/>No grateful country, smiling through her tears,<br/>Begun the praises of a thousand years;<br/>No nation's eyes would on their tomb be bent,<br/>No heroes envy them their monument;<br/>However boldly their warm blood was spilt,<br/>Their Life was shame, their Epitaph was guilt.<br/>And this they knew and felt, at least the one,<br/>The leader of the band he had undone;<br/>Who, born perchance for better things, had set<br/>His life upon a cast which lingered yet:<br/>But now the die was to be thrown, and all<br/>The chances were in favour of his fall:<br/>And such a fall! But still he faced the shock,<br/>Obdurate as a portion of the rock<br/>Whereon he stood, and fixed his levelled gun,<br/>Dark as a sullen cloud before the sun.<br/><br/>The boat drew nigh, well armed, and firm the crew<br/>To act whatever Duty bade them do;<br/>Careless of danger, as the onward wind<br/>Is of the leaves it strews, nor looks behind.<br/>And, yet, perhaps, they rather wished to go<br/>Against a nation's than a native foe,<br/>And felt that this poor victim of self-will,<br/>Briton no more, had once been Britain's still.<br/>They hailed him to surrender--no reply;<br/>Their arms were poised, and glittered in the sky.<br/>They hailed again--no answer; yet once more<br/>They offered quarter louder than before.<br/>The echoes only, from the rock's rebound,<br/>Took their last farewell of the dying sound.<br/>Then flashed the flint, and blazed the volleying flame,<br/>And the smoke rose between them and their aim,<br/>While the rock rattled with the bullets' knell,<br/>Which pealed in vain, and flattened as they fell;<br/>Then flew the only answer to be given<br/>By those who had lost all hope in earth or heaven.<br/>After the first fierce peal as they pulled nigher,<br/>They heard the voice of Christian shout, "Now, fire!"<br/>And ere the word upon the echo died,<br/>Two fell; the rest assailed the rock's rough side,<br/>And, furious at the madness of their foes,<br/>Disdained all further efforts, save to close.<br/>But steep the crag, and all without a path,<br/>Each step opposed a bastion to their wrath,<br/>While, placed 'midst clefts the least accessible,<br/>Which Christian's eye was trained to mark full well,<br/>The three maintained a strife which must not yield,<br/>In spots where eagles might have chosen to build.<br/>Their every shot told; while the assailant fell,<br/>Dashed on the shingles like the limpet shell;<br/>But still enough survived, and mounted still,<br/>Scattering their numbers here and there, until<br/>Surrounded and commanded, though not nigh<br/>Enough for seizure, near enough to die,<br/>The desperate trio held aloof their fate<br/>But by a thread, like sharks who have gorged the bait;<br/>Yet to the very last they battled well,<br/>And not a groan informed their foes _who_ fell.<br/>Christian died last--twice wounded; and once more<br/>Mercy was offered when they saw his gore;<br/>Too late for life, but not too late to die,<br/>With, though a hostile hand, to close his eye.<br/>A limb was broken, and he drooped along<br/>The crag, as doth a falcon reft of young.<br/>The sound revived him, or appeared to wake<br/>Some passion which a weakly gesture spake:<br/>He beckoned to the foremost, who drew nigh,<br/>But, as they neared, he reared his weapon high--<br/>His last ball had been aimed, but from his breast<br/>He tore the topmost button from his vest,<br/>Down the tube dashed it--levelled--fired, and smiled<br/>As his foe fell; then, like a serpent, coiled<br/>His wounded, weary form, to where the steep<br/>Looked desperate as himself along the deep;<br/>Cast one glance back, and clenched his hand, and shook<br/>His last rage 'gainst the earth which he forsook;<br/>Then plunged: the rock below received like glass<br/>His body crushed into one gory mass,<br/>With scarce a shred to tell of human form,<br/>Or fragment for the sea-bird or the worm;<br/>A fair-haired scalp, besmeared with blood and weeds,<br/>Yet reeked, the remnant of himself and deeds;<br/>Some splinters of his weapons (to the last,<br/>As long as hand could hold, he held them fast)<br/>Yet glittered, but at distance--hurled away<br/>To rust beneath the dew and dashing spray.<br/>The rest was nothing--save a life mis-spent,<br/>And soul--but who shall answer where it went?<br/>'Tis ours to bear, not judge the dead; and they<br/>Who doom to Hell, themselves are on the way,<br/>Unless these bullies of eternal pains<br/>Are pardoned their bad hearts for their worse brains.<br/><br/>The deed was over! All were gone or ta'en,<br/>The fugitive, the captive, or the slain.<br/>Chained on the deck, where once, a gallant crew,<br/>They stood with honour, were the wretched few<br/>Survivors of the skirmish on the isle;<br/>But the last rock left no surviving spoil.<br/>Cold lay they where they fell, and weltering,<br/>While o'er them flapped the sea-birds' dewy wing,<br/>Now wheeling nearer from the neighbouring surge,<br/>And screaming high their harsh and hungry dirge:<br/>But calm and careless heaved the wave below,<br/>Eternal with unsympathetic flow;<br/>Far o'er its face the Dolphins sported on,<br/>And sprung the flying fish against the sun,<br/>Till its dried wing relapsed from its brief height,<br/>To gather moisture for another flight.<br/><br/>'Twas morn; and Neuha, who by dawn of day<br/>Swam smoothly forth to catch the rising ray,<br/>And watch if aught approached the amphibious lair<br/>Where lay her lover, saw a sail in air:<br/>It flapped, it filled, and to the growing gale<br/>Bent its broad arch: her breath began to fail<br/>With fluttering fear, her heart beat thick and high,<br/>While yet a doubt sprung where its course might lie.<br/>But no! it came not; fast and far away<br/>The shadow lessened as it cleared the bay.<br/>She gazed, and flung the sea-foam from her eyes,<br/>To watch as for a rainbow in the skies.<br/>On the horizon verged the distant deck,<br/>Diminished, dwindled to a very speck--<br/>Then vanished. All was Ocean, all was Joy!<br/>Down plunged she through the cave to rouse her boy;<br/>Told all she had seen, and all she hoped, and all<br/>That happy love could augur or recall;<br/>Sprung forth again, with Torquil following free<br/>His bounding Nereid over the broad sea;<br/>Swam round the rock, to where a shallow cleft<br/>Hid the canoe that Neuha there had left<br/>Drifting along the tide, without an oar,<br/>That eve the strangers chased them from the shore;<br/>But when these vanished, she pursued her prow,<br/>Regained, and urged to where they found it now:<br/>Nor ever did more love and joy embark,<br/>Than now were wafted in that slender ark.<br/><br/>Again their own shore rises on the view,<br/>No more polluted with a hostile hue;<br/>No sullen ship lay bristling o'er the foam,<br/>A floating dungeon:--all was Hope and Home!<br/>A thousand Proas darted o'er the bay,<br/>With sounding shells, and heralded their way;<br/>The chiefs came down, around the people poured,<br/>And welcomed Torquil as a son restored;<br/>The women thronged, embracing and embraced<br/>By Neuha, asking where they had been chased,<br/>And how escaped? The tale was told; and then<br/>One acclamation rent the sky again;<br/>And from that hour a new tradition gave<br/>Their sanctuary the name of "Neuha's Cave."<br/>A hundred fires, far flickering from the height,<br/>Blazed o'er the general revel of the night,<br/>The feast in honour of the guest, returned<br/>To Peace and Pleasure, perilously earned;<br/>A night succeeded by such happy days<br/>As only the yet infant world displays.
