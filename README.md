  <summary>📚 <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> 👇 </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# 💮 Death by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Death is here and death is there,<br/>Death is busy everywhere,<br/>All around, within, beneath,<br/>Above is death--and we are death.<br/><br/>Death has set his mark and seal<br/>On all we are and all we feel,<br/>On all we know and all we fear,<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>First our pleasures die--and then<br/>Our hopes, and then our fears--and when<br/>These are dead, the debt is due,<br/>Dust claims dust--and we die too.<br/><br/>All things that we love and cherish,<br/>Like ourselves must fade and perish;<br/>Such is our rude mortal lot--<br/>Love itself would, did they not.
</p>

⭐ Star the [readme-mosaic](https://github.com/milaabl/readme-mosaic) repo for your 🐈‍⬛ avatar to be included in the next picture redrawing. The more users star the repo, the more realistic the picture will look like because the colors will get more diverse. It's a Python workflow. The author of the painting above is Arkhip Kuindzhi — a Ukrainian painter 💙💛.
