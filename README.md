# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 11 by *John Milton*

<p>
    Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn<br/>From his displeasure; in whose look serene,<br/>When angry most he seemed and most severe,<br/>What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?<br/>So spake our father penitent; nor Eve<br/>Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place<br/>Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell<br/>Before him reverent; and both confessed<br/>Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears<br/>Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air<br/>Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.<br/>Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood<br/>Praying; for from the mercy-seat above<br/>Prevenient grace descending had removed<br/>The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh<br/>Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed<br/>Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer<br/>Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight<br/>Than loudest oratory:  Yet their port<br/>Not of mean suitors; nor important less<br/>Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair<br/>In fables old, less ancient yet than these,<br/>Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore<br/>The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine<br/>Of Themis stood devout.  To Heaven their prayers<br/>Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds<br/>Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed<br/>Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad<br/>With incense, where the golden altar fumed,<br/>By their great intercessour, came in sight<br/>Before the Father's throne: them the glad Son<br/>Presenting, thus to intercede began.<br/>See$ Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung<br/>From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs<br/>And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed<br/>With incense, I thy priest before thee bring;<br/>Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed<br/>Sown with contrition in his heart, than those<br/>Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees<br/>Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen<br/>From innocence.  Now therefore, bend thine ear<br/>To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;<br/>Unskilful with what words to pray, let me<br/>Interpret for him; me, his advocate<br/>And propitiation; all his works on me,<br/>Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those<br/>Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.<br/>Accept me; and, in me, from these receive<br/>The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live<br/>Before thee reconciled, at least his days<br/>Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I<br/>To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,)<br/>To better life shall yield him: where with me<br/>All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss;<br/>Made one with me, as I with thee am one.<br/>To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.<br/>All thy request for Man, accepted Son,<br/>Obtain; all thy request was my decree:<br/>But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,<br/>The law I gave to Nature him forbids:<br/>Those pure immortal elements, that know,<br/>No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,<br/>Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off,<br/>As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,<br/>And mortal food; as may dispose him best<br/>For dissolution wrought by sin, that first<br/>Distempered all things, and of incorrupt<br/>Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts<br/>Created him endowed; with happiness,<br/>And immortality: that fondly lost,<br/>This other served but to eternize woe;<br/>Till I provided death: so death becomes<br/>His final remedy; and, after life,<br/>Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined<br/>By faith and faithful works, to second life,<br/>Waked in the renovation of the just,<br/>Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.<br/>But let us call to synod all the Blest,<br/>Through Heaven's wide bounds: from them I will not hide<br/>My judgements; how with mankind I proceed,<br/>As how with peccant Angels late they saw,<br/>And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.<br/>He ended, and the Son gave signal high<br/>To the bright minister that watched; he blew<br/>His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps<br/>When God descended, and perhaps once more<br/>To sound at general doom.  The angelick blast<br/>Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers<br/>Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring,<br/>By the waters of life, where'er they sat<br/>In fellowships of joy, the sons of light<br/>Hasted, resorting to the summons high;<br/>And took their seats; till from his throne supreme<br/>The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.<br/>O Sons, like one of us Man is become<br/>To know both good and evil, since his taste<br/>Of that defended fruit; but let him boast<br/>His knowledge of good lost, and evil got;<br/>Happier! had it sufficed him to have known<br/>Good by itself, and evil not at all.<br/>He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,<br/>My motions in him; longer than they move,<br/>His heart I know, how variable and vain,<br/>Self-left.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand<br/>Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,<br/>And live for ever, dream at least to live<br/>For ever, to remove him I decree,<br/>And send him from the garden forth to till<br/>The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.<br/>Michael, this my behest have thou in charge;<br/>Take to thee from among the Cherubim<br/>Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,<br/>Or in behalf of Man, or to invade<br/>Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:<br/>Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God<br/>Without remorse drive out the sinful pair;<br/>From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce<br/>To them, and to their progeny, from thence<br/>Perpetual banishment.  Yet, lest they faint<br/>At the sad sentence rigorously urged,<br/>(For I behold them softened, and with tears<br/>Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.<br/>If patiently thy bidding they obey,<br/>Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal<br/>To Adam what shall come in future days,<br/>As I shall thee enlighten; intermix<br/>My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed;<br/>So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:<br/>And on the east side of the garden place,<br/>Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,<br/>Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame<br/>Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright,<br/>And guard all passage to the tree of life:<br/>Lest Paradise a receptacle prove<br/>To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey;<br/>With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.<br/>He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared<br/>For swift descent; with him the cohort bright<br/>Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each<br/>Had, like a double Janus; all their shape<br/>Spangled with eyes more numerous than those<br/>Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,<br/>Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed<br/>Of Hermes, or his opiate rod.  Mean while,<br/>To re-salute the world with sacred light,<br/>Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed<br/>The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve<br/>Had ended now their orisons, and found<br/>Strength added from above; new hope to spring<br/>Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked;<br/>Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.<br/>Eve, easily my faith admit, that all<br/>The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;<br/>But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven<br/>So prevalent as to concern the mind<br/>Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,<br/>Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer<br/>Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne<br/>Even to the seat of God.  For since I sought<br/>By prayer the offended Deity to appease;<br/>Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart;<br/>Methought I saw him placable and mild,<br/>Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew<br/>That I was heard with favour; peace returned<br/>Home to my breast, and to my memory<br/>His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe;<br/>Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now<br/>Assures me that the bitterness of death<br/>Is past, and we shall live.  Whence hail to thee,<br/>Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind,<br/>Mother of all things living, since by thee<br/>Man is to live; and all things live for Man.<br/>To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.<br/>Ill-worthy I such title should belong<br/>To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained<br/>A help, became thy snare; to me reproach<br/>Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise:<br/>But infinite in pardon was my Judge,<br/>That I, who first brought death on all, am graced<br/>The source of life; next favourable thou,<br/>Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st,<br/>Far other name deserving.  But the field<br/>To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,<br/>Though after sleepless night; for see!the morn,<br/>All unconcerned with our unrest, begins<br/>Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth;<br/>I never from thy side henceforth to stray,<br/>Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined<br/>Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,<br/>What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?<br/>Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.<br/>So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate<br/>Subscribed not:  Nature first gave signs, impressed<br/>On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed,<br/>After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight<br/>The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,<br/>Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;<br/>Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,<br/>First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,<br/>Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;<br/>Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.<br/>Adam observed, and with his eye the chase<br/>Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.<br/>O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,<br/>Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows<br/>Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn<br/>Us, haply too secure, of our discharge<br/>From penalty, because from death released<br/>Some days: how long, and what till then our life,<br/>Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,<br/>And thither must return, and be no more?<br/>Why else this double object in our sight<br/>Of flight pursued in the air, and o'er the ground,<br/>One way the self-same hour? why in the east<br/>Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light<br/>More orient in yon western cloud, that draws<br/>O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,<br/>And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?<br/>He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands<br/>Down from a sky of jasper lighted now<br/>In Paradise, and on a hill made halt;<br/>A glorious apparition, had not doubt<br/>And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye.<br/>Not that more glorious, when the Angels met<br/>Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw<br/>The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;<br/>Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared<br/>In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,<br/>Against the Syrian king, who to surprise<br/>One man, assassin-like, had levied war,<br/>War unproclaimed.  The princely Hierarch<br/>In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise<br/>Possession of the garden; he alone,<br/>To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,<br/>Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,<br/>While the great visitant approached, thus spake.<br/>Eve$ now expect great tidings, which perhaps<br/>Of us will soon determine, or impose<br/>New laws to be observed; for I descry,<br/>From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,<br/>One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait,<br/>None of the meanest; some great Potentate<br/>Or of the Thrones above; such majesty<br/>Invests him coming! yet not terrible,<br/>That I should fear; nor sociably mild,<br/>As Raphael, that I should much confide;<br/>But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend,<br/>With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.<br/>He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,<br/>Not in his shape celestial, but as man<br/>Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms<br/>A military vest of purple flowed,<br/>Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain<br/>Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old<br/>In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof;<br/>His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime<br/>In manhood where youth ended; by his side,<br/>As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,<br/>Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear.<br/>Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state<br/>Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.<br/>Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs:<br/>Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death,<br/>Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,<br/>Defeated of his seisure many days<br/>Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent,<br/>And one bad act with many deeds well done<br/>Mayest cover:  Well may then thy Lord, appeased,<br/>Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim;<br/>But longer in this Paradise to dwell<br/>Permits not: to remove thee I am come,<br/>And send thee from the garden forth to till<br/>The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.<br/>He added not; for Adam at the news<br/>Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,<br/>That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen<br/>Yet all had heard, with audible lament<br/>Discovered soon the place of her retire.<br/>O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!<br/>Must I thus leave thee$ Paradise? thus leave<br/>Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,<br/>Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,<br/>Quiet though sad, the respite of that day<br/>That must be mortal to us both.  O flowers,<br/>That never will in other climate grow,<br/>My early visitation, and my last<br/> ;t even, which I bred up with tender hand<br/>From the first opening bud, and gave ye names!<br/>Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank<br/>Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?<br/>Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned<br/>With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee<br/>How shall I part, and whither wander down<br/>Into a lower world; to this obscure<br/>And wild? how shall we breathe in other air<br/>Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?<br/>Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.<br/>Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign<br/>What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart,<br/>Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine:<br/>Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes<br/>Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound;<br/>Where he abides, think there thy native soil.<br/>Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp<br/>Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,<br/>To Michael thus his humble words addressed.<br/>Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named<br/>Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem<br/>Prince above princes! gently hast thou told<br/>Thy message, which might else in telling wound,<br/>And in performing end us; what besides<br/>Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,<br/>Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring,<br/>Departure from this happy place, our sweet<br/>Recess, and only consolation left<br/>Familiar to our eyes! all places else<br/>Inhospitable appear, and desolate;<br/>Nor knowing us, nor known:  And, if by prayer<br/>Incessant I could hope to change the will<br/>Of Him who all things can, I would not cease<br/>To weary him with my assiduous cries:<br/>But prayer against his absolute decree<br/>No more avails than breath against the wind,<br/>Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:<br/>Therefore to his great bidding I submit.<br/>This most afflicts me, that, departing hence,<br/>As from his face I shall be hid, deprived<br/>His blessed countenance:  Here I could frequent<br/>With worship place by place where he vouchsafed<br/>Presence Divine; and to my sons relate,<br/>'On this mount he appeared; under this tree<br/>'Stood visible; among these pines his voice<br/>'I heard; here with him at this fountain talked:<br/>So many grateful altars I would rear<br/>Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone<br/>Of lustre from the brook, in memory,<br/>Or monument to ages; and theron<br/>Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers:<br/>In yonder nether world where shall I seek<br/>His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?<br/>For though I fled him angry, yet recalled<br/>To life prolonged and promised race, I now<br/>Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts<br/>Of glory; and far off his steps adore.<br/>To whom thus Michael with regard benign.<br/>Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth;<br/>Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills<br/>Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,<br/>Fomented by his virtual power and warmed:<br/>All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule,<br/>No despicable gift; surmise not then<br/>His presence to these narrow bounds confined<br/>Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been<br/>Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread<br/>All generations; and had hither come<br/>From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate<br/>And reverence thee, their great progenitor.<br/>But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down<br/>To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:<br/>Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain,<br/>God is, as here; and will be found alike<br/>Present; and of his presence many a sign<br/>Still following thee, still compassing thee round<br/>With goodness and paternal love, his face<br/>Express, and of his steps the track divine.<br/>Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed<br/>Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent<br/>To show thee what shall come in future days<br/>To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad<br/>Expect to hear; supernal grace contending<br/>With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn<br/>True patience, and to temper joy with fear<br/>And pious sorrow; equally inured<br/>By moderation either state to bear,<br/>Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead<br/>Safest thy life, and best prepared endure<br/>Thy mortal passage when it comes.--Ascend<br/>This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)<br/>Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;<br/>As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.<br/>To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.<br/>Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path<br/>Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit,<br/>However chastening; to the evil turn<br/>My obvious breast; arming to overcome<br/>By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,<br/>If so I may attain. -- So both ascend<br/>In the visions of God.  It was a hill,<br/>Of Paradise the highest; from whose top<br/>The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken,<br/>Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.<br/>Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round,<br/>Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set<br/>Our second Adam, in the wilderness;<br/>To show him all Earth's kingdoms, and their glory.<br/>His eye might there command wherever stood<br/>City of old or modern fame, the seat<br/>Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls<br/>Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,<br/>And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne,<br/>To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence<br/>To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul,<br/>Down to the golden Chersonese; or where<br/>The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since<br/>In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar<br/>In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance,<br/>Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken<br/>The empire of Negus to his utmost port<br/>Ercoco, and the less maritim kings<br/>Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,<br/>And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm<br/>Of Congo, and Angola farthest south;<br/>Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount<br/>The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,<br/>Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen;<br/>On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway<br/>The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw<br/>Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,<br/>And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat<br/>Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled<br/>Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons<br/>Call El Dorado.  But to nobler sights<br/>Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed,<br/>Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight<br/>Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue<br/>The visual nerve, for he had much to see;<br/>And from the well of life three drops instilled.<br/>So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,<br/>Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,<br/>That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,<br/>Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;<br/>But him the gentle Angel by the hand<br/>Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.<br/>Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold<br/>The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought<br/>In some to spring from thee; who never touched<br/>The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;<br/>Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive<br/>Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.<br/>His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,<br/>Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves<br/>New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds;<br/>I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood,<br/>Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon<br/>A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought<br/>First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf,<br/>Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next,<br/>More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,<br/>Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid<br/>The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed,<br/>On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed:<br/>His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven<br/>Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;<br/>The other's not, for his was not sincere;<br/>Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,<br/>Smote him into the midriff with a stone<br/>That beat out life; he fell;and, deadly pale,<br/>Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.<br/>Much at that sight was Adam in his heart<br/>Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.<br/>O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen<br/>To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;<br/>Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?<br/>To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.<br/>These two are brethren, Adam, and to come<br/>Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain,<br/>For envy that his brother's offering found<br/>From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact<br/>Will be avenged; and the other's faith, approved,<br/>Lose no reward; though here thou see him die,<br/>Rolling in dust and gore.  To which our sire.<br/>Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!<br/>But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way<br/>I must return to native dust?  O sight<br/>Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,<br/>Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!<br/>To whom thus Michael.  Death thou hast seen<br/>In his first shape on Man; but many shapes<br/>Of Death, and many are the ways that lead<br/>To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense<br/>More terrible at the entrance, than within.<br/>Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;<br/>By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more<br/>In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring<br/>Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew<br/>Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know<br/>What misery the inabstinence of Eve<br/>Shall bring on Men.  Immediately a place<br/>Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;<br/>A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid<br/>Numbers of all diseased; all maladies<br/>Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms<br/>Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,<br/>Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,<br/>Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,<br/>Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,<br/>And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,<br/>Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,<br/>Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.<br/>Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair<br/>Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;<br/>And over them triumphant Death his dart<br/>Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked<br/>With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.<br/>Sight so deform what heart of rock could long<br/>Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept,<br/>Though not of woman born; compassion quelled<br/>His best of man, and gave him up to tears<br/>A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;<br/>And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.<br/>O miserable mankind, to what fall<br/>Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!<br/>Better end here unborn.  Why is life given<br/>To be thus wrested from us? rather, why<br/>Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew<br/>What we receive, would either no accept<br/>Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;<br/>Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus<br/>The image of God in Man, created once<br/>So goodly and erect, though faulty since,<br/>To such unsightly sufferings be debased<br/>Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,<br/>Retaining still divine similitude<br/>In part, from such deformities be free,<br/>And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt?<br/>Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then<br/>Forsook them, when themselves they vilified<br/>To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took<br/>His image whom they served, a brutish vice,<br/>Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.<br/>Therefore so abject is their punishment,<br/>Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;<br/>Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;<br/>While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules<br/>To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they<br/>God's image did not reverence in themselves.<br/>I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.<br/>But is there yet no other way, besides<br/>These painful passages, how we may come<br/>To death, and mix with our connatural dust?<br/>There is, said Michael, if thou well observe<br/>The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,<br/>In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence<br/>Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,<br/>Till many years over thy head return:<br/>So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop<br/>Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease<br/>Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:<br/>This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive<br/>Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change<br/>To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,<br/>Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,<br/>To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,<br/>Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign<br/>A melancholy damp of cold and dry<br/>To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume<br/>The balm of life.  To whom our ancestor.<br/>Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong<br/>Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit,<br/>Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge;<br/>Which I must keep till my appointed day<br/>Of rendering up, and patiently attend<br/>My dissolution.  Michael replied.<br/>Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest<br/>Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven:<br/>And now prepare thee for another sight.<br/>He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon<br/>Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds<br/>Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound<br/>Of instruments, that made melodious chime,<br/>Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved<br/>Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch,<br/>Instinct through all proportions, low and high,<br/>Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.<br/>In other part stood one who, at the forge<br/>Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass<br/>Had melted, (whether found where casual fire<br/>Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,<br/>Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot<br/>To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream<br/>From underground;) the liquid ore he drained<br/>Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed<br/>First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought<br/>Fusil or graven in metal.  After these,<br/>But on the hither side, a different sort<br/>From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,<br/>Down to the plain descended; by their guise<br/>Just men they seemed, and all their study bent<br/>To worship God aright, and know his works<br/>Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve<br/>Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain<br/>Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!<br/>A bevy of fair women, richly gay<br/>In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung<br/>Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:<br/>The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes<br/>Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net<br/>Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose;<br/>And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,<br/>Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat<br/>They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke<br/>Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:<br/>With feast and musick all the tents resound.<br/>Such happy interview, and fair event<br/>Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,<br/>And charming symphonies, attached the heart<br/>Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,<br/>The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.<br/>True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest;<br/>Much better seems this vision, and more hope<br/>Of peaceful days portends, than those two past;<br/>Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;<br/>Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.<br/>To whom thus Michael.  Judge not what is best<br/>By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet;<br/>Created, as thou art, to nobler end<br/>Holy and pure, conformity divine.<br/>Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents<br/>Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race<br/>Who slew his brother; studious they appear<br/>Of arts that polish life, inventers rare;<br/>Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit<br/>Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.<br/>Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;<br/>For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed<br/>Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,<br/>Yet empty of all good wherein consists<br/>Woman's domestick honour and chief praise;<br/>Bred only and completed to the taste<br/>Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,<br/>To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:<br/>To these that sober race of men, whose lives<br/>Religious titled them the sons of God,<br/>Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame<br/>Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles<br/>Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy,<br/>Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which<br/>The world erelong a world of tears must weep.<br/>To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.<br/>O pity and shame, that they, who to live well<br/>Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread<br/>Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!<br/>But still I see the tenour of Man's woe<br/>Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.<br/>From Man's effeminate slackness it begins,<br/>Said the Angel, who should better hold his place<br/>By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.<br/>But now prepare thee for another scene.<br/>He looked, and saw wide territory spread<br/>Before him, towns, and rural works between;<br/>Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,<br/>Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,<br/>Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise;<br/>Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,<br/>Single or in array of battle ranged<br/>Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood;<br/>One way a band select from forage drives<br/>A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,<br/>From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock,<br/>Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,<br/>Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,<br/>But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray;<br/>With cruel tournament the squadrons join;<br/>Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies<br/>With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,<br/>Deserted:  Others to a city strong<br/>Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine,<br/>Assaulting; others from the wall defend<br/>With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire;<br/>On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.<br/>In other part the sceptered heralds call<br/>To council, in the city-gates; anon<br/>Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed,<br/>Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon,<br/>In factious opposition; till at last,<br/>Of middle age one rising, eminent<br/>In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,<br/>Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,<br/>And judgement from above: him old and young<br/>Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,<br/>Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence<br/>Unseen amid the throng: so violence<br/>Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,<br/>Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.<br/>Adam was all in tears, and to his guide<br/>Lamenting turned full sad; O!what are these,<br/>Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death<br/>Inhumanly to men, and multiply<br/>Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew<br/>His brother: for of whom such massacre<br/>Make they, but of their brethren; men of men<br/>But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven<br/>Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?<br/>To whom thus Michael.  These are the product<br/>Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest;<br/>Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves<br/>Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed,<br/>Produce prodigious births of body or mind.<br/>Such were these giants, men of high renown;<br/>For in those days might only shall be admired,<br/>And valour and heroick virtue called;<br/>To overcome in battle, and subdue<br/>Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite<br/>Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch<br/>Of human glory; and for glory done<br/>Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours<br/>Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods;<br/>Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.<br/>Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth;<br/>And what most merits fame, in silence hid.<br/>But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst<br/>The only righteous in a world preverse,<br/>And therefore hated, therefore so beset<br/>With foes, for daring single to be just,<br/>And utter odious truth, that God would come<br/>To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High<br/>Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds<br/>Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God<br/>High in salvation and the climes of bliss,<br/>Exempt from death; to show thee what reward<br/>Awaits the good; the rest what punishment;<br/>Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.<br/>He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed;<br/>The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;<br/>All now was turned to jollity and game,<br/>To luxury and riot, feast and dance;<br/>Marrying or prostituting, as befel,<br/>Rape or adultery, where passing fair<br/>Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.<br/>At length a reverend sire among them came,<br/>And of their doings great dislike declared,<br/>And testified against their ways; he oft<br/>Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,<br/>Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached<br/>Conversion and repentance, as to souls<br/>In prison, under judgements imminent:<br/>But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased<br/>Contending, and removed his tents far off;<br/>Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,<br/>Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;<br/>Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth;<br/>Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door<br/>Contrived; and of provisions laid in large,<br/>For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!<br/>Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,<br/>Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught<br/>Their order: last the sire and his three sons,<br/>With their four wives; and God made fast the door.<br/>Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings<br/>Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove<br/>From under Heaven; the hills to their supply<br/>Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,<br/>Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky<br/>Like a dark cieling stood; down rushed the rain<br/>Impetuous; and continued, till the earth<br/>No more was seen: the floating vessel swum<br/>Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow<br/>Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else<br/>Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp<br/>Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea,<br/>Sea without shore; and in their palaces,<br/>Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped<br/>And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late,<br/>All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.<br/>How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold<br/>The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,<br/>Depopulation!  Thee another flood,<br/>Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned,<br/>And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared<br/>By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last,<br/>Though comfortless; as when a father mourns<br/>His children, all in view destroyed at once;<br/>And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint.<br/>O visions ill foreseen!  Better had I<br/>Lived ignorant of future! so had borne<br/>My part of evil only, each day's lot<br/>Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed<br/>The burden of many ages, on me light<br/>At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth<br/>Abortive, to torment me ere their being,<br/>With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek<br/>Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall<br/>Him or his children; evil he may be sure,<br/>Which neither his foreknowing can prevent;<br/>And he the future evil shall no less<br/>In apprehension than in substance feel,<br/>Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,<br/>Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped<br/>Famine and anguish will at last consume,<br/>Wandering that watery desart:  I had hope,<br/>When violence was ceased, and war on earth,<br/>All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned<br/>With length of happy days the race of Man;<br/>But I was far deceived; for now I see<br/>Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.<br/>How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide,<br/>And whether here the race of Man will end.<br/>To whom thus Michael.  Those, whom last thou sawest<br/>In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they<br/>First seen in acts of prowess eminent<br/>And great exploits, but of true virtue void;<br/>Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast<br/>Subduing nations, and achieved thereby<br/>Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey;<br/>Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,<br/>Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride<br/>Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.<br/>The conquered also, and enslaved by war,<br/>Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose<br/>And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned<br/>In sharp contest of battle found no aid<br/>Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,<br/>Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,<br/>Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords<br/>Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear<br/>More than enough, that temperance may be tried:<br/>So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved;<br/>Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;<br/>One man except, the only son of light<br/>In a dark age, against example good,<br/>Against allurement, custom, and a world<br/>Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn,<br/>The grand-child, with twelve sons encreased, departs<br/>From Canaan, to a land hereafter called<br/>Egypt, divided by the river Nile;<br/>See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths<br/>Into the sea:  To sojourn in that land<br/>He comes, invited by a younger son<br/>In time of dearth; a son, whose worthy deeds<br/>Raise him to be the second in that realm<br/>Of Pharaoh:  There he dies, and leaves his race<br/>Growing into a nation, and now grown<br/>Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks<br/>To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests<br/>Or violence, he of their wicked ways<br/>Shall them admonish; and before them set<br/>The paths of righteousness, how much more safe<br/>And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come<br/>On their impenitence; and shall return<br/>Of them derided, but of God observed<br/>The one just man alive; by his command<br/>Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst,<br/>To save himself, and houshold, from amidst<br/>A world devote to universal wrack.<br/>No sooner he, with them of man and beast<br/>Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged,<br/>And sheltered round; but all the cataracts<br/>Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour<br/>Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep,<br/>Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp<br/>Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise<br/>Above the highest hills:  Then shall this mount<br/>Of Paradise by might of waves be moved<br/>Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,<br/>With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,<br/>Down the great river to the opening gulf,<br/>And there take root an island salt and bare,<br/>The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang:<br/>To teach thee that God attributes to place<br/>No sanctity, if none be thither brought<br/>By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.<br/>And now, what further shall ensue, behold.<br/>He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood,<br/>Which now abated; for the clouds were fled,<br/>Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry,<br/>Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed;<br/>And the clear sun on his wide watery glass<br/>Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,<br/>As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink<br/>From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole<br/>With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt<br/>His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.<br/>The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,<br/>Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.<br/>And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear;<br/>With clamour thence the rapid currents drive,<br/>Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.<br/>Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies,<br/>And after him, the surer messenger,<br/>A dove sent forth once and again to spy<br/>Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light:<br/>The second time returning, in his bill<br/>An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign:<br/>Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark<br/>The ancient sire descends, with all his train;<br/>Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,<br/>Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds<br/>A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow<br/>Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,<br/>Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.<br/>Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,<br/>Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.<br/>O thou, who future things canst represent<br/>As present, heavenly Instructer!  I revive<br/>At this last sight; assured that Man shall live,<br/>With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.<br/>Far less I now lament for one whole world<br/>Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice<br/>For one man found so perfect, and so just,<br/>That God vouchsafes to raise another world<br/>From him, and all his anger to forget.<br/>But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven<br/>Distended, as the brow of God appeased?<br/>Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind<br/>The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,<br/>Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?<br/>To whom the Arch-Angel.  Dextrously thou aimest;<br/>So willingly doth God remit his ire,<br/>Though late repenting him of Man depraved;<br/>Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw<br/>The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh<br/>Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,<br/>Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,<br/>That he relents, not to blot out mankind;<br/>And makes a covenant never to destroy<br/>The earth again by flood; nor let the sea<br/>Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world,<br/>With man therein or beast; but, when he brings<br/>Over the earth a cloud, will therein set<br/>His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look,<br/>And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,<br/>Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,<br/>Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new,<br/>Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
