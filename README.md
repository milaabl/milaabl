  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Task: Book V, The Winter Morning Walk (excerpts) by *William Cowper*

<p>
    'Tis morning; and the sun, with ruddy orb<br/>Ascending, fires th' horizon: while the clouds,<br/>That crowd away before the driving wind,<br/>More ardent as the disk emerges more,<br/>Resemble most some city in a blaze,<br/>Seen through the leafless wood. His slanting ray<br/>Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale,<br/>And, tinging all with his own rosy hue,<br/>From ev'ry herb and ev'ry spiry blade<br/>Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field.<br/>Mine, spindling into longitude immense,<br/>In spite of gravity, and sage remark<br/>That I myself am but a fleeting shade,<br/>Provokes me to a smile. With eye askance<br/>I view the muscular proportion'd limb<br/>Transform'd to a lean shank. The shapeless pair,<br/>As they design'd to mock me, at my side<br/>Take step for step; and, as I near approach<br/>The cottage, walk along the plaster'd wall,<br/>Prepost'rous sight! the legs without the man.<br/>The verdure of the plain lies buried deep<br/>Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents,<br/>And coarser grass, upspearing o'er the rest,<br/>Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine<br/>Conspicuous, and, in bright apparel clad<br/>And fledg'd with icy feathers, nod superb.<br/>The cattle mourn in corners where the fence<br/>Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep<br/>In unrecumbent sadness. There they wait<br/>Their wonted fodder; not like hung'ring man,<br/>Fretful if unsupply'd; but silent, meek,<br/>And patient of the slow-pac'd swain's delay.<br/>He from the stack carves out th' accustom'd load,<br/>Deep-plunging, and again deep-plunging oft,<br/>His broad keen knife into the solid mass:<br/>Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,<br/>With such undeviating and even force<br/>He severs it away: no needless care,<br/>Lest storms should overset the leaning pile<br/>Deciduous, or its own unbalanc'd weight....<br/><br/><br/>'Tis liberty alone that gives the flower<br/>Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,<br/>And we are weeds without it. All constraint,<br/>Except what wisdom lays on evil men,<br/>Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes<br/>Their progress in the road of science; blinds<br/>The eyesight of discovery, and begets,<br/>In those that suffer it, a sordid mind<br/>Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit<br/>To be the tenant of man's noble form.<br/>Thee therefore, still, blameworthy as thou art,<br/>With all thy loss of empire, and though squeez'd<br/>By public exigence till annual food<br/>Fails for the craving hunger of the state,<br/>Thee I account still happy, and the chief<br/>Among the nations, seeing thou art free,<br/>My native nook of earth! . . ....<br/><br/><br/>But there is yet a liberty unsung<br/>By poets, and by senators unprais'd,<br/>Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the pow'rs<br/>Of earth and hell confederate take away;<br/>A liberty which persecution, fraud,<br/>Oppression, prisons, have no pow'r to bind;<br/>Which whoso tastes can be enslav'd no more.<br/>'Tis liberty of heart, deriv'd from Heav'n,<br/>Bought with his blood who gave it to mankind,<br/>And seal'd with the same token. It is held<br/>By charter, and that charter sanction'd sure<br/>By th' unimpeachable and awful oath<br/>And promise of a God. His other gifts<br/>All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his,<br/>And are august, but this transcends them all.
</p>
