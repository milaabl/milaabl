  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ As I Sat Alone by Blue Ontario‚Äôs Shores. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    1<br/>AS I sat alone, by blue Ontario‚Äôs shore,<br/>As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return‚Äôd, and the dead that return no<br/>    more,<br/>A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me;<br/>Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America‚Äîchant me<br/>    the<br/>  carol of victory;<br/>And strike up the marches of Libertad‚Äîmarches more powerful yet;<br/>And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy.<br/><br/>(Democracy‚Äîthe destin‚Äôd conqueror‚Äîyet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere,<br/>And Death and infidelity at every step.)<br/><br/>2<br/>A Nation announcing itself,<br/>I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,<br/>I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.<br/><br/>A breed whose proof is in time and deeds;<br/>What we are, we are‚Äînativity is answer enough to objections;<br/>We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,<br/>We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,<br/>We are executive in ourselves‚ÄîWe are sufficient in the variety of ourselves,<br/>We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;<br/>We stand self-pois‚Äôd in the middle, branching thence over the world;<br/>From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.<br/><br/>Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,<br/>Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only.<br/><br/>(O mother! O sisters dear!<br/>If we are lost, no victor else has destroy‚Äôd us;<br/>It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)<br/><br/>3<br/>Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme?<br/>There can be any number of Supremes‚ÄîOne does not countervail another, any more than<br/>    one<br/>  eyesight countervails another, or one life countervails another.<br/><br/>All is eligible to all,<br/>All is for individuals‚ÄîAll is for you,<br/>No condition is prohibited‚Äînot God‚Äôs, or any.<br/><br/>All comes by the body‚Äîonly health puts you rapport with the universe.<br/><br/>Produce great persons, the rest follows.<br/><br/>4<br/>America isolated I sing;<br/>I say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much poison in The States.<br/><br/><br/>(How dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for America?<br/>For our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?)<br/><br/>Piety and conformity to them that like!<br/>Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!<br/>I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,<br/>Crying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your lives!<br/><br/>I am he who walks the States with a barb‚Äôd tongue, questioning every one I meet;<br/>Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?<br/>Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?<br/><br/>(With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of many children!<br/>These clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.)<br/><br/>O lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before?<br/>If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me.<br/><br/>Fear grace‚ÄîFear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,<br/>Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;<br/>Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,<br/>Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men.<br/><br/>Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,<br/>America brings builders, and brings its own styles.<br/><br/>The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and pass‚Äôd to other<br/>    spheres,<br/>A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.<br/><br/>America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all hazards,<br/>Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound‚Äîinitiates the true use of precedents,<br/>Does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under their forms,<br/>Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne from the house,<br/>Perceives that it waits a little while in the door‚Äîthat it was fittest for its days,<br/>That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches,<br/>And that he shall be fittest for his days.<br/><br/>Any period, one nation must lead,<br/>One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.<br/><br/>These States are the amplest poem,<br/>Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,<br/>Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night,<br/>Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,<br/>Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul loves,<br/>Here the flowing trains‚Äîhere the crowds, equality, diversity, the Soul loves.<br/><br/>6<br/>Land of lands, and bards to corroborate!<br/>Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred face,<br/>To him the hereditary countenance bequeath‚Äôd, both mother‚Äôs and father‚Äôs,<br/>His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,<br/>Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,<br/>Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,<br/>Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with incomparable love,<br/>Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,<br/>Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,<br/>Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,<br/>Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes‚ÄîColumbia, Niagara, Hudson,<br/>    spending<br/>  themselves lovingly in him,<br/>If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he stretching with them north<br/>    or<br/>  south,<br/>Spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is between them,<br/>Growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust,<br/>  chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia,<br/>Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,<br/>He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with northern transparent ice,<br/>Off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,<br/>Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-hawk, mocking-bird,<br/>  night-heron, and eagle;<br/>His spirit surrounding his country‚Äôs spirit, unclosed to good and evil,<br/>Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,<br/>Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,<br/>Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle,<br/>The haughty defiance of the Year 1‚Äîwar, peace, the formation of the Constitution,<br/>The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,<br/>The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and impregnable,<br/>The unsurvey‚Äôd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters, trappers;<br/>Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the gestation of new States,<br/>Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up from the uttermost<br/>    parts;<br/>Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially the young men,<br/>Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships‚Äîthe gait they have of persons<br/>    who<br/>  never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors,<br/>The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their<br/>  phrenology,<br/>The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong‚Äôd,<br/>The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, good temper, and<br/>  open-handedness‚Äîthe whole composite make,<br/>The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,<br/>The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement of the population,<br/>The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,<br/>Wharf-hemm‚Äôd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all points,<br/>Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east, north-west,<br/>    south-west,<br/>Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,<br/>Slavery‚Äîthe murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the<br/>    rest;<br/>On and on to the grapple with it‚ÄîAssassin! then your life or ours be the<br/>    stake‚Äîand<br/>  respite no more.<br/><br/>7<br/>(Lo! high toward heaven, this day,<br/>Libertad! from the conqueress‚Äô field return‚Äôd,<br/>I mark the new aureola around your head;<br/>No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,<br/>With war‚Äôs flames, and the lambent lightnings playing,<br/>And your port immovable where you stand;<br/>With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench‚Äôd and lifted fist,<br/>And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly crush‚Äôd beneath<br/>    you;<br/>The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his senseless scorn, bearing the<br/>  murderous knife;<br/>‚ÄîLo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so much!<br/>To-day a carrion dead and damn‚Äôd, the despised of all the earth!<br/>An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn‚Äôd.)<br/><br/>8<br/>Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive, and ever keeps vista;<br/>Others adorn the past‚Äîbut you, O days of the present, I adorn you!<br/>O days of the future, I believe in you! I isolate myself for your sake;<br/>O America, because you build for mankind, I build for you!<br/>O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with decision and science,<br/>I lead the present with friendly hand toward the future.<br/><br/>Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!<br/>But damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain, pains, dismay, feebleness<br/>    it<br/>  is bequeathing.<br/><br/>9<br/>I listened to the Phantom by Ontario‚Äôs shore,<br/>I heard the voice arising, demanding bards;<br/>By them, all native and grand‚Äîby them alone can The States be fused into the compact<br/>  organism of a Nation.<br/><br/>To hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no account;<br/>That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle, as the hold of<br/>    the<br/>  limbs of the body, or the fibres of plants.<br/><br/>Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full of poetical stuff, most need poets,<br/>    and<br/>  are to have the greatest, and use them the greatest;<br/>Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall.<br/><br/>(Soul of love, and tongue of fire!<br/>Eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world!<br/>‚ÄîAh, mother! prolific and full in all besides‚Äîyet how long barren, barren?)<br/><br/>10<br/>Of These States, the poet is the equable man,<br/>Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their full returns,<br/><br/>Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,<br/>He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither more nor less,<br/>He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,<br/>He is the equalizer of his age and land,<br/>He supplies what wants supplying‚Äîhe checks what wants checking,<br/>In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building populous<br/>    towns,<br/>  encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the Soul, health,<br/>  immortality, government;<br/>In war, he is the best backer of the war‚Äîhe fetches artillery as good as the<br/>  engineer‚Äôs‚Äîhe can make every word he speaks draw blood;<br/>The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady faith,<br/>He is no argurer, he is judgment‚Äî(Nature accepts him absolutely;)<br/>He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a helpless thing;<br/>As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith,<br/>His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,<br/>In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,<br/>He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,<br/>He sees eternity in men and women‚Äîhe does not see men and women as dreams or dots.<br/><br/>For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,<br/>For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,<br/>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.<br/><br/>Without extinction is Liberty! without retrograde is Equality!<br/>They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;<br/>Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always ready to fall for<br/>    Liberty.<br/><br/>11<br/>For the great Idea!<br/>That, O my brethren‚Äîthat is the mission of Poets.<br/><br/>Songs of stern defiance, ever ready,<br/>Songs of the rapid arming, and the march,<br/>The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we know,<br/>Warlike flag of the great Idea.<br/><br/>(Angry cloth I saw there leaping!<br/>I stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;<br/>I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight‚ÄîO the hard-contested fight!<br/>O the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls scream!<br/><br/>The battle-front forms amid the smoke‚Äîthe volleys pour incessant from the line;<br/>Hark! the ringing word, Charge!‚Äînow the tussle, and the furious maddening<br/>    yells;<br/>Now the corpses tumble curl‚Äôd upon the ground,<br/>Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,<br/>Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)<br/><br/>12<br/>Are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in The States?<br/>The place is august‚Äîthe terms obdurate.<br/><br/>Who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and mind,<br/>He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe, himself,<br/>He shall surely be question‚Äôd beforehand by me with many and stern questions.<br/><br/>Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to America?<br/>Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men?<br/>Have you learn‚Äôd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography, pride, freedom,<br/>  friendship, of the land? its substratums and objects?<br/>Have you consider‚Äôd the organic compact of the first day of the first year of<br/>  Independence, sign‚Äôd by the Commissioners, ratified by The States, and read by<br/>    Washington<br/>  at the head of the army?<br/>Have you possess‚Äôd yourself of the Federal Constitution?<br/>Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them, and assumed the poems<br/>    and<br/>  processes of Democracy?<br/>Are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the bodies of men,<br/>    womanhood,<br/>  amativeness, angers, teach?<br/>Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?<br/>Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, fierce contentions? are<br/>    you<br/>  very strong? are you really of the whole people?<br/>Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion?<br/>Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to life itself?<br/>Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of These States?<br/>Have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?<br/>Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the last-born? little and<br/>    big?<br/>  and for the errant?<br/><br/>What is this you bring my America?<br/>Is it uniform with my country?<br/>Is it not something that has been better told or done before?<br/>Have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship?<br/>Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause in it?<br/>Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians, literats, of enemies‚Äô<br/>  lands?<br/>Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?<br/>Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?<br/>Does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of the Union, in that secession war?<br/>Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?<br/>Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air‚Äîto appear again in my strength, gait,<br/>    face?<br/>Have real employments contributed to it?

with subtle sense severe‚Äîwith the naked sword in your hand,<br/>I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)<br/><br/>16<br/>Underneath all, nativity,<br/>I swear I will stand by my own nativity‚Äîpious or impious, so be it;<br/>I swear I am charm‚Äôd with nothing except nativity,<br/>Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.<br/><br/>Underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and women,<br/>I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing love for men and<br/>    women,<br/>After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and women.<br/><br/>I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,<br/>(Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose manners favor the audacity and sublime<br/>  turbulence of The States.)<br/><br/>Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments, ownerships, I swear I<br/>    perceive<br/>  other lessons,<br/>Underneath all, to me is myself‚Äîto you, yourself‚Äî(the same monotonous old song.)<br/><br/><br/>17<br/>O I see now, flashing, that this America is only you and me,<br/>Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,<br/>Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me,<br/>Its Congress is you and me‚Äîthe officers, capitols, armies, ships, are you and me,<br/>Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,<br/>The war‚Äîthat war so bloody and grim‚Äîthe war I will henceforth forget‚Äîwas<br/>    you and<br/>  me,<br/>Natural and artificial are you and me,<br/>Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,<br/>Past, present, future, are you and me.<br/><br/>18<br/>I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself,<br/>Not any part of America, good or bad,<br/>Not the promulgation of Liberty‚Äînot to cheer up slaves and horrify foreign despots,<br/>Not to build for that which builds for mankind,<br/>Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,<br/>Not to justify science, nor the march of equality,<br/>Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time.<br/><br/>I swear I am for those that have never been master‚Äôd!<br/>For men and women whose tempers have never been master‚Äôd,<br/>For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.<br/><br/>I swear I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth!<br/>Who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all.<br/><br/>I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things!<br/>I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me!<br/>I will make cities and civilizations defer to me!<br/>This is what I have learnt from America‚Äîit is the amount‚Äîand it I teach again.<br/><br/>(Democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim‚Äôd at your breast,<br/>I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children‚Äîsaw in dreams your dilating form;<br/>Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)<br/><br/>19<br/>I will confront these shows of the day and night!<br/>I will know if I am to be less than they!<br/>I will see if I am not as majestic as they!<br/>I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they!<br/>I will see if I am to be less generous than they!<br/>I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have meaning!<br/>I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves, and I am not to be<br/>    enough<br/>  for myself.<br/><br/>20<br/>I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes,<br/>Copious as you are, I absorb you all in myself, and become the master myself.<br/><br/>America isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself?<br/>These States‚Äîwhat are they except myself?<br/><br/>I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked‚Äîit is for my sake,<br/>I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms.<br/><br/>(Mother! bend down, bend close to me your face!<br/>I know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for;<br/>I know not fruition‚Äôs success‚Äîbut I know that through war and peace your work<br/>    goes<br/>  on, and must yet go on.)<br/><br/>21<br/>.... Thus, by blue Ontario‚Äôs shore,<br/>While the winds fann‚Äôd me, and the waves came trooping toward me,<br/>I thrill‚Äôd with the Power‚Äôs pulsations‚Äîand the charm of my theme was upon<br/>    me,<br/>Till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me.<br/><br/>And I saw the free Souls of poets;<br/>The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,<br/>Strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me.<br/><br/>22<br/>O my rapt verse, my call‚Äîmock me not!<br/>Not for the bards of the past‚Äînot to invoke them have I launch‚Äôd you forth,<br/>Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario‚Äôs shores,<br/>Have I sung so capricious and loud, my savage song.<br/><br/>Bards for my own land, only, I invoke;<br/>(For the war, the war is over‚Äîthe field is clear‚Äôd,)<br/>Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward,<br/>To cheer, O mother, your boundless, expectant soul.<br/><br/>Bards grand as these days so grand!<br/>Bards of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the war, the war is over!)<br/><br/>Yet Bards of the latent armies‚Äîa million soldiers waiting, ever-ready,<br/>Bards towering like hills‚Äî(no more these dots, these pigmies, these little piping<br/>    straws,<br/>  these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass for poets;)<br/>Bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning‚Äôs fork‚Äôd stripes!<br/>Ample Ohio‚Äôs bards‚Äîbards for California! inland bards‚Äîbards of the war;)<br/>(As a wheel turns on its axle, so I find my chants turning finally on the war;)<br/>Bards of pride! Bards tallying the ocean‚Äôs roar, and the swooping eagle‚Äôs<br/>    scream!<br/>You, by my charm, I invoke!
