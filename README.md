# üíÆ Marianne's Dream by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    A pale Dream came to a Lady fair,<br/>And said, A boon, a boon, I pray!<br/>I know the secrets of the air,<br/>And things are lost in the glare of day,<br/>Which I can make the sleeping see,<br/>If they will put their trust in me.<br/><br/>And thou shalt know of things unknown,<br/>If thou wilt let me rest between<br/>The veiny lids, whose fringe is thrown<br/>Over thine eyes so dark and sheen:<br/>And half in hope, and half in fright,<br/>The Lady closed her eyes so bright.<br/><br/>At first all deadly shapes were driven<br/>Tumultuously across her sleep,<br/>And o'er the vast cope of bending heaven<br/>All ghastly-visaged clouds did sweep;<br/>And the Lady ever looked to spy<br/>If the golden sun shone forth on high.<br/><br/>And as towards the east she turned,<br/>She saw aloft in the morning air,<br/>Which now with hues of sunrise burned,<br/>A great black Anchor rising there;<br/>And wherever the Lady turned her eyes,<br/>It hung before her in the skies.<br/><br/>The sky was blue as the summer sea,<br/>The depths were cloudless overhead,<br/>The air was calm as it could be,<br/>There was no sight or sound of dread,<br/>But that black Anchor floating still<br/>Over the piny eastern hill.<br/><br/>The Lady grew sick with a weight of fear<br/>To see that Anchor ever hanging,<br/>And veiled her eyes; she then did hear<br/>The sound as of a dim low clanging,<br/>And looked abroad if she might know<br/>Was it aught else, or but the flow<br/>Of the blood in her own veins, to and fro.<br/><br/>There was a mist in the sunless air,<br/>Which shook as it were with an earthquake's shock,<br/>But the very weeds that blossomed there<br/>Were moveless, and each mighty rock<br/>Stood on its basis steadfastly;<br/>The Anchor was seen no more on high.<br/><br/>But piled around, with summits hid<br/>In lines of cloud at intervals,<br/>Stood many a mountain pyramid<br/>Among whose everlasting walls<br/>Two mighty cities shone, and ever<br/>Through the red mist their domes did quiver.<br/><br/>On two dread mountains, from whose crest,<br/>Might seem, the eagle, for her brood,<br/>Would ne'er have hung her dizzy nest,<br/>Those tower-encircled cities stood.<br/>A vision strange such towers to see,<br/>Sculptured and wrought so gorgeously,<br/>Where human art could never be.<br/><br/>And columns framed of marble white,<br/>And giant fanes, dome over dome<br/>Piled, and triumphant gates, all bright<br/>With workmanship, which could not come<br/>From touch of mortal instrument,<br/>Shot o'er the vales, or lustre lent<br/>From its own shapes magnificent.<br/><br/>But still the Lady heard that clang<br/>Filling the wide air far away;<br/>And still the mist whose light did hang<br/>Among the mountains shook alway,<br/>So that the Lady's heart beat fast,<br/>As half in joy, and half aghast,<br/>On those high domes her look she cast.<br/><br/>Sudden, from out that city sprung<br/>A light that made the earth grow red;<br/>Two flames that each with quivering tongue<br/>Licked its high domes, and overhead<br/>Among those mighty towers and fanes<br/>Dropped fire, as a volcano rains<br/>Its sulphurous ruin on the plains.<br/><br/>And hark! a rush as if the deep<br/>Had burst its bonds; she looked behind<br/>And saw over the western steep<br/>A raging flood descend, and wind<br/>Through that wide vale; she felt no fear,<br/>But said within herself, 'Tis clear<br/>These towers are Nature's own, and she<br/>To save them has sent forth the sea.<br/><br/>And now those raging billows came<br/>Where that fair Lady sate, and she<br/>Was borne towards the showering flame<br/>By the wild waves heaped tumultuously.<br/>And, on a little plank, the flow<br/>Of the whirlpool bore her to and fro.<br/><br/>The flames were fiercely vomited<br/>From every tower and every dome,<br/>And dreary light did widely shed<br/>O'er that vast flood's suspended foam,<br/>Beneath the smoke which hung its night<br/>On the stained cope of heaven's light.<br/><br/>The plank whereon that Lady sate<br/>Was driven through the chasms, about and about,<br/>Between the peaks so desolate<br/>Of the drowning mountains, in and out,<br/>As the thistle-beard on a whirlwind sails--<br/>While the flood was filling those hollow vales.<br/><br/>At last her plank an eddy crossed,<br/>And bore her to the city's wall,<br/>Which now the flood had reached almost;<br/>It might the stoutest heart appal<br/>To hear the fire roar and hiss<br/>Through the domes of those mighty palaces.<br/><br/>The eddy whirled her round and round<br/>Before a gorgeous gate, which stood<br/>Piercing the clouds of smoke which bound<br/>Its aery arch with light like blood;<br/>She looked on that gate of marble clear,<br/>With wonder that extinguished fear.<br/><br/>For it was filled with sculptures rarest,<br/>Of forms most beautiful and strange,<br/>Like nothing human, but the fairest<br/>Of winged shapes, whose legions range<br/>Throughout the sleep of those that are,<br/>Like this same Lady, good and fair.<br/><br/>And as she looked, still lovelier grew<br/>Those marble forms;--the sculptor sure<br/>Was a strong spirit, and the hue<br/>Of his own mind did there endure<br/>After the touch, whose power had braided<br/>Such grace, was in some sad change faded.<br/><br/>She looked, the flames were dim, the flood<br/>Grew tranquil as a woodland river<br/>Winding through hills in solitude;<br/>Those marble shapes then seemed to quiver,<br/>And their fair limbs to float in motion,<br/>Like weeds unfolding in the ocean.<br/><br/>And their lips moved; one seemed to speak,<br/>When suddenly the mountains cracked,<br/>And through the chasm the flood did break<br/>With an earth-uplifting cataract:<br/>The statues gave a joyous scream,<br/>And on its wings the pale thin Dream<br/>Lifted the Lady from the stream.<br/><br/>The dizzy flight of that phantom pale<br/>Waked the fair Lady from her sleep,<br/>And she arose, while from the veil<br/>Of her dark eyes the Dream did creep,<br/>And she walked about as one who knew<br/>That sleep has sights as clear and true<br/>As any waking eyes can view.
