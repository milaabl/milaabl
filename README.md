# üíÆ The Glory by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    THE glory of the beauty of the morning,--<br/>The cuckoo crying over the untouched dew;<br/>The blackbird that has found it, and the dove<br/>That tempts me on to something sweeter than love;<br/>White clouds ranged even and fair as new-mown hay;<br/>The heat, the stir, the sublime vacancy<br/>Of sky and meadow and forest and my own heart:--<br/>The glory invites me, yet it leaves me scorning<br/>All I can ever do, all I can be,<br/>Beside the lovely of motion, shape, and hue,<br/>The happiness I fancy fit to dwell<br/>In beauty's presence. Shall I now this day<br/>Begin to seek as far as heaven, as hell,<br/>Wisdom or strength to match this beauty, start<br/>And tread the pale dust pitted with small dark drops,<br/>In hope to find whatever it is I seek,<br/>Hearkening to short-lived happy-seeming things<br/>That we know naught of, in the hazel copse?<br/>Or must I be content with discontent<br/>As larks and swallows are perhaps with wings?<br/>And shall I ask at the day's end once more<br/>What beauty is, and what I can have meant<br/>By happiness? And shall I let all go,<br/>Glad, weary, or both? Or shall I perhaps know<br/>That I was happy oft and oft before,<br/>Awhile forgetting how I am fast pent,<br/>How dreary-swift, with naught to travel to,<br/>Is Time? I cannot bite the day to the core.
</p>
