<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Prometheus Unbound.  a Lyrical Drama in Four Acts by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    AUDISNE HAEC AMPHIARAE, SUB TERRAM ABDITE?<br/><br/>ACT 1.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Monarch of Gods and DAEmons, and all Spirits<br/>But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds<br/>Which Thou and I alone of living things<br/>Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth<br/>Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou<br/>Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise,<br/>And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts,<br/>With fear and self-contempt and barren hope.<br/>Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,<br/>Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn,<br/>O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge.<br/>Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours,<br/>And moments aye divided by keen pangs<br/>Till they seemed years, torture and solitude,<br/>Scorn and despair,--these are mine empire:--<br/>More glorious far than that which thou surveyest<br/>From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God!<br/>Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame<br/>Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here<br/>Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain,<br/>Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb,<br/>Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life.<br/>Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!<br/><br/>No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure.<br/>I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt?<br/>I ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun,<br/>Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm,<br/>Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below,<br/>Have its deaf waves not heard my agony?<br/>Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!<br/><br/>The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears<br/>Of their moon-freezing crystals; the bright chains<br/>Eat with their burning cold into my bones.<br/>Heaven's winged hound, polluting from thy lips<br/>His beak in poison not his own, tears up<br/>My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by,<br/>The ghastly people of the realm of dream,<br/>Mocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are charged<br/>To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds<br/>When the rocks split and close again behind:<br/>While from their loud abysses howling throng<br/>The genii of the storm, urging the rage<br/>Of whirlwind, and afflict me with keen hail.<br/>And yet to me welcome is day and night,<br/>Whether one breaks the hoar-frost of the morn,<br/>Or starry, dim, and slow, the other climbs<br/>The leaden-coloured east; for then they lead<br/>The wingless, crawling hours, one among whom<br/>--As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim--<br/>Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood<br/>From these pale feet, which then might trample thee<br/>If they disdained not such a prostrate slave.<br/>Disdain! Ah, no! I pity thee. What ruin<br/>Will hunt thee undefended through wide Heaven!<br/>How will thy soul, cloven to its depth with terror,<br/>Gape like a hell within! I speak in grief,<br/>Not exultation, for I hate no more,<br/>As then ere misery made me wise. The curse<br/>Once breathed on thee I would recall. Ye Mountains,<br/>Whose many-voiced Echoes, through the mist<br/>Of cataracts, flung the thunder of that spell!<br/>Ye icy Springs, stagnant with wrinkling frost,<br/>Which vibrated to hear me, and then crept<br/>Shuddering through India! Thou serenest Air,<br/>Through which the Sun walks burning without beams!<br/>And ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poised wings<br/>Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss,<br/>As thunder, louder than your own, made rock<br/>The orbed world! If then my words had power,<br/>Though I am changed so that aught evil wish<br/>Is dead within; although no memory be<br/>Of what is hate, let them not lose it now!<br/>What was that curse? for ye all heard me speak.<br/><br/>FIRST VOICE (FROM THE MOUNTAINS):<br/>Thrice three hundred thousand years<br/>O'er the Earthquake's couch we stood:<br/>Oft, as men convulsed with fears,<br/>We trembled in our multitude.<br/><br/>SECOND VOICE (FROM THE SPRINGS):<br/>Thunderbolts had parched our water,<br/>We had been stained with bitter blood,<br/>And had run mute, 'mid shrieks of slaughter,<br/>Thro' a city and a solitude.<br/><br/>THIRD VOICE (FROM THE AIR):<br/>I had clothed, since Earth uprose,<br/>Its wastes in colours not their own,<br/>And oft had my serene repose<br/>Been cloven by many a rending groan.<br/><br/>FOURTH VOICE (FROM THE WHIRLWINDS):<br/>We had soared beneath these mountains<br/>Unresting ages; nor had thunder,<br/>Nor yon volcano's flaming fountains,<br/>Nor any power above or under<br/>Ever made us mute with wonder.<br/><br/>FIRST VOICE:<br/>But never bowed our snowy crest<br/>As at the voice of thine unrest.<br/><br/>SECOND VOICE:<br/>Never such a sound before<br/>To the Indian waves we bore.<br/>A pilot asleep on the howling sea<br/>Leaped up from the deck in agony,<br/>And heard, and cried, 'Ah, woe is me!'<br/>And died as mad as the wild waves be.<br/><br/>THIRD VOICE:<br/>By such dread words from Earth to Heaven<br/>My still realm was never riven:<br/>When its wound was closed, there stood<br/>Darkness o'er the day like blood.<br/><br/>FOURTH VOICE:<br/>And we shrank back: for dreams of ruin<br/>To frozen caves our flight pursuing<br/>Made us keep silence--thus--and thus--<br/>Though silence is a hell to us.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>The tongueless caverns of the craggy hills<br/>Cried, 'Misery!' then; the hollow Heaven replied,<br/>'Misery!' And the Ocean's purple waves,<br/>Climbing the land, howled to the lashing winds,<br/>And the pale nations heard it, 'Misery!'<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>I hear a sound of voices: not the voice<br/>Which I gave forth. Mother, thy sons and thou<br/>Scorn him, without whose all-enduring will<br/>Beneath the fierce omnipotence of Jove,<br/>Both they and thou had vanished, like thin mist<br/>Unrolled on the morning wind. Know ye not me,<br/>The Titan? He who made his agony<br/>The barrier to your else all-conquering foe?<br/>Oh, rock-embosomed lawns, and snow-fed streams,<br/>Now seen athwart frore vapours, deep below,<br/>Through whose o'ershadowing woods I wandered once<br/>With Asia, drinking life from her loved eyes;<br/>Why scorns the spirit which informs ye, now<br/>To commune with me? me alone, who checked,<br/>As one who checks a fiend-drawn charioteer,<br/>The falsehood and the force of him who reigns<br/>Supreme, and with the groans of pining slaves<br/>Fills your dim glens and liquid wildernesses:<br/>Why answer ye not, still? Brethren!<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>They dare not.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Who dares? for I would hear that curse again.<br/>Ha, what an awful whisper rises up!<br/>'Tis scarce like sound: it tingles through the frame<br/>As lightning tingles, hovering ere it strike.<br/>Speak, Spirit! from thine inorganic voice<br/>I only know that thou art moving near<br/>And love. How cursed I him?<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>How canst thou hear<br/>Who knowest not the language of the dead?<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Thou art a living spirit; speak as they.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>I dare not speak like life, lest Heaven's fell King<br/>Should hear, and link me to some wheel of pain<br/>More torturing than the one whereon I roll.<br/>Subtle thou art and good; and though the Gods<br/>Hear not this voice, yet thou art more than God,<br/>Being wise and kind: earnestly hearken now.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Obscurely through my brain, like shadows dim,<br/>Sweep awful thoughts, rapid and thick. I feel<br/>Faint, like one mingled in entwining love;<br/>Yet 'tis not pleasure.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>No, thou canst not hear:<br/>Thou art immortal, and this tongue is known<br/>Only to those who die.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>And what art thou,<br/>O, melancholy Voice?<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>I am the Earth,<br/>Thy mother; she within whose stony veins,<br/>To the last fibre of the loftiest tree<br/>Whose thin leaves trembled in the frozen air,<br/>Joy ran, as blood within a living frame,<br/>When thou didst from her bosom, like a cloud<br/>Of glory, arise, a spirit of keen joy!<br/>And at thy voice her pining sons uplifted<br/>Their prostrate brows from the polluting dust,<br/>And our almighty Tyrant with fierce dread<br/>Grew pale, until his thunder chained thee here.<br/>Then, see those million worlds which burn and roll<br/>Around us: their inhabitants beheld<br/>My sphered light wane in wide Heaven; the sea<br/>Was lifted by strange tempest, and new fire<br/>From earthquake-rifted mountains of bright snow<br/>Shook its portentous hair beneath Heaven's frown;<br/>Lightning and Inundation vexed the plains;<br/>Blue thistles bloomed in cities; foodless toads<br/>Within voluptuous chambers panting crawled:<br/>When Plague had fallen on man, and beast, and worm,<br/>And Famine; and black blight on herb and tree;<br/>And in the corn, and vines, and meadow-grass,<br/>Teemed ineradicable poisonous weeds<br/>Draining their growth, for my wan breast was dry<br/>With grief; and the thin air, my breath, was stained<br/>With the contagion of a mother's hate<br/>Breathed on her child's destroyer; ay, I heard<br/>Thy curse, the which, if thou rememberest not,<br/>Yet my innumerable seas and streams,<br/>Mountains, and caves, and winds, and yon wide air,<br/>And the inarticulate people of the dead,<br/>Preserve, a treasured spell. We meditate<br/>In secret joy and hope those dreadful words,<br/>But dare not speak them.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Venerable mother!<br/>All else who live and suffer take from thee<br/>Some comfort; flowers, and fruits, and happy sounds,<br/>And love, though fleeting; these may not be mine.<br/>But mine own words, I pray, deny me not.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>They shall be told. Ere Babylon was dust,<br/>The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child,<br/>Met his own image walking in the garden.<br/>That apparition, sole of men, he saw.<br/>For know there are two worlds of life and death:<br/>One that which thou beholdest; but the other<br/>Is underneath the grave, where do inhabit<br/>The shadows of all forms that think and live<br/>Till death unite them and they part no more;<br/>Dreams and the light imaginings of men,<br/>And all that faith creates or love desires,<br/>Terrible, strange, sublime and beauteous shapes.<br/>There thou art, and dost hang, a writhing shade,<br/>'Mid whirlwind-peopled mountains; all the gods<br/>Are there, and all the powers of nameless worlds,<br/>Vast, sceptred phantoms; heroes, men, and beasts;<br/>And Demogorgon, a tremendous gloom;<br/>And he, the supreme Tyrant, on his throne<br/>Of burning gold. Son, one of these shall utter<br/>The curse which all remember. Call at will<br/>Thine own ghost, or the ghost of Jupiter,<br/>Hades or Typhon, or what mightier Gods<br/>From all-prolific Evil, since thy ruin,<br/>Have sprung, and trampled on my prostrate sons.<br/>Ask, and they must reply: so the revenge<br/>Of the Supreme may sweep through vacant shades,<br/>As rainy wind through the abandoned gate<br/>Of a fallen palace.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Mother, let not aught<br/>Of that which may be evil, pass again<br/>My lips, or those of aught resembling me.<br/>Phantasm of Jupiter, arise, appear!<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>My wings are folded o'er mine ears:<br/>My wings are crossed o'er mine eyes:<br/>Yet through their silver shade appears,<br/>And through their lulling plumes arise,<br/>A Shape, a throng of sounds;<br/>May it be no ill to thee<br/>O thou of many wounds!<br/>Near whom, for our sweet sister's sake,<br/>Ever thus we watch and wake.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>The sound is of whirlwind underground,<br/>Earthquake, and fire, and mountains cloven;<br/>The shape is awful like the sound,<br/>Clothed in dark purple, star-inwoven.<br/>A sceptre of pale gold<br/>To stay steps proud, o'er the slow cloud<br/>His veined hand doth hold.<br/>Cruel he looks, but calm and strong,<br/>Like one who does, not suffers wrong.<br/><br/>PHANTASM OF JUPITER:<br/>Why have the secret powers of this strange world<br/>Driven me, a frail and empty phantom, hither<br/>On direst storms? What unaccustomed sounds<br/>Are hovering on my lips, unlike the voice<br/>With which our pallid race hold ghastly talk<br/>In darkness? And, proud sufferer, who art thou?<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Tremendous Image, as thou art must be<br/>He whom thou shadowest forth. I am his foe,<br/>The Titan. Speak the words which I would hear,<br/>Although no thought inform thine empty voice.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>Listen! And though your echoes must be mute,<br/>Grey mountains, and old woods, and haunted springs,<br/>Prophetic caves, and isle-surrounding streams,<br/>Rejoice to hear what yet ye cannot speak.<br/><br/>PHANTASM:<br/>A spirit seizes me and speaks within:<br/>It tears me as fire tears a thunder-cloud.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>See, how he lifts his mighty looks, the Heaven<br/>Darkens above.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>He speaks! O shelter me!<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>I see the curse on gestures proud and cold,<br/>And looks of firm defiance, and calm hate,<br/>And such despair as mocks itself with smiles,<br/>Written as on a scroll: yet speak! Oh, speak!<br/><br/>PHANTASM:<br/>Fiend, I defy thee! with a calm, fixed mind,<br/>All that thou canst inflict I bid thee do;<br/>Foul Tyrant both of Gods and Humankind,<br/>One only being shalt thou not subdue.<br/>Rain then thy plagues upon me here,<br/>Ghastly disease, and frenzying fear;<br/>And let alternate frost and fire<br/>Eat into me, and be thine ire<br/>Lightning, and cutting hail, and legioned forms<br/>Of furies, driving by upon the wounding storms.<br/><br/>Ay, do thy worst. Thou art omnipotent.<br/>O'er all things but thyself I gave thee power,<br/>And my own will. Be thy swift mischiefs sent<br/>To blast mankind, from yon ethereal tower.<br/>Let thy malignant spirit move<br/>In darkness over those I love:<br/>On me and mine I imprecate<br/>The utmost torture of thy hate;<br/>And thus devote to sleepless agony,<br/>This undeclining head while thou must reign on high.<br/><br/>But thou, who art the God and Lord: O, thou,<br/>Who fillest with thy soul this world of woe,<br/>To whom all things of Earth and Heaven do bow<br/>In fear and worship: all-prevailing foe!<br/>I curse thee! let a sufferer's curse<br/>Clasp thee, his torturer, like remorse;<br/>Till thine Infinity shall be<br/>A robe of envenomed agony;<br/>And thine Omnipotence a crown of pain,<br/>To cling like burning gold round thy dissolving brain.<br/><br/>Heap on thy soul, by virtue of this Curse,<br/>Ill deeds, then be thou damned, beholding good;<br/>Both infinite as is the universe,<br/>And thou, and thy self-torturing solitude.<br/>An awful image of calm power<br/>Though now thou sittest, let the hour<br/>Come, when thou must appear to be<br/>That which thou art internally;<br/>And after many a false and fruitless crime<br/>Scorn track thy lagging fall through boundless space and time.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Were these my words, O Parent?<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>They were thine.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>It doth repent me: words are quick and vain;<br/>Grief for awhile is blind, and so was mine.<br/>I wish no living thing to suffer pain.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>Misery, Oh misery to me,<br/>That Jove at length should vanquish thee.<br/>Wail, howl aloud, Land and Sea,<br/>The Earth's rent heart shall answer ye.<br/>Howl, Spirits of the living and the dead,<br/>Your refuge, your defence, lies fallen and vanquished.<br/><br/>FIRST ECHO:<br/>Lies fallen and vanquished!<br/><br/>SECOND ECHO:<br/>Fallen and vanquished!<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Fear not: 'tis but some passing spasm,<br/>The Titan is unvanquished still.<br/>But see, where through the azure chasm<br/>Of yon forked and snowy hill<br/>Trampling the slant winds on high<br/>With golden-sandalled feet, that glow<br/>Under plumes of purple dye,<br/>Like rose-ensanguined ivory,<br/>A Shape comes now,<br/>Stretching on high from his right hand<br/>A serpent-cinctured wand.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>'Tis Jove's world-wandering herald, Mercury.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>And who are those with hydra tresses<br/>And iron wings that climb the wind,<br/>Whom the frowning God represses<br/>Like vapours steaming up behind,<br/>Clanging loud, an endless crowd--<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>These are Jove's tempest-walking hounds,<br/>Whom he gluts with groans and blood,<br/>When charioted on sulphurous cloud<br/>He bursts Heaven's bounds.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Are they now led, from the thin dead<br/>On new pangs to be fed?<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>The Titan looks as ever, firm, not proud.<br/><br/>FIRST FURY:<br/>Ha! I scent life!<br/><br/>SECOND FURY:<br/>Let me but look into his eyes!<br/><br/>THIRD FURY:<br/>The hope of torturing him smells like a heap<br/>Of corpses, to a death-bird after battle.<br/><br/>FIRST FURY:<br/>Darest thou delay, O Herald! take cheer, Hounds<br/>Of Hell: what if the Son of Maia soon<br/>Should make us food and sport--who can please long<br/>The Omnipotent?<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>Back to your towers of iron,<br/>And gnash, beside the streams of fire and wail,<br/>Your foodless teeth. Geryon, arise! and Gorgon,<br/>Chimaera, and thou Sphinx, subtlest of fiends<br/>Who ministered to Thebes Heaven's poisoned wine,<br/>Unnatural love, and more unnatural hate:<br/>These shall perform your task.<br/><br/>FIRST FURY:<br/>Oh, mercy! mercy!<br/>We die with our desire: drive us not back!<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>Crouch then in silence.<br/>Awful Sufferer!<br/>To thee unwilling, most unwillingly<br/>I come, by the great Father's will driven down,<br/>To execute a doom of new revenge.<br/>Alas! I pity thee, and hate myself<br/>That I can do no more: aye from thy sight<br/>Returning, for a season, Heaven seems Hell,<br/>So thy worn form pursues me night and day,<br/>Smiling reproach. Wise art thou, firm and good,<br/>But vainly wouldst stand forth alone in strife<br/>Against the Omnipotent; as yon clear lamps<br/>That measure and divide the weary years<br/>From which there is no refuge, long have taught<br/>And long must teach. Even now thy Torturer arms<br/>With the strange might of unimagined pains<br/>The powers who scheme slow agonies in Hell,<br/>And my commission is to lead them here,<br/>Or what more subtle, foul, or savage fiends<br/>People the abyss, and leave them to their task.<br/>Be it not so! there is a secret known<br/>To thee, and to none else of living things,<br/>Which may transfer the sceptre of wide Heaven,<br/>The fear of which perplexes the Supreme:<br/>Clothe it in words, and bid it clasp his throne<br/>In intercession; bend thy soul in prayer,<br/>And like a suppliant in some gorgeous fane,<br/>Let the will kneel within thy haughty heart:<br/>For benefits and meek submission tame<br/>The fiercest and the mightiest.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Evil minds<br/>Change good to their own nature. I gave all<br/>He has; and in return he chains me here<br/>Years, ages, night and day: whether the Sun<br/>Split my parched skin, or in the moony night<br/>The crystal-winged snow cling round my hair:<br/>Whilst my beloved race is trampled down<br/>By his thought-executing ministers.<br/>Such is the tyrant's recompense: 'tis just:<br/>He who is evil can receive no good;<br/>And for a world bestowed, or a friend lost,<br/>He can feel hate, fear, shame; not gratitude:<br/>He but requites me for his own misdeed.<br/>Kindness to such is keen reproach, which breaks<br/>With bitter stings the light sleep of Revenge.<br/>Submission, thou dost know I cannot try:<br/>For what submission but that fatal word,<br/>The death-seal of mankind's captivity,<br/>Like the Sicilian's hair-suspended sword,<br/>Which trembles o'er his crown, would he accept,<br/>Or could I yield? Which yet I will not yield.<br/>Let others flatter Crime, where it sits throned<br/>In brief Omnipotence: secure are they:<br/>For Justice, when triumphant, will weep down<br/>Pity, not punishment, on her own wrongs,<br/>Too much avenged by those who err. I wait,<br/>Enduring thus, the retributive hour<br/>Which since we spake is even nearer now.<br/>But hark, the hell-hounds clamour: fear delay:<br/>Behold! Heaven lowers under thy Father's frown.<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>Oh, that we might be spared; I to inflict<br/>And thou to suffer! Once more answer me:<br/>Thou knowest not the period of Jove's power?<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>I know but this, that it must come.<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>Alas!<br/>Thou canst not count thy years to come of pain?<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>They last while Jove must reign: nor more, nor less<br/>Do I desire or fear.<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>Yet pause, and plunge<br/>Into Eternity, where recorded time,<br/>Even all that we imagine, age on age,<br/>Seems but a point, and the reluctant mind<br/>Flags wearily in its unending flight,<br/>Till it sink, dizzy, blind, lost, shelterless;<br/>Perchance it has not numbered the slow years<br/>Which thou must spend in torture, unreprieved?<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Perchance no thought can count them, yet they pass.<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>If thou might'st dwell among the Gods the while<br/>Lapped in voluptuous joy?<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>I would not quit<br/>This bleak ravine, these unrepentant pains.<br/><br/>MERCURY:<br/>Alas! I wonder at, yet pity thee.<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>Pity the self-despising slaves of Heaven,<br/>Not me, within whose mind sits peace serene.<br/>As light in the sun, throned: how vain is talk!<br/>Call up the fiends.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>O, sister, look!

There was the Heaven and Earth at first,<br/>And Light and Love; then Saturn, from whose throne<br/>Time fell, an envious shadow: such the state<br/>Of the earth's primal spirits beneath his sway,<br/>As the calm joy of flowers and living leaves<br/>Before the wind or sun has withered them<br/>And semivital worms; but he refused<br/>The birthright of their being, knowledge, power,<br/>The skill which wields the elements, the thought<br/>Which pierces this dim universe like light,<br/>Self-empire, and the majesty of love;<br/>For thirst of which they fainted. Then Prometheus<br/>Gave wisdom, which is strength, to Jupiter,<br/>And with this law alone, 'Let man be free,'<br/>Clothed him with the dominion of wide Heaven.<br/>To know nor faith, nor love, nor law; to be<br/>Omnipotent but friendless is to reign;<br/>And Jove now reigned; for on the race of man<br/>First famine, and then toil, and then disease,<br/>Strife, wounds, and ghastly death unseen before,<br/>Fell; and the unseasonable seasons drove<br/>With alternating shafts of frost and fire,<br/>Their shelterless, pale tribes to mountain caves:<br/>And in their desert hearts fierce wants he sent,<br/>And mad disquietudes, and shadows idle<br/>Of unreal good, which levied mutual war,<br/>So ruining the lair wherein they raged.<br/>Prometheus saw, and waked the legioned hopes<br/>Which sleep within folded Elysian flowers,<br/>Nepenthe, Moly, Amaranth, fadeless blooms,<br/>That they might hide with thin and rainbow wings<br/>The shape of Death; and Love he sent to bind<br/>The disunited tendrils of that vine<br/>Which bears the wine of life, the human heart;<br/>And he tamed fire which, like some beast of prey,<br/>Most terrible, but lovely, played beneath<br/>The frown of man; and tortured to his will<br/>Iron and gold, the slaves and signs of power,<br/>And gems and poisons, and all subtlest forms<br/>Hidden beneath the mountains and the waves.<br/>He gave man speech, and speech created thought,<br/>Which is the measure of the universe;<br/>And Science struck the thrones of earth and heaven,<br/>Which shook, but fell not; and the harmonious mind<br/>Poured itself forth in all-prophetic song;<br/>And music lifted up the listening spirit<br/>Until it walked, exempt from mortal care,<br/>Godlike, o'er the clear billows of sweet sound;<br/>And human hands first mimicked and then mocked,<br/>With moulded limbs more lovely than its own,<br/>The human form, till marble grew divine;<br/>And mothers, gazing, drank the love men see<br/>Reflected in their race, behold, and perish.<br/>He told the hidden power of herbs and springs,<br/>And Disease drank and slept. Death grew like sleep.<br/>He taught the implicated orbits woven<br/>Of the wide-wandering stars; and how the sun<br/>Changes his lair, and by what secret spell<br/>The pale moon is transformed, when her broad eye<br/>Gazes not on the interlunar sea:<br/>He taught to rule, as life directs the limbs,<br/>The tempest-winged chariots of the Ocean,<br/>And the Celt knew the Indian. Cities then<br/>Were built, and through their snow-like columns flowed<br/>The warm winds, and the azure ether shone,<br/>And the blue sea and shadowy hills were seen.<br/>Such, the alleviations of his state,<br/>Prometheus gave to man, for which he hangs<br/>Withering in destined pain: but who rains down<br/>Evil, the immedicable plague, which, while<br/>Man looks on his creation like a God<br/>And sees that it is glorious, drives him on,<br/>The wreck of his own will, the scorn of earth,<br/>The outcast, the abandoned, the alone?<br/>Not Jove: while yet his frown shook Heaven ay, when<br/>His adversary from adamantine chains<br/>Cursed him, he trembled like a slave. Declare<br/>Who is his master? Is he too a slave?<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>All spirits are enslaved which serve things evil:<br/>Thou knowest if Jupiter be such or no.<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>Whom calledst thou God?<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>I spoke but as ye speak,<br/>For Jove is the supreme of living things.<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>Who is the master of the slave?<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>If the abysm<br/>Could vomit forth its secrets...But a voice<br/>Is wanting, the deep truth is imageless;<br/>For what would it avail to bid thee gaze<br/>On the revolving world? What to bid speak<br/>Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance and Change? To these<br/>All things are subject but eternal Love.<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>So much I asked before, and my heart gave<br/>The response thou hast given; and of such truths<br/>Each to itself must be the oracle.<br/>One more demand; and do thou answer me<br/>As my own soul would answer, did it know<br/>That which I ask. Prometheus shall arise<br/>Henceforth the sun of this rejoicing world:<br/>When shall the destined hour arrive?<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Behold!<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>The rocks are cloven, and through the purple night<br/>I see cars drawn by rainbow-winged steeds<br/>Which trample the dim winds: in each there stands<br/>A wild-eyed charioteer urging their flight.<br/>Some look behind, as fiends pursued them there,<br/>And yet I see no shapes but the keen stars:<br/>Others, with burning eyes, lean forth, and drink<br/>With eager lips the wind of their own speed,<br/>As if the thing they loved fled on before,<br/>And now, even now, they clasped it. Their bright locks<br/>Stream like a comet's flashing hair; they all<br/>Sweep onward.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>These are the immortal Hours,<br/>Of whom thou didst demand. One waits for thee.<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>A Spirit with a dreadful countenance<br/>Checks its dark chariot by the craggy gulf.<br/>Unlike thy brethren, ghastly charioteer,<br/>Who art thou? Whither wouldst thou bear me?

Apollo<br/>Is held in heaven by wonder; and the light<br/>Which fills this vapour, as the aereal hue<br/>Of fountain-gazing roses fills the water,<br/>Flows from thy mighty sister.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>Yes, I feel--<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>What is it with thee, sister? Thou art pale.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>How thou art changed! I dare not look on thee;<br/>I feel but see thee not. I scarce endure<br/>The radiance of thy beauty. Some good change<br/>Is working in the elements, which suffer<br/>Thy presence thus unveiled. The Nereids tell<br/>That on the day when the clear hyaline<br/>Was cloven at thine uprise, and thou didst stand<br/>Within a veined shell, which floated on<br/>Over the calm floor of the crystal sea,<br/>Among the Aegean isles, and by the shores<br/>Which bear thy name; love, like the atmosphere<br/>Of the sun's fire filling the living world,<br/>Burst from thee, and illumined earth and heaven<br/>And the deep ocean and the sunless caves<br/>And all that dwells within them; till grief cast<br/>Eclipse upon the soul from which it came:<br/>Such art thou now; nor is it I alone,<br/>Thy sister, thy companion, thine own chosen one,<br/>But the whole world which seeks thy sympathy.<br/>Hearest thou not sounds i' the air which speak the love<br/>Of all articulate beings?

There is a cavern where my spirit<br/>Was panted forth in anguish whilst thy pain<br/>Made my heart mad, and those who did inhale it<br/>Became mad too, and built a temple there,<br/>And spoke, and were oracular, and lured<br/>The erring nations round to mutual war,<br/>And faithless faith, such as Jove kept with thee;<br/>Which breath now rises, as amongst tall weeds<br/>A violet's exhalation, and it fills<br/>With a serener light and crimson air<br/>Intense, yet soft, the rocks and woods around;<br/>It feeds the quick growth of the serpent vine,<br/>And the dark linked ivy tangling wild,<br/>And budding, blown, or odour-faded blooms<br/>Which star the winds with points of coloured light,<br/>As they rain through them, and bright golden globes<br/>Of fruit, suspended in their own green heaven,<br/>And through their veined leaves and amber stems<br/>The flowers whose purple and translucid bowls<br/>Stand ever mantling with aereal dew,<br/>The drink of spirits: and it circles round,<br/>Like the soft waving wings of noonday dreams,<br/>Inspiring calm and happy thoughts, like mine,<br/>Now thou art thus restored. This cave is thine.<br/>Arise! Appear!<br/>[A SPIRIT RISES IN THE LIKENESS OF A WINGED CHILD.]<br/>This is my torch-bearer;<br/>Who let his lamp out in old time with gazing<br/>On eyes from which he kindled it anew<br/>With love, which is as fire, sweet daughter mine,<br/>For such is that within thine own. Run, wayward,<br/>And guide this company beyond the peak<br/>Of Bacchic Nysa, Maenad-haunted mountain,<br/>And beyond Indus and its tribute rivers,<br/>Trampling the torrent streams and glassy lakes<br/>With feet unwet, unwearied, undelaying,<br/>And up the green ravine, across the vale,<br/>Beside the windless and crystalline pool,<br/>Where ever lies, on unerasing waves,<br/>The image of a temple, built above,<br/>Distinct with column, arch, and architrave,<br/>And palm-like capital, and over-wrought,<br/>And populous with most living imagery,<br/>Praxitelean shapes, whose marble smiles<br/>Fill the hushed air with everlasting love.<br/>It is deserted now, but once it bore<br/>Thy name, Prometheus; there the emulous youths<br/>Bore to thy honour through the divine gloom<br/>The lamp which was thine emblem; even as those<br/>Who bear the untransmitted torch of hope<br/>Into the grave, across the night of life,<br/>As thou hast borne it most triumphantly<br/>To this far goal of Time. Depart, farewell.<br/>Beside that temple is the destined cave.<br/><br/>SCENE 3.4:<br/>A FOREST. IN THE BACKGROUND A CAVE.<br/>PROMETHEUS, ASIA, PANTHEA, IONE, AND THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Sister, it is not earthly: how it glides<br/>Under the leaves! how on its head there burns<br/>A light, like a green star, whose emerald beams<br/>Are twined with its fair hair! how, as it moves,<br/>The splendour drops in flakes upon the grass!<br/>Knowest thou it?<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>It is the delicate spirit<br/>That guides the earth through heaven. From afar<br/>The populous constellations call that light<br/>The loveliest of the planets; and sometimes<br/>It floats along the spray of the salt sea,<br/>Or makes its chariot of a foggy cloud,<br/>Or walks through fields or cities while men sleep,<br/>Or o'er the mountain tops, or down the rivers,<br/>Or through the green waste wilderness, as now,<br/>Wondering at all it sees. Before Jove reigned<br/>It loved our sister Asia, and it came<br/>Each leisure hour to drink the liquid light<br/>Out of her eyes, for which it said it thirsted<br/>As one bit by a dipsas, and with her<br/>It made its childish confidence, and told her<br/>All it had known or seen, for it saw much,<br/>Yet idly reasoned what it saw; and called her--<br/>For whence it sprung it knew not, nor do I--<br/>Mother, dear mother.<br/><br/>THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH [RUNNING TO ASIA]:<br/>Mother, dearest mother;<br/>May I then talk with thee as I was wont?<br/>May I then hide my eyes in thy soft arms,<br/>After thy looks have made them tired of joy?<br/>May I then play beside thee the long noons,<br/>When work is none in the bright silent air?<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>I love thee, gentlest being, and henceforth<br/>Can cherish thee unenvied: speak, I pray:<br/>Thy simple talk once solaced, now delights.<br/><br/>SPIRIT OF THE EARTH:<br/>Mother, I am grown wiser, though a child<br/>Cannot be wise like thee, within this day;<br/>And happier too; happier and wiser both.<br/>Thou knowest that toads, and snakes, and loathly worms,<br/>And venomous and malicious beasts, and boughs<br/>That bore ill berries in the woods, were ever<br/>An hindrance to my walks o'er the green world:<br/>And that, among the haunts of humankind,<br/>Hard-featured men, or with proud, angry looks,<br/>Or cold, staid gait, or false and hollow smiles,<br/>Or the dull sneer of self-loved ignorance,<br/>Or other such foul masks, with which ill thoughts<br/>Hide that fair being whom we spirits call man;<br/>And women too, ugliest of all things evil,<br/>(Though fair, even in a world where thou art fair,<br/>When good and kind, free and sincere like thee)<br/>When false or frowning made me sick at heart<br/>To pass them, though they slept, and I unseen.<br/>Well, my path lately lay through a great city<br/>Into the woody hills surrounding it:<br/>A sentinel was sleeping at the gate:<br/>When there was heard a sound, so loud, it shook<br/>The towers amid the moonlight, yet more sweet<br/>Than any voice but thine, sweetest of all;<br/>A long, long sound, as it would never end:<br/>And all the inhabitants leaped suddenly<br/>Out of their rest, and gathered in the streets,<br/>Looking in wonder up to Heaven, while yet<br/>The music pealed along. I hid myself<br/>Within a fountain in the public square,<br/>Where I lay like the reflex of the moon<br/>Seen in a wave under green leaves; and soon<br/>Those ugly human shapes and visages<br/>Of which I spoke as having wrought me pain,<br/>Passed floating through the air, and fading still<br/>Into the winds that scattered them; and those<br/>From whom they passed seemed mild and lovely forms<br/>After some foul disguise had fallen, and all<br/>Were somewhat changed, and after brief surprise<br/>And greetings of delighted wonder, all<br/>Went to their sleep again: and when the dawn<br/>Came, wouldst thou think that toads, and snakes, and efts,<br/>Could e'er be beautiful? yet so they were,<br/>And that with little change of shape or hue:<br/>All things had put their evil nature off:<br/>I cannot tell my joy, when o'er a lake,<br/>Upon a drooping bough with nightshade twined,<br/>I saw two azure halcyons clinging downward<br/>And thinning one bright bunch of amber berries,<br/>With quick long beaks, and in the deep there lay<br/>Those lovely forms imaged as in a sky;<br/>So, with my thoughts full of these happy changes,<br/>We meet again, the happiest change of all.<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>And never will we part, till thy chaste sister<br/>Who guides the frozen and inconstant moon<br/>Will look on thy more warm and equal light<br/>Till her heart thaw like flakes of April snow<br/>And love thee.<br/><br/>SPIRIT OF THE EARTH:<br/>What! as Asia loves Prometheus?<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>Peace, wanton, thou art yet not old enough.<br/>Think ye by gazing on each other's eyes<br/>To multiply your lovely selves, and fill<br/>With sphered fires the interlunar air?<br/><br/>SPIRIT OF THE EARTH:<br/>Nay, mother, while my sister trims her lamp<br/>'Tis hard I should go darkling.<br/><br/>ASIA:<br/>Listen; look!<br/><br/>[THE SPIRIT OF THE HOUR ENTERS.]<br/><br/>PROMETHEUS:<br/>We feel what thou hast heard and seen: yet speak.<br/><br/>SPIRIT OF THE HOUR:<br/>Soon as the sound had ceased whose thunder filled<br/>The abysses of the sky and the wide earth,<br/>There was a change: the impalpable thin air<br/>And the all-circling sunlight were transformed,<br/>As if the sense of love dissolved in them<br/>Had folded itself round the sphered world.<br/>My vision then grew clear, and I could see<br/>Into the mysteries of the universe:<br/>Dizzy as with delight I floated down,<br/>Winnowing the lightsome air with languid plumes,<br/>My coursers sought their birthplace in the sun,<br/>Where they henceforth will live exempt from toil,<br/>Pasturing flowers of vegetable fire;<br/>And where my moonlike car will stand within<br/>A temple, gazed upon by Phidian forms<br/>Of thee, and Asia, and the Earth, and me,<br/>And you fair nymphs looking the love we feel,--<br/>In memory of the tidings it has borne,--<br/>Beneath a dome fretted with graven flowers,<br/>Poised on twelve columns of resplendent stone,<br/>And open to the bright and liquid sky.<br/>Yoked to it by an amphisbaenic snake<br/>The likeness of those winged steeds will mock<br/>The flight from which they find repose. Alas,<br/>Whither has wandered now my partial tongue<br/>When all remains untold which ye would hear?<br/>As I have said, I floated to the earth:<br/>It was, as it is still, the pain of bliss<br/>To move, to breathe, to be. I wandering went<br/>Among the haunts and dwellings of mankind,<br/>And first was disappointed not to see<br/>Such mighty change as I had felt within<br/>Expressed in outward things; but soon I looked,<br/>And behold, thrones were kingless, and men walked<br/>One with the other even as spirits do,<br/>None fawned, none trampled; hate, disdain, or fear,<br/>Self-love or self-contempt, on human brows<br/>No more inscribed, as o'er the gate of hell,<br/>'All hope abandon ye who enter here;'<br/>None frowned, none trembled, none with eager fear<br/>Gazed on another's eye of cold command,<br/>Until the subject of a tyrant's will<br/>Became, worse fate, the abject of his own,<br/>Which spurred him, like an outspent horse, to death.<br/>None wrought his lips in truth-entangling lines<br/>Which smiled the lie his tongue disdained to speak;<br/>None, with firm sneer, trod out in his own heart<br/>The sparks of love and hope till there remained<br/>Those bitter ashes, a soul self-consumed,<br/>And the wretch crept a vampire among men,<br/>Infecting all with his own hideous ill;<br/>None talked that common, false, cold, hollow talk<br/>Which makes the heart deny the "yes" it breathes,<br/>Yet question that unmeant hypocrisy<br/>With such a self-mistrust as has no name.<br/>And women, too, frank, beautiful, and kind<br/>As the free heaven which rains fresh light and dew<br/>On the wide earth, past; gentle radiant forms,<br/>From custom's evil taint exempt and pure;<br/>Speaking the wisdom once they could not think,<br/>Looking emotions once they feared to feel,<br/>And changed to all which once they dared not be,<br/>Yet being now, made earth like heaven; nor pride,<br/>Nor jealousy, nor envy, nor ill shame,<br/>The bitterest of those drops of treasured gall,<br/>Spoiled the sweet taste of the nepenthe, love.<br/><br/>Thrones, altars, judgement-seats, and prisons; wherein,<br/>And beside which, by wretched men were borne<br/>Sceptres, tiaras, swords, and chains, and tomes<br/>Of reasoned wrong, glozed on by ignorance,<br/>Were like those monstrous and barbaric shapes,<br/>The ghosts of a no-more-remembered fame,<br/>Which, from their unworn obelisks, look forth<br/>In triumph o'er the palaces and tombs<br/>Of those who were their conquerors: mouldering round,<br/>These imaged to the pride of kings and priests<br/>A dark yet mighty faith, a power as wide<br/>As is the world it wasted, and are now<br/>But an astonishment; even so the tools<br/>And emblems of its last captivity,<br/>Amid the dwellings of the peopled earth,<br/>Stand, not o'erthrown, but unregarded now.<br/>And those foul shapes, abhorred by god and man,--<br/>Which, under many a name and many a form<br/>Strange, savage, ghastly, dark and execrable,<br/>Were Jupiter, the tyrant of the world;<br/>And which the nations, panic-stricken, served<br/>With blood, and hearts broken by long hope, and love<br/>Dragged to his altars soiled and garlandless,<br/>And slain among men's unreclaiming tears,<br/>Flattering the thing they feared, which fear was hate,--<br/>Frown, mouldering fast, o'er their abandoned shrines:<br/>The painted veil, by those who were, called life,<br/>Which mimicked, as with colours idly spread,<br/>All men believed and hoped, is torn aside;<br/>The loathsome mask has fallen, the man remains<br/>Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed, but man<br/>Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless,<br/>Exempt from awe, worship, degree, the king<br/>Over himself; just, gentle, wise; but man<br/>Passionless?--no, yet free from guilt or pain,<br/>Which were, for his will made or suffered them,<br/>Nor yet exempt, though ruling them like slaves,<br/>From chance, and death, and mutability,<br/>The clogs of that which else might oversoar<br/>The loftiest star of unascended heaven,<br/>Pinnacled dim in the intense inane.<br/><br/>END OF ACT 3.<br/><br/>ACT 4.<br/><br/>SCENE 4.1:<br/>A PART OF THE FOREST NEAR THE

appear<br/>From its chaos made calm by love, not fear.<br/><br/>SEMICHORUS 2:<br/>We encircle the ocean and mountains of earth,<br/>And the happy forms of its death and birth<br/>Change to the music of our sweet mirth.<br/><br/>CHORUS OF HOURS AND SPIRITS:<br/>Break the dance, and scatter the song;<br/>Let some depart, and some remain,<br/>Wherever we fly we lead along<br/>In leashes, like starbeams, soft yet strong,<br/>The clouds that are heavy with love's sweet rain.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>Ha! they are gone!<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Yet feel you no delight<br/>From the past sweetness?<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>As the bare green hill<br/>When some soft cloud vanishes into rain,<br/>Laughs with a thousand drops of sunny water<br/>To the unpavilioned sky!<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Even whilst we speak<br/>New notes arise. What is that awful sound?<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>'Tis the deep music of the rolling world<br/>Kindling within the strings of the waved air<br/>Aeolian modulations.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Listen too,<br/>How every pause is filled with under-notes,<br/>Clear, silver, icy, keen awakening tones,<br/>Which pierce the sense, and live within the soul,<br/>As the sharp stars pierce winter's crystal air<br/>And gaze upon themselves within the sea.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>But see where through two openings in the forest<br/>Which hanging branches overcanopy,<br/>And where two runnels of a rivulet,<br/>Between the close moss violet-inwoven,<br/>Have made their path of melody, like sisters<br/>Who part with sighs that they may meet in smiles,<br/>Turning their dear disunion to an isle<br/>Of lovely grief, a wood of sweet sad thoughts;<br/>Two visions of strange radiance float upon<br/>The ocean-like enchantment of strong sound,<br/>Which flows intenser, keener, deeper yet<br/>Under the ground and through the windless air.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>I see a chariot like that thinnest boat,<br/>In which the Mother of the Months is borne<br/>By ebbing light into her western cave,<br/>When she upsprings from interlunar dreams;<br/>O'er which is curved an orblike canopy<br/>Of gentle darkness, and the hills and woods,<br/>Distinctly seen through that dusk aery veil,<br/>Regard like shapes in an enchanter's glass;<br/>Its wheels are solid clouds, azure and gold,<br/>Such as the genii of the thunderstorm<br/>Pile on the floor of the illumined sea<br/>When the sun rushes under it; they roll<br/>And move and grow as with an inward wind;<br/>Within it sits a winged infant, white<br/>Its countenance, like the whiteness of bright snow,<br/>Its plumes are as feathers of sunny frost,<br/>Its limbs gleam white, through the wind-flowing folds<br/>Of its white robe, woof of ethereal pearl.<br/>Its hair is white, the brightness of white light<br/>Scattered in strings; yet its two eyes are heavens<br/>Of liquid darkness, which the Deity<br/>Within seems pouring, as a storm is poured<br/>From jagged clouds, out of their arrowy lashes,<br/>Tempering the cold and radiant air around,<br/>With fire that is not brightness; in its hand<br/>It sways a quivering moonbeam, from whose point<br/>A guiding power directs the chariot's prow<br/>Over its wheeled clouds, which as they roll<br/>Over the grass, and flowers, and waves, wake sounds,<br/>Sweet as a singing rain of silver dew.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>And from the other opening in the wood<br/>Rushes, with loud and whirlwind harmony,<br/>A sphere, which is as many thousand spheres,<br/>Solid as crystal, yet through all its mass<br/>Flow, as through empty space, music and light:<br/>Ten thousand orbs involving and involved,<br/>Purple and azure, white, and green, and golden,<br/>Sphere within sphere; and every space between<br/>Peopled with unimaginable shapes,<br/>Such as ghosts dream dwell in the lampless deep,<br/>Yet each inter-transpicuous, and they whirl<br/>Over each other with a thousand motions,<br/>Upon a thousand sightless axles spinning,<br/>And with the force of self-destroying swiftness,<br/>Intensely, slowly, solemnly, roll on,<br/>Kindling with mingled sounds, and many tones,<br/>Intelligible words and music wild.<br/>With mighty whirl the multitudinous orb<br/>Grinds the bright brook into an azure mist<br/>Of elemental subtlety, like light;<br/>And the wild odour of the forest flowers,<br/>The music of the living grass and air,<br/>The emerald light of leaf-entangled beams<br/>Round its intense yet self-conflicting speed,<br/>Seem kneaded into one aereal mass<br/>Which drowns the sense. Within the orb itself,<br/>Pillowed upon its alabaster arms,<br/>Like to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil,<br/>On its own folded wings, and wavy hair,<br/>The Spirit of the Earth is laid asleep,<br/>And you can see its little lips are moving,<br/>Amid the changing light of their own smiles,<br/>Like one who talks of what he loves in dream.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>'Tis only mocking the orb's harmony.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>And from a star upon its forehead, shoot,<br/>Like swords of azure fire, or golden spears<br/>With tyrant-quelling myrtle overtwined,<br/>Embleming heaven and earth united now,<br/>Vast beams like spokes of some invisible wheel<br/>Which whirl as the orb whirls, swifter than thought,<br/>Filling the abyss with sun-like lightenings,<br/>And perpendicular now, and now transverse,<br/>Pierce the dark soil, and as they pierce and pass,<br/>Make bare the secrets of the earth's deep heart;<br/>Infinite mine of adamant and gold,<br/>Valueless stones, and unimagined gems,<br/>And caverns on crystalline columns poised<br/>With vegetable silver overspread;<br/>Wells of unfathomed fire, and water springs<br/>Whence the great sea, even as a child is fed,<br/>Whose vapours clothe earth's monarch mountain-tops<br/>With kingly, ermine snow. The beams flash on<br/>And make appear the melancholy ruins<br/>Of cancelled cycles; anchors, beaks of ships;<br/>Planks turned to marble; quivers, helms, and spears,<br/>And gorgon-headed targes, and the wheels<br/>Of scythed chariots, and the emblazonry<br/>Of trophies, standards, and armorial beasts,<br/>Round which death laughed, sepulchred emblems<br/>Of dead destruction, ruin within ruin!<br/>The wrecks beside of many a city vast,<br/>Whose population which the earth grew over<br/>Was mortal, but not human; see, they lie,<br/>Their monstrous works, and uncouth skeletons,<br/>Their statues, homes and fanes; prodigious shapes<br/>Huddled in gray annihilation, split,<br/>Jammed in the hard, black deep; and over these,<br/>The anatomies of unknown winged things,<br/>And fishes which were isles of living scale,<br/>And serpents, bony chains, twisted around<br/>The iron crags, or within heaps of dust<br/>To which the tortuous strength of their last pangs<br/>Had crushed the iron crags; and over these<br/>The jagged alligator, and the might<br/>Of earth-convulsing behemoth, which once<br/>Were monarch beasts, and on the slimy shores,<br/>And weed-overgrown continents of earth,<br/>Increased and multiplied like summer worms<br/>On an abandoned corpse, till the blue globe<br/>Wrapped deluge round it like a cloak, and they<br/>Yelled, gasped, and were abolished; or some God<br/>Whose throne was in a comet, passed, and cried,<br/>'Be not!' And like my words they were no more.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>The joy, the triumph, the delight, the madness!<br/>The boundless, overflowing, bursting gladness,<br/>The vaporous exultation not to be confined!<br/>Ha! ha! the animation of delight<br/>Which wraps me, like an atmosphere of light,<br/>And bears me as a cloud is borne by its own wind.<br/><br/>THE MOON:<br/>Brother mine, calm wanderer,<br/>Happy globe of land and air,<br/>Some Spirit is darted like a beam from thee,<br/>Which penetrates my frozen frame,<br/>And passes with the warmth of flame,<br/>With love, and odour, and deep melody<br/>Through me, through me!<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>Ha! ha! the caverns of my hollow mountains,<br/>My cloven fire-crags, sound-exulting fountains<br/>Laugh with a vast and inextinguishable laughter.<br/>The oceans, and the deserts, and the abysses,<br/>And the deep air's unmeasured wildernesses,<br/>Answer from all their clouds and billows, echoing after.<br/><br/>They cry aloud as I do. Sceptred curse,<br/>Who all our green and azure universe<br/>Threatenedst to muffle round with black destruction, sending<br/>A solid cloud to rain hot thunderstones,<br/>And splinter and knead down my children's bones,<br/>All I bring forth, to one void mass battering and blending,--<br/><br/>Until each crag-like tower, and storied column,<br/>Palace, and obelisk, and temple solemn,<br/>My imperial mountains crowned with cloud, and snow, and fire,<br/>My sea-like forests, every blade and blossom<br/>Which finds a grave or cradle in my bosom,<br/>Were stamped by thy strong hate into a lifeless mire:<br/><br/>How art thou sunk, withdrawn, covered, drunk up<br/>By thirsty nothing, as the brackish cup<br/>Drained by a desert-troop, a little drop for all;<br/>And from beneath, around, within, above,<br/>Filling thy void annihilation, love<br/>Bursts in like light on caves cloven by the thunder-ball.<br/><br/>THE MOON:<br/>The snow upon my lifeless mountains<br/>Is loosened into living fountains,<br/>My solid oceans flow, and sing and shine:<br/>A spirit from my heart bursts forth,<br/>It clothes with unexpected birth<br/>My cold bare bosom: Oh! it must be thine<br/>On mine, on mine!<br/><br/>Gazing on thee I feel, I know<br/>Green stalks burst forth, and bright flowers grow,<br/>And living shapes upon my bosom move:<br/>Music is in the sea and air,<br/>Winged clouds soar here and there,<br/>Dark with the rain new buds are dreaming of:<br/>'Tis love, all love!<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>It interpenetrates my granite mass,<br/>Through tangled roots and trodden clay doth pass<br/>Into the utmost leaves and delicatest flowers;<br/>Upon the winds, among the clouds 'tis spread,<br/>It wakes a life in the forgotten dead,<br/>They breathe a spirit up from their obscurest bowers.<br/><br/>And like a storm bursting its cloudy prison<br/>With thunder, and with whirlwind, has arisen<br/>Out of the lampless caves of unimagined being:<br/>With earthquake shock and swiftness making shiver<br/>Thought's stagnant chaos, unremoved for ever,<br/>Till hate, and fear, and pain, light-vanquished shadows, fleeing,<br/><br/>Leave Man, who was a many-sided mirror,<br/>Which could distort to many a shape of error,<br/>This true fair world of things, a sea reflecting love;<br/>Which over all his kind, as the sun's heaven<br/>Gliding o'er ocean, smooth, serene, and even,<br/>Darting from starry depths radiance and life, doth move:<br/><br/>Leave Man, even as a leprous child is left,<br/>Who follows a sick beast to some warm cleft<br/>Of rocks, through which the might of healing springs is poured;<br/>Then when it wanders home with rosy smile,<br/>Unconscious, and its mother fears awhile<br/>It is a spirit, then, weeps on her child restored.<br/><br/>Man, oh, not men! a chain of linked thought,<br/>Of love and might to be divided not,<br/>Compelling the elements with adamantine stress;<br/>As the sun rules, even with a tyrant's gaze,<br/>The unquiet republic of the maze<br/>Of planets, struggling fierce towards heaven's free wilderness.<br/><br/>Man, one harmonious soul of many a soul,<br/>Whose nature is its own divine control,<br/>Where all things flow to all, as rivers to the sea;<br/>Familiar acts are beautiful through love;<br/>Labour, and pain, and grief, in life's green grove<br/>Sport like tame beasts, none knew how gentle they could be!<br/><br/>His will, with all mean passions, bad delights,<br/>And selfish cares, its trembling satellites,<br/>A spirit ill to guide, but mighty to obey,<br/>Is as a tempest-winged ship, whose helm<br/>Love rules, through waves which dare not overwhelm,<br/>Forcing life's wildest shores to own its sovereign sway.<br/><br/>All things confess his strength. Through the cold mass<br/>Of marble and of colour his dreams pass;<br/>Bright threads whence mothers weave the robes their children wear;<br/>Language is a perpetual Orphic song,<br/>Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng<br/>Of thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapeless were.<br/><br/>The lightning is his slave; heaven's utmost deep<br/>Gives up her stars, and like a flock of sheep<br/>They pass before his eye, are numbered, and roll on!<br/>The tempest is his steed, he strides the air;<br/>And the abyss shouts from her depth laid bare,<br/>Heaven, hast thou secrets? Man unveils me; I have none.<br/><br/>THE MOON:<br/>The shadow of white death has passed<br/>From my path in heaven at last,<br/>A clinging shroud of solid frost and sleep;<br/>And through my newly-woven bowers,<br/>Wander happy paramours,<br/>Less mighty, but as mild as those who keep<br/>Thy vales more deep.<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>As the dissolving warmth of dawn may fold<br/>A half unfrozen dew-globe, green, and gold,<br/>And crystalline, till it becomes a winged mist,<br/>And wanders up the vault of the blue day,<br/>Outlives the noon, and on the sun's last ray<br/>Hangs o'er the sea, a fleece of fire and amethyst.<br/><br/>THE MOON:<br/>Thou art folded, thou art lying<br/>In the light which is undying<br/>Of thine own joy, and heaven's smile divine;<br/>All suns and constellations shower<br/>On thee a light, a life, a power<br/>Which doth array thy sphere; thou pourest thine<br/>On mine, on mine!<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>I spin beneath my pyramid of night,<br/>Which points into the heavens dreaming delight,<br/>Murmuring victorious joy in my enchanted sleep;<br/>As a youth lulled in love-dreams faintly sighing,<br/>Under the shadow of his beauty lying,<br/>Which round his rest a watch of light and warmth doth keep.<br/><br/>THE MOON:<br/>As in the soft and sweet eclipse,<br/>When soul meets soul on lovers' lips,<br/>High hearts are calm, and brightest eyes are dull;<br/>So when thy shadow falls on me,<br/>Then am I mute and still, by thee<br/>Covered; of thy love, Orb most beautiful,<br/>Full, oh, too full!<br/><br/>Thou art speeding round the sun<br/>Brightest world of many a one;<br/>Green and azure sphere which shinest<br/>With a light which is divinest<br/>Among all the lamps of Heaven<br/>To whom life and light is given;<br/>I, thy crystal paramour<br/>Borne beside thee by a power<br/>Like the polar Paradise,<br/>Magnet-like of lovers' eyes;<br/>I, a most enamoured maiden<br/>Whose weak brain is overladen<br/>With the pleasure of her love,<br/>Maniac-like around thee move<br/>Gazing, an insatiate bride,<br/>On thy form from every side<br/>Like a Maenad, round the cup<br/>Which Agave lifted up<br/>In the weird Cadmaean forest.<br/>Brother, wheresoe'er thou soarest<br/>I must hurry, whirl and follow<br/>Through the heavens wide and hollow,<br/>Sheltered by the warm embrace<br/>Of thy soul from hungry space,<br/>Drinking from thy sense and sight<br/>Beauty, majesty, and might,<br/>As a lover or a chameleon<br/>Grows like what it looks upon,<br/>As a violet's gentle eye<br/>Gazes on the azure sky<br/>Until its hue grows like what it beholds,<br/>As a gray and watery mist<br/>Glows like solid amethyst<br/>Athwart the western mountain it enfolds,<br/>When the sunset sleeps<br/>Upon its snow--<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>And the weak day weeps<br/>That it should be so.<br/>Oh, gentle Moon, the voice of thy delight<br/>Falls on me like thy clear and tender light<br/>Soothing the seaman, borne the summer night,<br/>Through isles for ever calm;<br/>Oh, gentle Moon, thy crystal accents pierce<br/>The caverns of my pride's deep universe,<br/>Charming the tiger joy, whose tramplings fierce<br/>Made wounds which need thy balm.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>I rise as from a bath of sparkling water,<br/>A bath of azure light, among dark rocks,<br/>Out of the stream of sound.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>Ah me! sweet sister,<br/>The stream of sound has ebbed away from us,<br/>And you pretend to rise out of its wave,<br/>Because your words fall like the clear, soft dew<br/>Shaken from a bathing wood-nymph's limbs and hair.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>Peace! peace! a mighty Power, which is as darkness,<br/>Is rising out of Earth, and from the sky<br/>Is showered like night, and from within the air<br/>Bursts, like eclipse which had been gathered up<br/>Into the pores of sunlight: the bright visions,<br/>Wherein the singing spirits rode and shone,<br/>Gleam like pale meteors through a watery night.<br/><br/>IONE:<br/>There is a sense of words upon mine ear.<br/><br/>PANTHEA:<br/>An universal sound like words: Oh, list!<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Thou, Earth, calm empire of a happy soul,<br/>Sphere of divinest shapes and harmonies,<br/>Beautiful orb! gathering as thou dost roll<br/>The love which paves thy path along the skies:<br/><br/>THE EARTH:<br/>I hear: I am as a drop of dew that dies.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Thou, Moon, which gazest on the nightly Earth<br/>With wonder, as it gazes upon thee;<br/>Whilst each to men, and beasts, and the swift birth<br/>Of birds, is beauty, love, calm, harmony:<br/><br/>THE MOON:<br/>I hear: I am a leaf shaken by thee!<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Ye Kings of suns and stars, Daemons and Gods,<br/>Ethereal Dominations, who possess<br/>Elysian, windless, fortunate abodes<br/>Beyond Heaven's constellated wilderness:<br/><br/>A VOICE FROM ABOVE:<br/>Our great Republic hears: we are blest, and bless.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Ye happy Dead, whom beams of brightest verse<br/>Are clouds to hide, not colours to portray,<br/>Whether your nature is that universe<br/>Which once ye saw and suffered--<br/><br/>A VOICE: FROM BENEATH:<br/>Or as they<br/>Whom we have left, we change and pass away.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Ye elemental Genii, who have homes<br/>From man's high mind even to the central stone<br/>Of sullen lead; from heaven's star-fretted domes<br/>To the dull weed some sea-worm battens on:<br/><br/>A CONFUSED VOICE:<br/>We hear: thy words waken Oblivion.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Spirits, whose homes are flesh; ye beasts and birds,<br/>Ye worms and fish; ye living leaves and buds;<br/>Lightning and wind; and ye untameable herds,<br/>Meteors and mists, which throng air's solitudes:--<br/><br/>A VOICE:<br/>Thy voice to us is wind among still woods.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>Man, who wert once a despot and a slave;<br/>A dupe and a deceiver; a decay;<br/>A traveller from the cradle to the grave<br/>Through the dim night of this immortal day:<br/><br/>ALL:<br/>Speak: thy strong words may never pass away.<br/><br/>DEMOGORGON:<br/>This is the day, which down the void abysm<br/>At the Earth-born's spell yawns for Heaven's despotism,<br/>And Conquest is dragged captive through the deep:<br/>Love, from its awful throne of patient power<br/>In the wise heart, from the last giddy hour<br/>Of dread endurance, from the slippery, steep,<br/>And narrow verge of crag-like agony, springs<br/>And folds over the world its healing wings.<br/><br/>Gentleness, Virtue, Wisdom, and Endurance,<br/>These are the seals of that most firm assurance<br/>Which bars the pit over Destruction's strength;<br/>And if, with infirm hand, Eternity,<br/>Mother of many acts and hours, should free<br/>The serpent that would clasp her with his length;<br/>These are the spells by which to reassume<br/>An empire o'er the disentangled doom.<br/><br/>To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;<br/>To forgive wrongs darker than death or night;<br/>To defy Power, which seems omnipotent;<br/>To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates<br/>From its own wreck the thing it contemplates;<br/>Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent;<br/>This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be<br/>Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free;<br/>This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory!
