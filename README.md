# üíÆ Time's Revenges by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    I've a Friend, over the sea;<br/>I like him, but he loves me.<br/>It all grew out of the books I write;<br/>They find such favour in his sight<br/>That he slaughters you with savage looks<br/>Because you don't admire my books.<br/>He does himself though,--and if some vein<br/>Were to snap tonight in this heavy brain,<br/>To-morrow month, if I lived to try,<br/>Round should I just turn quietly,<br/>Or out of the bedclothes stretch my hand<br/>Till I found him, come from his foreign land<br/>To be my nurse in this poor place,<br/>And make my broth and wash my face<br/>And light my fire and, all the while,<br/>Bear with his old good-humoured smile<br/>That I told him "Better have kept away<br/>Than come and kill me, night and day,<br/>With, worse than fever throbs and shoots,<br/>The creaking of his clumsy boots."<br/>I am as sure that this he would do,<br/>As that Saint Paul's is striking two.<br/>And I think I rather... woe is me!<br/>--Yes, rather would see him than not see,<br/>If lifting a hand could seat him there<br/>Before me in the empty chair<br/>To-night, when my head aches indeed,<br/>And I can neither think nor read<br/>Nor make these purple fingers hold<br/>The pen; this garret's freezing cold!<br/><br/>And I've a Lady--there he wakes,<br/>The laughing fiend and prince of snakes<br/>Within me, at her name, to pray<br/>Fate send some creature in the way<br/>Of my love for her, to be down-torn,<br/>Upthrust and outward-borne,<br/>So I might prove myself that sea<br/>Of passion which I needs must be!<br/>Call my thoughts false and my fancies quaint<br/>And my style infirm and its figures faint,<br/>All the critics say, and more blame yet,<br/>And not one angry word you get.<br/>But, please you, wonder I would put<br/>My cheek beneath that lady's foot<br/>Rather than trample under mine<br/>That laurels of the Florentine,<br/>And you shall see how the devil spends<br/>A fire God gave for other ends!<br/>I tell you, I stride up and down<br/>This garret, crowned with love's best crown,<br/>And feasted with love's perfect feast,<br/>To think I kill for her, at least,<br/>Body and soul and peace and fame,<br/>Alike youth's end and manhood's aim,<br/>--So is my spirit, as flesh with sin,<br/>Filled full, eaten out and in<br/>With the face of her, the eyes of her,<br/>The lips, the little chin, the stir<br/>Of shadow round her mouth; and she<br/>--I'll tell you,--calmly would decree<br/>That I should roast at a slow fire,<br/><br/>If that would compass her desire<br/>And make her one whom they invite<br/>To the famous ball to-morrow night.<br/><br/>There may be heaven; there must be hell;<br/>Meantime, there is our earth here--well!
