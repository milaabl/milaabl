# üíÆ Lara.  by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>The Serfs are glad through Lara's wide domain,<br/>And Slavery half forgets her feudal chain;<br/>He, their unhoped, but unforgotten lord,<br/>The long self-exiled Chieftain, is restored:<br/>There be bright faces in the busy hall,<br/>Bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;<br/>Far checkering o'er the pictured window, plays<br/>The unwonted faggot's hospitable blaze;<br/>And gay retainers gather round the hearth,<br/>With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth.<br/><br/>The Chief of Lara is returned again:<br/>And why had Lara crossed the bounding main?<br/>Left by his Sire, too young such loss to know,<br/>Lord of himself,--that heritage of woe,<br/>That fearful empire which the human breast<br/>But holds to rob the heart within of rest!--<br/>With none to check, and few to point in time<br/>The thousand paths that slope the way to crime;<br/>Then, when he most required commandment, then<br/>Had Lara's daring boyhood governed men.<br/>It skills not, boots not step by step to trace<br/>His youth through all the mazes of its race;<br/>Short was the course his restlessness had run,<br/>But long enough to leave him half undone.<br/><br/>And Lara left in youth his father-land;<br/>But from the hour he waved his parting hand<br/>Each trace waxed fainter of his course, till all<br/>Had nearly ceased his memory to recall.<br/>His sire was dust, his vassals could declare,<br/>'Twas all they knew, that Lara was not there;<br/>Nor sent, nor came he, till conjecture grew<br/>Cold in the many, anxious in the few.<br/>His hall scarce echoes with his wonted name,<br/>His portrait darkens in its fading frame,<br/>Another chief consoled his destined bride,<br/>The young forgot him, and the old had died;<br/>"Yet doth he live!" exclaims the impatient heir,<br/>And sighs for sables which he must not wear.<br/>A hundred scutcheons deck with gloomy grace<br/>The Laras' last and longest dwelling-place;<br/>But one is absent from the mouldering file,<br/>That now were welcome in that Gothic pile.<br/><br/>He comes at last in sudden loneliness,<br/>And whence they know not, why they need not guess;<br/>They more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er<br/>Not that he came, but came not long before:<br/>No train is his beyond a single page,<br/>Of foreign aspect, and of tender age.<br/>Years had rolled on, and fast they speed away<br/>To those that wander as to those that stay;<br/>But lack of tidings from another clime<br/>Had lent a flagging wing to weary Time.<br/>They see, they recognise, yet almost deem<br/>The present dubious, or the past a dream.<br/><br/>He lives, nor yet is past his Manhood's prime,<br/>Though seared by toil, and something touched by Time;<br/>His faults, whate'er they were, if scarce forgot,<br/>Might be untaught him by his varied lot;<br/>Nor good nor ill of late were known, his name<br/>Might yet uphold his patrimonial fame:<br/>His soul in youth was haughty, but his sins<br/>No more than pleasure from the stripling wins;<br/>And such, if not yet hardened in their course,<br/>Might be redeemed, nor ask a long remorse.<br/><br/>And they indeed were changed--'tis quickly seen,<br/>Whate'er he be, 'twas not what he had been:<br/>That brow in furrowed lines had fixed at last,<br/>And spake of passions, but of passion past:<br/>The pride, but not the fire, of early days,<br/>Coldness of mien, and carelessness of praise;<br/>A high demeanour, and a glance that took<br/>Their thoughts from others by a single look;<br/>And that sarcastic levity of tongue,<br/>The stinging of a heart the world hath stung,<br/>That darts in seeming playfulness around,<br/>And makes those feel that will not own the wound;<br/>All these seemed his, and something more beneath<br/>Than glance could well reveal, or accent breathe.<br/>Ambition, Glory, Love, the common aim,<br/>That some can conquer, and that all would claim,<br/>Within his breast appeared no more to strive,<br/>Yet seemed as lately they had been alive;<br/>And some deep feeling it were vain to trace<br/>At moments lightened o'er his livid face.<br/><br/>Not much he loved long question of the past,<br/>Nor told of wondrous wilds, and deserts vast,<br/>In those far lands where he had wandered lone,<br/>And--as himself would have it seem--unknown:<br/>Yet these in vain his eye could scarcely scan,<br/>Nor glean experience from his fellow man;<br/>But what he had beheld he shunned to show,<br/>As hardly worth a stranger's care to know;<br/>If still more prying such inquiry grew,<br/>His brow fell darker, and his words more few.<br/><br/>Not unrejoiced to see him once again,<br/>Warm was his welcome to the haunts of men;<br/>Born of high lineage, linked in high command,<br/>He mingled with the Magnates of his land;<br/>Joined the carousals of the great and gay,<br/>And saw them smile or sigh their hours away;<br/>But still he only saw, and did not share,<br/>The common pleasure or the general care;<br/>He did not follow what they all pursued<br/>With hope still baffled still to be renewed;<br/>Nor shadowy Honour, nor substantial Gain,<br/>Nor Beauty's preference, and the rival's pain:<br/>Around him some mysterious circle thrown<br/>Repelled approach, and showed him still alone;<br/>Upon his eye sat something of reproof,<br/>That kept at least Frivolity aloof;<br/>And things more timid that beheld him near<br/>In silence gazed, or whispered mutual fear;<br/>And they the wiser, friendlier few confessed<br/>They deemed him better than his air expressed.<br/><br/>Twas strange--in youth all action and all life,<br/>Burning for pleasure, not averse from strife;<br/>Woman--the Field--the Ocean, all that gave<br/>Promise of gladness, peril of a grave,<br/>In turn he tried--he ransacked all below,<br/>And found his recompense in joy or woe,<br/>No tame, trite medium; for his feelings sought<br/>In that intenseness an escape from thought:<br/>The Tempest of his Heart in scorn had gazed<br/>On that the feebler Elements hath raised;<br/>The Rapture of his Heart had looked on high,<br/>And asked if greater dwelt beyond the sky:<br/>Chained to excess, the slave of each extreme,<br/>How woke he from the wildness of that dream!<br/>Alas! he told not--but he did awake<br/>To curse the withered heart that would not break.<br/><br/>Books, for his volume heretofore was Man,<br/>With eye more curious he appeared to scan,<br/>And oft in sudden mood, for many a day,<br/>From all communion he would start away:<br/>And then, his rarely called attendants said,<br/>Through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread<br/>O'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frowned<br/>In rude but antique portraiture around:<br/>They heard, but whispered--"_that_ must not be known--<br/>The sound of words less earthly than his own.<br/>Yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen<br/>They scarce knew what, but more than should have been.<br/>Why gazed he so upon the ghastly head<br/>Which hands profane had gathered from the dead,<br/>That still beside his opened volume lay,<br/>As if to startle all save him away?<br/>Why slept he not when others were at rest?<br/>Why heard no music, and received no guest?<br/>All was not well, they deemed--but where the wrong?<br/>Some knew perchance--but 'twere a tale too long;<br/>And such besides were too discreetly wise,<br/>To more than hint their knowledge in surmise;<br/>But if they would--they could"--around the board<br/>Thus Lara's vassals prattled of their lord.<br/><br/>It was the night--and Lara's glassy stream<br/>The stars are studding, each with imaged beam;<br/>So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,<br/>And yet they glide like Happiness away;<br/>Reflecting far and fairy-like from high<br/>The immortal lights that live along the sky:<br/>Its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,<br/>And flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;<br/>Such in her chaplet infant Dian wove,<br/>And Innocence would offer to her love.<br/>These deck the shore; the waves their channel make<br/>In windings bright and mazy like the snake.<br/>All was so still, so soft in earth and air,<br/>You scarce would start to meet a spirit there;<br/>Secure that nought of evil could delight<br/>To walk in such a scene, on such a night!<br/>It was a moment only for the good:<br/>So Lara deemed, nor longer there he stood,<br/>But turned in silence to his castle-gate;<br/>Such scene his soul no more could contemplate:<br/>Such scene reminded him of other days,<br/>Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,<br/>Of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--<br/>No--no--the storm may beat upon his brow,<br/>Unfelt, unsparing--but a night like this,<br/>A night of Beauty, mocked such breast as his.<br/><br/>He turned within his solitary hall,<br/>And his high shadow shot along the wall:<br/>There were the painted forms of other times,<br/>'Twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,<br/>Save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults<br/>That hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;<br/>And half a column of the pompous page,<br/>That speeds the specious tale from age to age;<br/>Where History's pen its praise or blame supplies,<br/>And lies like Truth, and still most truly lies.<br/>He wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone<br/>Through the dim lattice, o'er the floor of stone,<br/>And the high fretted roof, and saints, that there<br/>O'er Gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,<br/>Reflected in fantastic figures grew,<br/>Like life, but not like mortal life, to view;<br/>His bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,<br/>And the wide waving of his shaken plume,<br/>Glanced like a spectre's attributes--and gave<br/>His aspect all that terror gives the grave.<br/><br/>'Twas midnight--all was slumber; the lone light<br/>Dimmed in the lamp, as both to break the night.<br/>Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall--<br/>A sound--a voice--a shriek--a fearful call!<br/>A long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear<br/>That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?<br/>They heard and rose, and, tremulously brave,<br/>Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;<br/>They come with half-lit tapers in their hands,<br/>And snatched in startled haste unbelted brands.<br/><br/>Cold as the marble where his length was laid,<br/>Pale as the beam that o'er his features played,<br/>Was Lara stretched; his half-drawn sabre near,<br/>Dropped it should seem in more than Nature's fear;<br/>Yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,<br/>And still Defiance knit his gathered brow;<br/>Though mixed with terror, senseless as he lay,<br/>There lived upon his lip the wish to slay;<br/>Some half formed threat in utterance there had died,<br/>Some imprecation of despairing Pride;<br/>His eye was almost sealed, but not forsook,<br/>Even in its trance, the gladiator's look,<br/>That oft awake his aspect could disclose,<br/>And now was fixed in horrible repose.<br/>They raise him--bear him;--hush! he breathes, he speaks,<br/>The swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,<br/>His lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,<br/>Rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb<br/>Recalls its function, but his words are strung<br/>In terms that seem not of his native tongue;<br/>Distinct but strange, enough they understand<br/>To deem them accents of another land;<br/>And such they were, and meant to meet an ear<br/>That hears him not--alas! that cannot hear!<br/><br/>His page approached, and he alone appeared<br/>To know the import of the words they heard;<br/>And, by the changes of his cheek and brow,<br/>They were not such as Lara should avow,<br/>Nor he interpret,--yet with less surprise<br/>Than those around their Chieftain's state he eyes,<br/>But Lara's prostrate form he bent beside,<br/>And in that tongue which seemed his own replied;<br/>And Lara heeds those tones that gently seem<br/>To soothe away the horrors of his dream--<br/>If dream it were, that thus could overthrow<br/>A breast that needed not ideal woe.<br/><br/>Whate'er his frenzy dreamed or eye beheld,--<br/>If yet remembered ne'er to be revealed,--<br/>Rests at his heart: the customed morning came,<br/>And breathed new vigour in his shaken frame;<br/>And solace sought he none from priest nor leech,<br/>And soon the same in movement and in speech,<br/>As heretofore he filled the passing hours,<br/>Nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lowers,<br/>Than these were wont; and if the coming night<br/>Appeared less welcome now to Lara's sight,<br/>He to his marvelling vassals showed it not,<br/>Whose shuddering proved _their_ fear was less forgot.<br/>In trembling pairs (alone they dared not) crawl<br/>The astonished slaves, and shun the fated hall;<br/>The waving banner, and the clapping door,<br/>The rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;<br/>The long dim shadows of surrounding trees,<br/>The flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;<br/>Aught they behold or hear their thought appals,<br/>As evening saddens o'er the dark grey walls.<br/><br/>Vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravelled gloom<br/>Came not again, or Lara could assume<br/>A seeming of forgetfulness, that made<br/>His vassals more amazed nor less afraid.<br/>Had Memory vanished then with sense restored?<br/>Since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord<br/>Betrayed a feeling that recalled to these<br/>That fevered moment of his mind's disease.<br/>Was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke<br/>Those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke<br/>Their slumber? his the oppressed, o'erlaboured heart<br/>That ceased to beat, the look that made them start?<br/>Could he who thus had suffered so forget,<br/>When such as saw that suffering shudder yet?<br/>Or did that silence prove his memory fixed<br/>Too deep for words, indelible, unmixed<br/>In that corroding secrecy which gnaws<br/>The heart to show the effect, but not the cause?<br/>Not so in him; his breast had buried both,<br/>Nor common gazers could discern the growth<br/>Of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;<br/>They choke the feeble words that would unfold.<br/><br/>In him inexplicably mixed appeared<br/>Much to be loved and hated, sought and feared;<br/>Opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,<br/>In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot:<br/>His silence formed a theme for others' prate--<br/>They guessed--they gazed--they fain would know his fate.<br/>What had he been? what was he, thus unknown,<br/>Who walked their world, his lineage only known?<br/>A hater of his kind? yet some would say,<br/>With them he could seem gay amidst the gay;<br/>But owned that smile, if oft observed and near,<br/>Waned in its mirth, and withered to a sneer;<br/>That smile might reach his lip, but passed not by,<br/>Nor e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:<br/>Yet there was softness too in his regard,<br/>At times, a heart as not by nature hard,<br/>But once perceived, his Spirit seemed to chide<br/>Such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,<br/>And steeled itself, as scorning to redeem<br/>One doubt from others' half withheld esteem;<br/>In self-inflicted penance of a breast<br/>Which Tenderness might once have wrung from Rest;<br/>In vigilance of Grief that would compel<br/>The soul to hate for having loved too well.<br/><br/>There was in him a vital scorn of all:<br/>As if the worst had fallen which could befall,<br/>He stood a stranger in this breathing world,<br/>An erring Spirit from another hurled;<br/>A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped<br/>By choice the perils he by chance escaped;<br/>But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet<br/>His mind would half exult and half regret:<br/>With more capacity for love than Earth<br/>Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.<br/>His early dreams of good outstripped the truth,<br/>And troubled Manhood followed baffled Youth;<br/>With thought of years in phantom chase misspent,<br/>And wasted powers for better purpose lent;<br/>And fiery passions that had poured their wrath<br/>In hurried desolation o'er his path,<br/>And left the better feelings all at strife<br/>In wild reflection o'er his stormy life;<br/>But haughty still, and loth himself to blame,<br/>He called on Nature's self to share the shame,<br/>And charged all faults upon the fleshly form<br/>She gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm:<br/>Till he at last confounded good and ill,<br/>And half mistook for fate the acts of will:<br/>Too high for common selfishness, he could<br/>At times resign his own for others' good,<br/>But not in pity--not because he ought,<br/>But in some strange perversity of thought,<br/>That swayed him onward with a secret pride<br/>To do what few or none would do beside;<br/>And this same impulse would, in tempting time,<br/>Mislead his spirit equally to crime;<br/>So much he soared beyond, or sunk beneath,<br/>The men with whom he felt condemned to breathe,<br/>And longed by good or ill to separate<br/>Himself from all who shared his mortal state;<br/>His mind abhorring this had fixed her throne<br/>Far from the world, in regions of her own:<br/>Thus coldly passing all that passed below,<br/>His blood in temperate seeming now would flow:<br/>Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,<br/>But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!<br/>'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,<br/>And like the rest in seeming did and talked,<br/>Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,<br/>His Madness was not of the head, but heart;<br/>And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew<br/>His thoughts so forth as to offend the view.<br/><br/>With all that chilling mystery of mien,<br/>And seeming gladness to remain unseen,<br/>He had (if 'twere not nature's boon) an art<br/>Of fixing memory on another's heart:<br/>It was not love perchance--nor hate--nor aught<br/>That words can image to express the thought;<br/>But they who saw him did not see in vain,<br/>And once beheld--would ask of him again:<br/>And those to whom he spake remembered well,<br/>And on the words, however light, would dwell:<br/>None knew, nor how, nor why, but he entwined<br/>Himself perforce around the hearer's mind;<br/>There he was stamped, in liking, or in hate,<br/>If greeted once; however brief the date<br/>That friendship, pity, or aversion knew,<br/>Still there within the inmost thought he grew.<br/>You could not penetrate his soul, but found,<br/>Despite your wonder, to your own he wound;<br/>His presence haunted still; and from the breast<br/>He forced an all unwilling interest:<br/>Vain was the struggle in that mental net--<br/>His Spirit seemed to dare you to forget!<br/><br/>There is a festival, where knights and dames,<br/>And aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,<br/>Appear--a high-born and a welcome guest<br/>To Otho's hall came Lara with the rest.<br/>The long carousal shakes the illumined hall,<br/>Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;<br/>And the gay dance of bounding Beauty's train<br/>Links grace and harmony in happiest chain:<br/>Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands<br/>That mingle there in well according bands;<br/>It is a sight the careful brow might smooth,<br/>And make Age smile, and dream itself to youth,<br/>And Youth forget such hour was past on earth,<br/>So springs the exulting bosom to that mirth!<br/><br/>And Lara gazed on these, sedately glad,<br/>His brow belied him if his soul was sad;<br/>And his glance followed fast each fluttering fair,<br/>Whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:<br/>He leaned against the lofty pillar nigh,<br/>With folded arms and long attentive eye,<br/>Nor marked a glance so sternly fixed on his--<br/>Ill brooked high Lara scrutiny like this:<br/>At length he caught it--'tis a face unknown,<br/>But seems as searching his, and his alone;<br/>Prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,<br/>Who still till now had gazed on him unseen:<br/>At length encountering meets the mutual gaze<br/>Of keen enquiry, and of mute amaze;<br/>On Lara's glance emotion gathering grew,<br/>As if distrusting that the stranger threw;<br/>Along the stranger's aspect, fixed and stern,<br/>Flashed more than thence the vulgar eye could learn.<br/><br/>"'Tis he!" the stranger cried, and those that heard<br/>Re-echoed fast and far the whispered word.<br/>"'Tis he!"--"'Tis who?" they question far and near,<br/>Till louder accents rung on Lara's ear;<br/>So widely spread, few bosoms well could brook<br/>The general marvel, or that single look:<br/>But Lara stirred not, changed not, the surprise<br/>That sprung at first to his arrested eyes<br/>Seemed now subsided--neither sunk nor raised<br/>Glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;<br/>And drawing nigh, exclaimed, with haughty sneer,<br/>"'Tis he!--how came he thence?--what doth he here?"<br/><br/>It were too much for Lara to pass by<br/>Such questions, so repeated fierce and high;<br/>With look collected, but with accent cold,<br/>More mildly firm than petulantly bold,<br/>He turned, and met the inquisitorial tone--<br/>"My name is Lara--when thine own is known,<br/>Doubt not my fitting answer to requite<br/>The unlooked for courtesy of such a knight.<br/>'Tis Lara!--further wouldst thou mark or ask?<br/>I shun no question, and I wear no mask."<br/><br/>  "Thou _shunn'st_ no question! Ponder--is there none<br/>Thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?<br/>And deem'st thou me unknown too? Gaze again!<br/>At least thy memory was not given in vain.<br/>Oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt--<br/>Eternity forbids thee to forget."<br/>With slow and searching glance upon his face<br/>Grew Lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace<br/>They knew, or chose to know--with dubious look<br/>He deigned no answer, but his head he shook,<br/>And half contemptuous turned to pass away;<br/>But the stern stranger motioned him to stay.<br/><br/>  "A word!--I charge thee stay, and answer here<br/>To one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,<br/>But as thou wast and art--nay, frown not, Lord,<br/>If false, 'tis easy to disprove the word--<br/>But as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,<br/>Distrusts thy smiles, but shakes not at thy frown.<br/>Art thou not he? whose deeds----"<br/>           "Whate'er I be,<br/>Words wild as these, accusers like to thee,<br/>I list no further; those with whom they weigh<br/>May hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay<br/>The wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,<br/>Which thus begins so courteously and well.<br/>Let Otho cherish here his polished guest,<br/>To him my thanks and thoughts shall be expressed."<br/>And here their wondering host hath interposed--<br/>  "Whate'er there be between you undisclosed,<br/>This is no time nor fitting place to mar<br/>The mirthful meeting with a wordy war.<br/>If thou, Sir Ezzelin, hast aught to show<br/>Which it befits Count Lara's ear to know,<br/>To-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best<br/>Beseem your mutual judgment, speak the rest;<br/>I pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,<br/>Though, like Count Lara, now returned alone<br/>From other lands, almost a stranger grown;<br/>And if from Lara's blood and gentle birth<br/>I augur right of courage and of worth,<br/>He will not that untainted line belie,<br/>Nor aught that Knighthood may accord, deny."<br/><br/>  "To-morrow be it," Ezzelin replied,<br/>"And here our several worth and truth be tried;<br/>I gage my life, my falchion to attest<br/>My words, so may I mingle with the blest!"<br/>What answers Lara? to its centre shrunk<br/>His soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;<br/>The words of many, and the eyes of all<br/>That there were gathered, seemed on him to fall;<br/>But his were silent, his appeared to stray<br/>In far forgetfulness away--away--<br/>Alas! that heedlessness of all around<br/>Bespoke remembrance only too profound.<br/><br/>"To-morrow!--aye, to-morrow!" further word<br/>Than those repeated none from Lara heard;<br/>Upon his brow no outward passion spoke;<br/>From his large eye no flashing anger broke;<br/>Yet there was something fixed in that low tone,<br/>Which showed resolve, determined, though unknown.<br/>He seized his cloak--his head he slightly bowed,<br/>And passing Ezzelin, he left the crowd;<br/>And, as he passed him, smiling met the frown<br/>With which that Chieftain's brow would bear him down:<br/>It was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride<br/>That curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;<br/>But that of one in his own heart secure<br/>Of all that he would do, or could endure.<br/>Could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?<br/>Or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?<br/>Alas! too like in confidence are each,<br/>For man to trust to mortal look or speech;<br/>From deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern<br/>Truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn.<br/><br/>And Lara called his page, and went his way--<br/>Well could that stripling word or sign obey:<br/>His only follower from those climes afar,<br/>Where the Soul glows beneath a brighter star:<br/>For Lara left the shore from whence he sprung,<br/>In duty patient, and sedate though young;<br/>Silent as him he served, his faith appears<br/>Above his station, and beyond his years.<br/>Though not unknown the tongue of Lara's land,<br/>In such from him he rarely heard command;<br/>But fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,<br/>When Lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:<br/>Those accents, as his native mountains dear,<br/>Awake their absent echoes in his ear,<br/>Friends'--kindred's--parents'--wonted voice recall,<br/>Now lost, abjured, for one--his friend, his all:<br/>For him earth now disclosed no other guide;<br/>What marvel then he rarely left his side?<br/><br/>Light was his form, and darkly delicate<br/>That brow whereon his native sun had sate,<br/>But had not marred, though in his beams he grew,<br/>The cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;<br/>Yet not such blush as mounts when health would show<br/>All the heart's hue in that delighted glow;<br/>But 'twas a hectic tint of secret care<br/>That for a burning moment fevered there;<br/>And the wild sparkle of his eye seemed caught<br/>From high, and lightened with electric thought,<br/>Though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe<br/>Had tempered with a melancholy tinge;<br/>Yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,<br/>Or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:<br/>And pleased not him the sports that please his age,<br/>The tricks of Youth, the frolics of the Page;<br/>For hours on Lara he would fix his glance,<br/>As all-forgotten in that watchful trance;<br/>And from his chief withdrawn, he wandered lone,<br/>Brief were his answers, and his questions none;<br/>His walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;<br/>His resting-place the bank that curbs the brook:<br/>He seemed, like him he served, to live apart<br/>From all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;<br/>To know no brotherhood, and take from earth<br/>No gift beyond that bitter boon--our birth.<br/><br/>If aught he loved, 'twas Lara; but was shown<br/>His faith in reverence and in deeds alone;<br/>In mute attention; and his care, which guessed<br/>Each wish, fulfilled it ere the tongue expressed.<br/>Still there was haughtiness in all he did,<br/>A spirit deep that brooked not to be chid;<br/>His zeal, though more than that of servile hands,<br/>In act alone obeys, his air commands;<br/>As if 'twas Lara's less than _his_ desire<br/>That thus he served, but surely not for hire.<br/>Slight were the tasks enjoined him by his Lord,<br/>To hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;<br/>To tune his lute, or, if he willed it more,<br/>On tomes of other times and tongues to pore;<br/>But ne'er to mingle with the menial train,<br/>To whom he showed nor deference nor disdain,<br/>But that well-worn reserve which proved he knew<br/>No sympathy with that familiar crew:<br/>His soul, whate'er his station or his stem,<br/>Could bow to Lara, not descend to them.<br/>Of higher birth he seemed, and better days,<br/>Nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,<br/>So femininely white it might bespeak<br/>Another sex, when matched with that smooth cheek,<br/>But for his garb, and something in his gaze,<br/>More wild and high than Woman's eye betrays;<br/>A latent fierceness that far more became<br/>His fiery climate than his tender frame:<br/>True, in his words it broke not from his breast,<br/>But from his aspect might be more than guessed.<br/>Kaled his name, though rumour said he bore<br/>Another ere he left his mountain-shore;<br/>For sometimes he would hear, however nigh,<br/>That name repeated loud without reply,<br/>As unfamiliar--or, if roused again,<br/>Start to the sound, as but remembered then;<br/>Unless 'twas Lara's wonted voice that spake,<br/>For then--ear--eyes--and heart would all awake.<br/><br/>He had looked down upon the festive hall,<br/>And mark'd that sudden strife so marked of all:<br/>And when the crowd around and near him told<br/>Their wonder at the calmness of the bold,<br/>Their marvel how the high-born Lara bore<br/>Such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,<br/>The colour of young Kaled went and came,<br/>The lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;<br/>And o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw<br/>The sickening iciness of that cold dew,<br/>That rises as the busy bosom sinks<br/>With heavy thoughts from which Reflection shrinks.<br/>Yes--there be things which we must dream and dare,<br/>And execute ere thought be half aware:<br/>Whate'er might Kaled's be, it was enow<br/>To seal his lip, but agonise his brow.<br/>He gazed on Ezzelin till Lara cast<br/>That sidelong smile upon the knight he past;<br/>When Kaled saw that smile his visage fell,<br/>As if on something recognised right well:<br/>His memory read in such a meaning more<br/>Than Lara's aspect unto others wore:<br/>Forward he sprung--a moment, both were gone,<br/>And all within that hall seemed left alone;<br/>Each had so fixed his eye on Lara's mien,<br/>All had so mixed their feelings with that scene,<br/>That when his long dark shadow through the porch<br/>No more relieves the glare of yon high torch,<br/>Each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem<br/>To bound as doubting from too black a dream,<br/>Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,<br/>Because the worst is ever nearest truth.<br/>And they are gone--but Ezzelin is there,<br/>With thoughtful visage and imperious air;<br/>But long remained not; ere an hour expired<br/>He waved his hand to Otho, and retired.<br/><br/>The crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;<br/>The courteous host, and all-approving guest,<br/>Again to that accustomed couch must creep<br/>Where Joy subsides, and Sorrow sighs to sleep,<br/>And Man, o'erlaboured with his Being's strife,<br/>Shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:<br/>There lie Love's feverish hope, and Cunning's guile,<br/>Hate's working brain, and lulled Ambition's wile;<br/>O'er each vain eye Oblivion's pinions wave,<br/>And quenched Existence crouches in a grave.<br/>What better name may Slumber's bed become?<br/>Night's sepulchre, the universal home,<br/>Where Weakness--Strength--Vice--Virtue--sunk supine,<br/>Alike in naked helplessness recline;<br/>Glad for a while to heave unconscious breath,<br/>Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of Death,<br/>And shun--though Day but dawn on ills increased--<br/>That sleep,--the loveliest, since it dreams the least.<br/><br/>CANTO THE SECOND.<br/><br/>Night wanes--the vapours round the mountains curled<br/>Melt into morn, and Light awakes the world,<br/>Man has another day to swell the past,<br/>And lead him near to little, but his last;<br/>But mighty Nature bounds as from her birth,<br/>The Sun is in the heavens, and Life on earth;<br/>Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,<br/>Health on the gale, and freshness in the stream.<br/>Immortal Man! behold her glories shine,<br/>And cry, exulting inly, "They are thine!"<br/>Gaze on, while yet thy gladdened eye may see:<br/>A morrow comes when they are not for thee:<br/>And grieve what may above thy senseless bier,<br/>Nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;<br/>Nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,<br/>Nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;<br/>But creeping things shall revel in their spoil,<br/>And fit thy clay to fertilise the soil.<br/><br/>'Tis morn--'tis noon--assembled in the hall,<br/>The gathered Chieftains come to Otho's call;<br/>'Tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim<br/>The life or death of Lara's future fame;<br/>And Ezzelin his charge may here unfold,<br/>And whatsoe'er the tale, it must be told.<br/>His faith was pledged, and Lara's promise given,<br/>To meet it in the eye of Man and Heaven.<br/>Why comes he not? Such truths to be divulged,<br/>Methinks the accuser's rest is long indulged.<br/><br/>The hour is past, and Lara too is there,<br/>With self-confiding, coldly patient air;<br/>Why comes not Ezzelin? The hour is past,<br/>And murmurs rise, and Otho's brow's o'ercast.<br/>"I know my friend! his faith I cannot fear,<br/>If yet he be on earth, expect him here;<br/>The roof that held him in the valley stands<br/>Between my own and noble Lara's lands;<br/>My halls from such a guest had honour gained,<br/>Nor had Sir Ezzelin his host disdained,<br/>But that some previous proof forbade his stay,<br/>And urged him to prepare against to-day;<br/>The word I pledged for his I pledge again,<br/>Or will myself redeem his knighthood's stain."<br/>He ceased--and Lara answered, "I am here<br/>To lend at thy demand a listening ear<br/>To tales of evil from a stranger's tongue,<br/>Whose words already might my heart have wrung,<br/>But that I deemed him scarcely less than mad,<br/>Or, at the worst, a foe ignobly bad.<br/>I know him not--but me it seems he knew<br/>In lands where--but I must not trifle too:<br/>Produce this babbler--or redeem the pledge;<br/>Here in thy hold, and with thy falchion's edge."<br/><br/>Proud Otho on the instant, reddening, threw<br/>His glove on earth, and forth his sabre flew.<br/>"The last alternative befits me best,<br/>And thus I answer for mine absent guest."<br/><br/>With cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,<br/>However near his own or other's tomb;<br/>With hand, whose almost careless coolness spoke<br/>Its grasp well-used to deal the sabre-stroke;<br/>With eye, though calm, determined not to spare,<br/>Did Lara too his willing weapon bare.<br/>In vain the circling Chieftains round them closed,<br/>For Otho's frenzy would not be opposed;<br/>And from his lip those words of insult fell--<br/>His sword is good who can maintain them well.<br/><br/>Short was the conflict; furious, blindly rash,<br/>Vain Otho gave his bosom to the gash:<br/>He bled, and fell; but not with deadly wound,<br/>Stretched by a dextrous sleight along the ground.<br/>"Demand thy life!" He answered not: and then<br/>From that red floor he ne'er had risen again,<br/>For Lara's brow upon the moment grew<br/>Almost to blackness in its demon hue;<br/>And fiercer shook his angry falchion now<br/>Than when his foe's was levelled at his brow;<br/>Then all was stern collectedness and art,<br/>Now rose the unleavened hatred of his heart;<br/>So little sparing to the foe he felled,<br/>That when the approaching crowd his arm withheld,<br/>He almost turned the thirsty point on those<br/>Who thus for mercy dared to interpose;<br/>But to a moment's thought that purpose bent;<br/>Yet looked he on him still with eye intent,<br/>As if he loathed the ineffectual strife<br/>That left a foe, howe'er o'erthrown, with life;<br/>As if to search how far the wound he gave<br/>Had sent its victim onward to his grave.<br/><br/>They raised the bleeding Otho, and the Leech<br/>Forbade all present question, sign, and speech;<br/>The others met within a neighbouring hall,<br/>And he, incensed, and heedless of them all,<br/>The cause and conqueror in this sudden fray,<br/>In haughty silence slowly strode away;<br/>He backed his steed, his homeward path he took,<br/>Nor cast on Otho's towers a single look.<br/><br/>But where was he? that meteor of a night,<br/>Who menaced but to disappear with light.<br/>Where was this Ezzelin? who came and went,<br/>To leave no other trace of his intent.<br/>He left the dome of Otho long ere morn,<br/>In darkness, yet so well the path was worn<br/>He could not miss it: near his dwelling lay;<br/>But there he was not, and with coming day<br/>Came fast inquiry, which unfolded nought,<br/>Except the absence of the Chief it sought.<br/>A chamber tenantless, a steed at rest,<br/>His host alarmed, his murmuring squires distressed:<br/>Their search extends along, around the path,<br/>In dread to meet the marks of prowlers' wrath:<br/>But none are there, and not a brake hath borne<br/>Nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;<br/>Nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,<br/>Which still retains a mark where Murder was;<br/>Nor dabbling fingers left to tell the tale,<br/>The bitter print of each convulsive nail,<br/>When agonis√©d hands that cease to guard,<br/>Wound in that pang the smoothness of the sward.<br/>Some such had been, if here a life was reft,<br/>But these were not; and doubting Hope is left;<br/>And strange Suspicion, whispering Lara's name,<br/>Now daily mutters o'er his blackened fame;<br/>Then sudden silent when his form appeared,<br/>Awaits the absence of the thing it feared<br/>Again its wonted wondering to renew,<br/>And dye conjecture with a darker hue.<br/><br/>Days roll along, and Otho's wounds are healed,<br/>But not his pride; and hate no more concealed:<br/>He was a man of power, and Lara's foe,<br/>The friend of all who sought to work him woe,<br/>And from his country's justice now demands<br/>Account of Ezzelin at Lara's hands.<br/>Who else than Lara could have cause to fear<br/>His presence? who had made him disappear,<br/>If not the man on whom his menaced charge<br/>Had sate too deeply were he left at large?<br/>The general rumour ignorantly loud,<br/>The mystery dearest to the curious crowd;<br/>The seeming friendliness of him who strove<br/>To win no confidence, and wake no love;<br/>The sweeping fierceness which his soul betrayed,<br/>The skill with which he wielded his keen blade;<br/>Where had his arm unwarlike caught that art?<br/>Where had that fierceness grown upon his heart?<br/>For it was not the blind capricious rage<br/>A word can kindle and a word assuage;<br/>But the deep working of a soul unmixed<br/>With aught of pity where its wrath had fixed;<br/>Such as long power and overgorged success<br/>Concentrates into all that's merciless:<br/>These, linked with that desire which ever sways<br/>Mankind, the rather to condemn than praise,<br/>'Gainst Lara gathering raised at length a storm,<br/>Such as himself might fear, and foes would form,<br/>And he must answer for the absent head<br/>Of one that haunts him still, alive or dead.<br/><br/>Within that land was many a malcontent,<br/>Who cursed the tyranny to which he bent;<br/>That soil full many a wringing despot saw,<br/>Who worked his wantonness in form of law;<br/>Long war without and frequent broil within<br/>Had made a path for blood and giant sin,<br/>That waited but a signal to begin<br/>New havoc, such as civil discord blends,<br/>Which knows no neuter, owns but foes or friends;<br/>Fixed in his feudal fortress each was lord,<br/>In word and deed obeyed, in soul abhorred.<br/>Thus Lara had inherited his lands,<br/>And with them pining hearts and sluggish hands;<br/>But that long absence from his native clime<br/>Had left him stainless of Oppression's crime,<br/>And now, diverted by his milder sway,<br/>All dread by slow degrees had worn away.<br/>The menials felt their usual awe alone,<br/>But more for him than them that fear was grown;<br/>They deemed him now unhappy, though at first<br/>Their evil judgment augured of the worst,<br/>And each long restless night, and silent mood,<br/>Was traced to sickness, fed by solitude:<br/>And though his lonely habits threw of late<br/>Gloom o'er his chamber, cheerful was his gate;<br/>For thence the wretched ne'er unsoothed withdrew,<br/>For them, at least, his soul compassion knew.<br/>Cold to the great, contemptuous to the high,<br/>The humble passed not his unheeding eye;<br/>Much he would speak not, but beneath his roof<br/>They found asylum oft, and ne'er reproof.<br/>And they who watched might mark that, day by day,<br/>Some new retainers gathered to his sway;<br/>But most of late, since Ezzelin was lost,<br/>He played the courteous lord and bounteous host:<br/>Perchance his strife with Otho made him dread<br/>Some snare prepared for his obnoxious head;<br/>Whate'er his view, his favour more obtains<br/>With these, the people, than his fellow thanes.<br/>If this were policy, so far 'twas sound,<br/>The million judged but of him as they found;<br/>From him by sterner chiefs to exile driven<br/>They but required a shelter, and 'twas given.<br/>By him no peasant mourned his rifled cot,<br/>And scarce the Serf could murmur o'er his lot;<br/>With him old Avarice found its hoard secure,<br/>With him contempt forbore to mock the poor;<br/>Youth present cheer and promised recompense<br/>Detained, till all too late to part from thence:<br/>To Hate he offered, with the coming change,<br/>The deep reversion of delayed revenge;<br/>To Love, long baffled by the unequal match,<br/>The well-won charms success was sure to snatch.<br/>All now was ripe, he waits but to proclaim<br/>That slavery nothing which was still a name.<br/>The moment came, the hour when Otho thought<br/>Secure at last the vengeance which he sought:<br/>His summons found the destined criminal<br/>Begirt by thousands in his swarming hall;<br/>Fresh from their feudal fetters newly riven,<br/>Defying earth, and confident of heaven.<br/>That morning he had freed the soil-bound slaves,<br/>Who dig no land for tyrants but their graves!<br/>Such is their cry--some watchword for the fight<br/>Must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right;<br/>Religion--Freedom--Vengeance--what you will,<br/>A word's enough to raise Mankind to kill;<br/>Some factious phrase by cunning caught and spread,<br/>That Guilt may reign-and wolves and worms be fed!<br/><br/>Throughout that clime the feudal Chiefs had gained<br/>Such sway, their infant monarch hardly reigned;<br/>Now was the hour for Faction's rebel growth,<br/>The Serfs contemned the one, and hated both:<br/>They waited but a leader, and they found<br/>One to their cause inseparably bound;<br/>By circumstance compelled to plunge again,<br/>In self-defence, amidst the strife of men.<br/>Cut off by some mysterious fate from those<br/>Whom Birth and Nature meant not for his foes,<br/>Had Lara from that night, to him accurst,<br/>Prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:<br/>Some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun<br/>Inquiry into deeds at distance done;<br/>By mingling with his own the cause of all,<br/>E'en if he failed, he still delayed his fall.<br/>The sullen calm that long his bosom kept,<br/>The storm that once had spent itself and slept,<br/>Roused by events that seemed foredoomed to urge<br/>His gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,<br/>Burst forth, and made him all he once had been,<br/>And is again; he only changed the scene.<br/>Light care had he for life, and less for fame,<br/>But not less fitted for the desperate game:<br/>He deemed himself marked out for others' hate,<br/>And mocked at Ruin so they shared his fate.<br/>And cared he for the freedom of the crowd?<br/>He raised the humble but to bend the proud.<br/>He had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,<br/>But Man and Destiny beset him there:<br/>Inured to hunters, he was found at bay;<br/>And they must kill, they cannot snare the prey.<br/>Stern, unambitious, silent, he had been<br/>Henceforth a calm spectator of Life's scene;<br/>But dragged again upon the arena, stood<br/>A leader not unequal to the feud;<br/>In voice--mien--gesture--savage nature spoke,<br/>And from his eye the gladiator broke.<br/><br/>What boots the oft-repeated tale of strife,<br/>The feast of vultures, and the waste of life?<br/>The varying fortune of each separate field,<br/>The fierce that vanquish, and the faint that yield?<br/>The smoking ruin, and the crumbled wall?<br/>In this the struggle was the same with all;<br/>Save that distempered passions lent their force<br/>In bitterness that banished all remorse.<br/>None sued, for Mercy knew her cry was vain,<br/>The captive died upon the battle-plain:<br/>In either cause, one rage alone possessed<br/>The empire of the alternate victor's breast;<br/>And they that smote for freedom or for sway,<br/>Deemed few were slain, while more remained to slay.<br/>It was too late to check the wasting brand,<br/>And Desolation reaped the famished land;<br/>The torch was lighted, and the flame was spread,<br/>And Carnage smiled upon her daily dead.<br/><br/>Fresh with the nerve the new-born impulse strung,<br/>The first success to Lara's numbers clung:<br/>But that vain victory hath ruined all;<br/>They form no longer to their leader's call:<br/>In blind confusion on the foe they press,<br/>And think to snatch is to secure success.<br/>The lust of booty, and the thirst of hate,<br/>Lure on the broken brigands to their fate:<br/>In vain he doth whate'er a chief may do,<br/>To check the headlong fury of that crew;<br/>In vain their stubborn ardour he would tame,<br/>The hand that kindles cannot quench the flame;<br/>The wary foe alone hath turned their mood,<br/>And shown their rashness to that erring brood:<br/>The feigned retreat, the nightly ambuscade,<br/>The daily harass, and the fight delayed,<br/>The long privation of the hoped supply,<br/>The tentless rest beneath the humid sky,<br/>The stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,<br/>And palls the patience of his baffled art,<br/>Of these they had not deemed: the battle-day<br/>They could encounter as a veteran may;<br/>But more preferred the fury of the strife,<br/>And present death, to hourly suffering life:<br/>And Famine wrings, and Fever sweeps away<br/>His numbers melting fast from their array;<br/>Intemperate triumph fades to discontent,<br/>And Lara's soul alone seems still unbent;<br/>But few remain to aid his voice and hand,<br/>And thousands dwindled to a scanty band:<br/>Desperate, though few, the last and best remained<br/>To mourn the discipline they late disdained.<br/>One hope survives, the frontier is not far,<br/>And thence they may escape from native war:<br/>And bear within them to the neighbouring state<br/>An exile's sorrows, or an outlaw's hate:<br/>Hard is the task their father-land to quit,<br/>But harder still to perish or submit.<br/><br/>It is resolved--they march--consenting Night<br/>Guides with her star their dim and torchless flight;<br/>Already they perceive its tranquil beam<br/>Sleep on the surface of the barrier stream;<br/>Already they descry--Is yon the bank?<br/>Away! 'tis lined with many a hostile rank.<br/>Return or fly!--What glitters in the rear?<br/>'Tis Otho's banner--the pursuer's spear!<br/>Are those the shepherds' fires upon the height?<br/>Alas! they blaze too widely for the flight:<br/>Cut off from hope, and compassed in the toil,<br/>Less blood perchance hath bought a richer spoil!<br/><br/>A moment's pause--'tis but to breathe their band,<br/>Or shall they onward press, or here withstand?<br/>It matters little--if they charge the foes<br/>Who by their border-stream their march oppose,<br/>Some few, perchance, may break and pass the line,<br/>However linked to baffle such design.<br/>"The charge be ours! to wait for their assault<br/>Were fate well worthy of a coward's halt."<br/>Forth flies each sabre, reined is every steed,<br/>And the next word shall scarce outstrip the deed:<br/>In the next tone of Lara's gathering breath<br/>How many shall but hear the voice of Death!<br/><br/>His blade is bared,--in him there is an air<br/>As deep, but far too tranquil for despair;<br/>A something of indifference more than then<br/>Becomes the bravest, if they feel for men--<br/>He turned his eye on Kaled, ever near,<br/>And still too faithful to betray one fear;<br/>Perchance 'twas but the moon's dim twilight threw<br/>Along his aspect an unwonted hue<br/>Of mournful paleness, whose deep tint expressed<br/>The truth, and not the terror of his breast.<br/>This Lara marked, and laid his hand on his:<br/>It trembled not in such an hour as this;<br/>His lip was silent, scarcely beat his heart,<br/>His eye alone proclaimed, "We will not part!<br/>Thy band may perish, or thy friends may flee,<br/>Farewell to Life--but not Adieu to thee!"<br/><br/>The word hath passed his lips, and onward driven,<br/>Pours the linked band through ranks asunder riven:<br/>Well has each steed obeyed the arm√©d heel,<br/>And flash the scimitars, and rings the steel;<br/>Outnumbered, not outbraved, they still oppose<br/>Despair to daring, and a front to foes;<br/>And blood is mingled with the dashing stream,<br/>Which runs all redly till the morning beam.<br/><br/>Commanding--aiding--animating all,<br/>Where foe appeared to press, or friend to fall,<br/>Cheers Lara's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,<br/>Inspiring hope, himself had ceased to feel.<br/>None fled, for well they knew that flight were vain;<br/>But those that waver turn to smite again,<br/>While yet they find the firmest of the foe<br/>Recoil before their leader's look and blow:<br/>Now girt with numbers, now almost alone,<br/>He foils their ranks, or re-unites his own;<br/>Himself he spared not--once they seemed to fly--<br/>Now was the time, he waved his hand on high,<br/>And shook--Why sudden droops that plum√©d crest?<br/>The shaft is sped--the arrow's in his breast!<br/>That fatal gesture left the unguarded side,<br/>And Death has stricken down yon arm of pride.<br/>The word of triumph fainted from his tongue;<br/>That hand, so raised, how droopingly it hung!<br/>But yet the sword instinctively retains,<br/>Though from its fellow shrink the falling reins;<br/>These Kaled snatches: dizzy with the blow,<br/>And senseless bending o'er his saddle-bow,<br/>Perceives not Lara that his anxious page<br/>Beguiles his charger from the combat's rage:<br/>Meantime his followers charge, and charge again;<br/>Too mixed the slayers now to heed the slain!<br/><br/>Day glimmers on the dying and the dead,<br/>The cloven cuirass, and the helmless head;<br/>The war-horse masterless is on the earth,<br/>And that last gasp hath burst his bloody girth;<br/>And near, yet quivering with what life remained,<br/>The heel that urged him and the hand that reined;<br/>And some too near that rolling torrent lie,<br/>Whose waters mock the lip of those that die;<br/>That panting thirst which scorches in the breath<br/>Of those that die the soldier's fiery death,<br/>In vain impels the burning mouth to crave<br/>One drop--the last--to cool it for the grave;<br/>With feeble and convulsive effort swept,<br/>Their limbs along the crimsoned turf have crept;<br/>The faint remains of life such struggles waste,<br/>But yet they reach the stream, and bend to taste:<br/>They feel its freshness, and almost partake--<br/>Why pause? No further thirst have they to slake--<br/>It is unquenched, and yet they feel it not;<br/>It was an agony--but now forgot!<br/><br/>Beneath a lime, remoter from the scene,<br/>Where but for him that strife had never been,<br/>A breathing but devoted warrior lay:<br/>'Twas Lara bleeding fast from life away.<br/>His follower once, and now his only guide,<br/>Kneels Kaled watchful o'er his welling side,<br/>And with his scarf would staunch the tides that rush,<br/>With each convulsion, in a blacker gush;<br/>And then, as his faint breathing waxes low,<br/>In feebler, not less fatal tricklings flow:<br/>He scarce can speak, but motions him 'tis vain,<br/>And merely adds another throb to pain.<br/>He clasps the hand that pang which would assuage,<br/>And sadly smiles his thanks to that dark page,<br/>Who nothing fears--nor feels--nor heeds--nor sees--<br/>Save that damp brow which rests upon his knees;<br/>Save that pale aspect, where the eye, though dim,<br/>Held all the light that shone on earth for him.<br/><br/>The foe arrives, who long had searched the field,<br/>Their triumph nought till Lara too should yield:<br/>They would remove him, but they see 'twere vain,<br/>And he regards them with a calm disdain,<br/>That rose to reconcile him with his fate,<br/>And that escape to death from living hate:<br/>And Otho comes, and leaping from his steed,<br/>Looks on the bleeding foe that made him bleed,<br/>And questions of his state; he answers not,<br/>Scarce glances on him as on one forgot,<br/>And turns to Kaled:--each remaining word<br/>They understood not, if distinctly heard;<br/>His dying tones are in that other tongue,<br/>To which some strange remembrance wildly clung.<br/>They spake of other scenes, but what--is known<br/>To Kaled, whom their meaning reached alone;<br/>And he replied, though faintly, to their sound,<br/>While gazed the rest in dumb amazement round:<br/>They seemed even then--that twain--unto the last<br/>To half forget the present in the past;<br/>To share between themselves some separate fate,<br/>Whose darkness none beside should penetrate.<br/><br/>Their words though faint were many--from the tone<br/>Their import those who heard could judge alone;<br/>From this, you might have deemed young Kaled's death<br/>More near than Lara's by his voice and breath,<br/>So sad--so deep--and hesitating broke<br/>The accents his scarce-moving pale lips spoke;<br/>But Lara's voice, though low, at first was clear<br/>And calm, till murmuring Death gasped hoarsely near;<br/>But from his visage little could we guess,<br/>So unrepentant--dark--and passionless,<br/>Save that when struggling nearer to his last,<br/>Upon that page his eye was kindly cast;<br/>And once, as Kaled's answering accents ceased,<br/>Rose Lara's hand, and pointed to the East:<br/>Whether (as then the breaking Sun from high<br/>Rolled back the clouds) the morrow caught his eye,<br/>Or that 'twas chance--or some remembered scene,<br/>That raised his arm to point where such had been,<br/>Scarce Kaled seemed to know, but turned away,<br/>As if his heart abhorred that coming day,<br/>And shrunk his glance before that morning light,<br/>To look on Lara's brow--where all grew night.<br/>Yet sense seemed left, though better were its loss;<br/>For when one near displayed the absolving Cross,<br/>And proffered to his touch the holy bead,<br/>Of which his parting soul might own the need,<br/>He looked upon it with an eye profane,<br/>And smiled--Heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain:<br/>And Kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew<br/>From Lara's face his fixed despairing view,<br/>With brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,<br/>Flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,<br/>As if such but disturbed the expiring man,<br/>Nor seemed to know his life but _then_ began--<br/>That Life of Immortality, secure<br/>To none, save them whose faith in Christ is sure.<br/><br/>But gasping heaved the breath that Lara drew,<br/>And dull the film along his dim eye grew;<br/>His limbs stretched fluttering, and his head drooped o'er<br/>The weak yet still untiring knee that bore;<br/>He pressed the hand he held upon his heart--<br/>It beats no more, but Kaled will not part<br/>With the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,<br/>For that faint throb which answers not again.<br/>"It beats!"--Away, thou dreamer! he is gone--<br/>It once _was_ Lara which thou look'st upon.<br/><br/>He gazed, as if not yet had passed away<br/>The haughty spirit of that humbled clay;<br/>And those around have roused him from his trance,<br/>But cannot tear from thence his fix√©d glance;<br/>And when, in raising him from where he bore<br/>Within his arms the form that felt no more,<br/>He saw the head his breast would still sustain,<br/>Roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;<br/>He did not dash himself thereby, nor tear<br/>The glossy tendrils of his raven hair,<br/>But strove to stand and gaze, but reeled and fell,<br/>Scarce breathing more than that he loved so well.<br/>Than that _he_ loved! Oh! never yet beneath<br/>The breast of _man_ such trusty love may breathe!<br/>That trying moment hath at once revealed<br/>The secret long and yet but half concealed;<br/>In baring to revive that lifeless breast,<br/>Its grief seemed ended, but the sex confessed;<br/>And life returned, and Kaled felt no shame--<br/>What now to her was Womanhood or Fame?<br/><br/>And Lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,<br/>But where he died his grave was dug as deep;<br/>Nor is his mortal slumber less profound,<br/>Though priest nor blessed nor marble decked the mound,<br/>And he was mourned by one whose quiet grief,<br/>Less loud, outlasts a people's for their Chief.<br/>Vain was all question asked her of the past,<br/>And vain e'en menace--silent to the last;<br/>She told nor whence, nor why she left behind<br/>Her all for one who seemed but little kind.<br/>Why did she love him? Curious fool!--be still--<br/>Is human love the growth of human will?<br/>To her he might be gentleness; the stern<br/>Have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern,<br/>And when they love, your smilers guess not how<br/>Beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow.<br/>They were not common links, that formed the chain<br/>That bound to Lara Kaled's heart and brain;<br/>But that wild tale she brooked not to unfold,<br/>And sealed is now each lip that could have told.<br/><br/>They laid him in the earth, and on his breast,<br/>Besides the wound that sent his soul to rest,<br/>They found the scattered dints of many a scar,<br/>Which were not planted there in recent war;<br/>Where'er had passed his summer years of life,<br/>It seems they vanished in a land of strife;<br/>But all unknown his Glory or his Guilt,<br/>These only told that somewhere blood was spilt,<br/>And Ezzelin, who might have spoke the past,<br/>Returned no more--that night appeared his last.<br/><br/>Upon that night (a peasant's is the tale)<br/>A Serf that crossed the intervening vale,<br/>When Cynthia's light almost gave way to morn,<br/>And nearly veiled in mist her waning horn;<br/>A Serf, that rose betimes to thread the wood,<br/>And hew the bough that bought his children's food,<br/>Passed by the river that divides the plain<br/>Of Otho's lands and Lara's broad domain:<br/>He heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke<br/>From out the wood--before him was a cloak<br/>Wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,<br/>Bent was his head, and hidden was his brow.<br/>Roused by the sudden sight at such a time,<br/>And some foreboding that it might be crime,<br/>Himself unheeded watched the stranger's course,<br/>Who reached the river, bounded from his horse,<br/>And lifting thence the burthen which he bore,<br/>Heaved up the bank, and dashed it from the shore,<br/>Then paused--and looked--and turned--and seemed to watch,<br/>And still another hurried glance would snatch,<br/>And follow with his step the stream that flowed,<br/>As if even yet too much its surface showed;<br/>At once he started--stooped--around him strown<br/>The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:<br/>Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,<br/>And slung them with a more than common care.<br/>Meantime the Serf had crept to where unseen<br/>Himself might safely mark what this might mean;<br/>He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,<br/>And something glittered starlike on the vest;<br/>But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,<br/>A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:<br/>It rose again, but indistinct to view,<br/>And left the waters of a purple hue,<br/>Then deeply disappeared: the horseman gazed<br/>Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;<br/>Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,<br/>And instant spurred him into panting speed.<br/>His face was masked--the features of the dead,<br/>If dead it were, escaped the observer's dread;<br/>But if in sooth a Star its bosom bore,<br/>Such is the badge that Knighthood ever wore,<br/>And such 'tis known Sir Ezzelin had worn<br/>Upon the night that led to such a morn.<br/>If thus he perished, Heaven receive his soul!<br/>His undiscovered limbs to ocean roll;<br/>And charity upon the hope would dwell<br/>It was not Lara's hand by which he fell.<br/><br/>And Kaled--Lara--Ezzelin, are gone,<br/>Alike without their monumental stone!<br/>The first, all efforts vainly strove to wean<br/>From lingering where her Chieftain's blood had been:<br/>Grief had so tamed a spirit once too proud,<br/>Her tears were few, her wailing never loud;<br/>But furious would you tear her from the spot<br/>Where yet she scarce believed that he was not,<br/>Her eye shot forth with all the living fire<br/>That haunts the tigress in her whelpless ire;<br/>But left to waste her weary moments there,<br/>She talked all idly unto shapes of air,<br/>Such as the busy brain of Sorrow paints,<br/>And woos to listen to her fond complaints:<br/>And she would sit beneath the very tree<br/>Where lay his drooping head upon her knee;<br/>And in that posture where she saw him fall,<br/>His words, his looks, his dying grasp recall;<br/>And she had shorn, but saved her raven hair,<br/>And oft would snatch it from her bosom there,<br/>And fold, and press it gently to the ground,<br/>As if she staunched anew some phantom's wound.<br/>Herself would question, and for him reply;<br/>Then rising, start, and beckon him to fly<br/>From some imagined Spectre in pursuit;<br/>Then seat her down upon some linden's root,<br/>And hide her visage with her meagre hand,<br/>Or trace strange characters along the sand--<br/>This could not last--she lies by him she loved;<br/>Her tale untold--her truth too dearly proved.
