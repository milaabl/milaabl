# üíÆ The Discontent. by *Anne Killigrew*

    I.<br/>HEre take no Care, take here no Care, my Muse,<br/>  Nor ought of Art or Labour use:<br/>  But let thy Lines rude and unpolisht go,<br/>Nor Equal be their Feet, nor Num'rous let them flow.<br/>  The ruggeder my Measures run when read,<br/>They'l livelier paint th'unequal Paths fond Mortals tread.<br/>  Who when th'are tempted by the smooth Ascents,<br/>    Which flatt'ring Hope presents,<br/>  Briskly they clime, and Great Things undertake;<br/> But Fatal Voyages, alas, they make:<br/>    For 'tis not long before their Feet,<br/>    Inextricable Mazes meet,<br/>    Perplexing Doubts obstruct their Way,<br/>    Mountains with-stand them of Dismay;<br/>  Or to the Brink of black Dispaire them lead,<br/>    Where's nought their Ruine to impede,<br/><br/>  In vain for Aide they then to Reason call,<br/>  Their Senses dazle, and their Heads turn round,<br/>    The sight does all their Pow'rs confound,<br/>And headlong down the horrid Precipice they fall:<br/>    Where storms of Sighs for ever blow,<br/>    Where raped streams of Tears do flow,<br/>    Which drown them in a Briny Floud.<br/>My Muse pronounce aloud, there's nothing Good,<br/>      Nought that the World can show,<br/>      Nought that it can bestow.<br/><br/>II.<br/>  Not boundless Heaps of its admired Clay,<br/>    Ah, too successful to betray,<br/>    When spread in our fraile Vertues way:<br/>  For few do run with so Resolv'd a Pace,<br/>That for the Golden Apple will not loose the Race.<br/>  And yet not all the Gold the Vain would spend,<br/>    Or greedy Avarice would wish to save;<br/>  Which on the Earth refulgent Beams doth send,<br/>    Or in the Sea has found a Grave,<br/>  Joyn'd in one Mass, can Bribe sufficient be,<br/>  The Body from a stern Disease to free,<br/>    Or purchase for the Minds relief<br/>One Moments sweet Repose, when restless made by grief,<br/>But what may Laughter, more than Pity, move:<br/>  When some the Price of what they Dear'st Love<br/>  Are Masters of, and hold it in their Hand,<br/>  To part with it their Hearts they can't command:<br/>  But chose to miss, what miss't does them torment,<br/>  And that to hug, affords them no Content.<br/>  Wise Fools, to do them Right, we these must hold,<br/>  Who Love depose, and Homage pay to Gold.<br/><br/>III.<br/>   Nor yet, if rightly understood,<br/>   Does Grandeur carry more of Good;<br/>  To be o'th' Number of the Great enroll'd,<br/>  A Scepter o're a Mighty Realm to hold.<br/>       For what is this?<br/>       If I not judge amiss.<br/>  But all th'Afflicted of a Land to take,<br/>  And of one single Family to make?<br/>    The Wrong'd, the Poor, th'Opprest, the Sad,<br/>    The Ruin'd, Malecontent, and Mad?<br/><br/>  Which a great Part of ev'ry Empire frame,<br/>  And Interest in the common Father claime.<br/>  Again what is't, but always to abide<br/>  A Gazing Crowd? upon a Stage to spend<br/>  A Life that's vain, or Evil without End?<br/>And which is yet not safely held, nor laid aside?<br/>And then, if lesser Titles carry less of Care,<br/>Yet none but Fools ambitious are to share<br/>Such a Mock-Good, of which 'tis said, 'tis Best,<br/>When of the least of it Men are possest.<br/><br/>IV.<br/>  But, O, the Laurel'd Fool! that doats on Fame,<br/>  Whose Hope's Applause, whose Fear's to want a Name;<br/>      Who can accept for Pay<br/>      Of what he does, what others say;<br/>  Exposes now to hostile Arms his Breast,<br/>To toylsome Study then betrays his Rest;<br/>  Now to his Soul denies a just Content,<br/>  Then forces on it what it does resent;<br/>  And all for Praise of Fools: for such are those,<br/>  Which most of the Admiring Crowd compose.<br/>  O famisht Soul, which such Thin Food can feed!<br/>  O Wretched Labour crown'd with such a Meed!<br/><br/>  Too loud, O Fame! thy Trumpet is, too shrill,<br/>      To lull a Mind to Rest,<br/>      Or calme a stormy Breast,<br/>     Which asks a Musick soft and still.<br/>     'Twas not Amaleck's vanquisht Cry,<br/>     Nor Israels shout of Victory,<br/>     That could in Saul the rising Passion lay,<br/>'Twas the soft strains of David's Lyre the Evil Spirit chace't away.<br/><br/>V.<br/>  But Friendship fain would yet it self defend,<br/>     And Mighty Things it does pretend,<br/>  To be of this Sad Journey, Life, the Baite,<br/>The Sweet Refection of our toylsome State.<br/>  But though True Friendship a Rich Cordial be,<br/>     Alas, by most 'tis so alay'd,<br/>     Its Good so mixt with Ill we see,<br/>     That Dross for Gold is often paid.<br/>  And for one Grain of Friendship that is found,<br/>  Falshood and Interest do the Mass compound,<br/>Or coldness, worse than Steel, the Loyal heart doth wound.<br/>  Love in no Two was ever yet the same,<br/>  No Happy Two ere felt an Equal Flame.<br/><br/>VI.<br/>  Is there that Earth by Humane Foot ne're prest?<br/>  That Aire which never yet by Humane Breast<br/>  Respir'd, did Life supply?<br/>     Oh, thither let me fly!<br/>     Where from the World at such a distance set,<br/>All that's past, present, and to come I may forget:<br/>  The Lovers Sighs, and the Afflicted Tears,<br/>  What e're may wound my Eyes or Ears.<br/>     The grating Noise of Private Jars,<br/>     The horrid sound of Publick Wars,<br/>     Of babling Fame the Idle Stories,<br/>     The short-liv'd Triumphs Noysy-Glories,<br/>     The Curious Nets the subtile weave,<br/>     The Word, the Look that may deceive.<br/>No Mundan Care shall more affect my Breast,<br/>     My profound Peace shake or molest:<br/>But Stupor, like to Death, my Senses bind,<br/>     That so I may anticipate that Rest,<br/>Which only in my Grave I hope to find.
