<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Sardanapalus by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    ACT I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Palace_.<br/><br/>_Salemenes_ (_solus_).<br/>He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her lord;<br/>He hath wronged my sister--still he is my brother;<br/>He hath wronged his people--still he is their sovereign--<br/>And I must be his friend as well as subject:<br/>He must not perish thus. I will not see<br/>The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis<br/>Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years<br/>Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale;<br/>He must be roused. In his effeminate heart<br/>There is a careless courage which Corruption<br/>Has not all quenched, and latent energies,<br/>Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--<br/>Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness.<br/>If born a peasant, he had been a man<br/>To have reached an empire: to an empire born,<br/>He will bequeath none; nothing but a name,<br/>Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--<br/>Yet--not all lost--even yet--he may redeem<br/>His sloth and shame, by only being that<br/>Which he should be, as easily as the thing<br/>He should not be and is. Were it less toil<br/>To sway his nations than consume his life?<br/>To head an army than to rule a harem?<br/>He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul,<br/>And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not<br/>Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--<br/>He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound<br/>                             [_Sound of soft music heard from within_.<br/>To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--<br/>The lyre--the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings<br/>Of lulling instruments, the softening voices<br/>Of women, and of beings less than women,<br/>Must chime in to the echo of his revel,<br/>While the great King of all we know of earth<br/>Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem<br/>Lies negligently by to be caught up<br/>By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it.<br/>Lo, where they come! already I perceive<br/>The reeking odours of the perfumed trains,<br/>And see the bright gems of the glittering girls,<br/>At once his Chorus and his Council, flash<br/>Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels,<br/>As femininely garbed, and scarce less female,<br/>The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--<br/>He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him,<br/>And tell him what all good men tell each other,<br/>Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves<br/>Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.<br/><br/>SCENE II.<br/><br/>       _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _effeminately dressed, his Head<br/>     crowned with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing,<br/>         attended by a Train of Women and young Slaves_.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_speaking to some of his attendants_).<br/>Let the pavilion over the Euphrates<br/>Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth<br/>For an especial banquet; at the hour<br/>Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting,<br/>And bid the galley be prepared. There is<br/>A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river:<br/>We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign<br/>To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus,<br/>We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour,<br/>When we shall gather like the stars above us,<br/>And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs;<br/>Till then, let each be mistress of her time,<br/>And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha, choose;<br/>Wilt thou along with them or me?<br/><br/>_Myr._                          My Lord--<br/><br/>_Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?<br/>It is the curse of kings to be so answered.<br/>Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou<br/>Accompany our guests, or charm away<br/>The moments from me?<br/><br/>_Myr._              The King's choice is mine.<br/><br/>_Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy<br/>Is to contribute to thine every wish.<br/>I do not dare to breathe my own desire,<br/>Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still<br/>Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.<br/><br/>_Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness<br/>Save in beholding thine; yet--<br/><br/>_Sar._                         Yet! what YET?<br/>Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier<br/>Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.<br/><br/>_Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour<br/>Of council; it were better I retire.<br/><br/>_Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)<br/>The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?<br/><br/>_Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,<br/>And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_addressing his train_).<br/>As I have said, let all dispose their hours<br/>Till midnight, when again we pray your presence.<br/>                                                [_The court retiring_.<br/>(_To_ MYRRHA, _who is going_.)<br/>Myrrha! I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.<br/><br/>_Myr._                                  Great King,<br/>Thou didst not say so.<br/><br/>_Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:<br/>I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,<br/>Which said thou wouldst not leave me.<br/><br/>_Myr._                               Sire! your brother----<br/><br/>_Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!<br/>How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?<br/><br/>_Sar._                                    Not blush!<br/>Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson<br/>Like to the dying day on Caucasus,<br/>Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,<br/>And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,<br/>Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,<br/>And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Curs√©d be he who caused those tears to flow!<br/><br/>_Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember<br/>I am a monarch.<br/><br/>_Sal._          Would thou couldst!<br/><br/>_Myr._                               My sovereign,<br/>I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked<br/>Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect<br/>That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose<br/>An empire than thy presence.                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.<br/><br/>_Sal._                       It may be,<br/>Thou wilt lose both--and both for ever!<br/><br/>_Sar._                                  Brother!<br/>I can at least command myself, who listen<br/>To language such as this: yet urge me not<br/>Beyond my easy nature.<br/><br/>_Sal._                 'Tis beyond<br/>That easy--far too easy--idle nature,<br/>Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee!<br/>Though 'twere against myself.<br/><br/>_Sar._                        By the god Baal!<br/>The man would make me tyrant.<br/><br/>_Sal._                        So thou art.<br/>Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that<br/>Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice,<br/>The weakness and the wickedness of luxury,<br/>The negligence, the apathy, the evils<br/>Of sensual sloth--produce ten thousand tyrants,<br/>Whose delegated cruelty surpasses<br/>The worst acts of one energetic master,<br/>However harsh and hard in his own bearing.<br/>The false and fond examples of thy lusts<br/>Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap<br/>In the same moment all thy pageant power<br/>And those who should sustain it; so that whether<br/>A foreign foe invade, or civil broil<br/>Distract within, both will alike prove fatal:<br/>The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer;<br/>The last they rather would assist than vanquish.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs;<br/>A natural love unto my infant nephews;<br/>Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly,<br/>In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line;<br/>Also, another thing thou knowest not.<br/><br/>_Sar._ What's that?<br/><br/>_Sal._               To thee an unknown word.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                        Yet speak it;<br/>I love to learn.<br/><br/>_Sal._           Virtue.<br/><br/>_Sar._                  Not know the word!<br/>Never was word yet rung so in my ears--<br/>Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet:<br/>I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.<br/><br/>_Sal._ To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice.<br/><br/>_Sar._ From whom?<br/><br/>_Sal._             Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen<br/>Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient,<br/>As thou hast often proved--speak out, what moves thee?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Thy peril.<br/><br/>_Sar._             Say on.<br/><br/>_Sal._                     Thus, then: all the nations,<br/>For they are many, whom thy father left<br/>In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.<br/><br/>_Sar._ 'Gainst _me!!_ What would the slaves?<br/><br/>_Sal._                                         A king.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                                 And what<br/>Am I then?<br/><br/>_Sal._     In their eyes a nothing; but<br/>In mine a man who might be something still.<br/><br/>_Sar._ The railing drunkards! why, what would they have?<br/>Have they not peace and plenty?<br/><br/>_Sal._                          Of the first<br/>More than is glorious: of the last, far less<br/>Than the King recks of.<br/><br/>_Sar._                  Whose then is the crime,<br/>But the false satraps, who provide no better?<br/><br/>_Sal._ And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks<br/>Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs<br/>Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace,<br/>Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal!<br/>Who built up this vast empire, and wert made<br/>A God, or at the least shinest like a God<br/>Through the long centuries of thy renown,<br/>This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld<br/>As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero,<br/>Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril!<br/>For what? to furnish imposts for a revel,<br/>Or multiplied extortions for a minion.<br/><br/>_Sar._ I understand thee--thou wouldst have me go<br/>Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars<br/>Which the Chaldeans read--the restless slaves<br/>Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes,<br/>And lead them forth to glory.<br/><br/>_Sal._                       Wherefore not?<br/>Semiramis--a woman only--led<br/>These our Assyrians to the solar shores<br/>Of Ganges.<br/><br/>_Sar._    Tis most true. And _how_ returned?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Why, like a _man_--a hero; baffled, but<br/>Not vanquished. With but twenty guards, she made<br/>Good her retreat to Bactria.<br/><br/>_Sar._                       And how many<br/>Left she behind in India to the vultures?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Our annals say not.<br/><br/>_Sar._                    Then I will say for them--<br/>That she had better woven within her palace<br/>Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards<br/>Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens,<br/>And wolves, and men--the fiercer of the three,<br/>Her myriads of fond subjects. Is _this_ Glory?<br/>Then let me live in ignominy ever.<br/><br/>_Sal._ All warlike spirits have not the same fate.<br/>Semiramis, the glorious parent of<br/>A hundred kings, although she failed in India,<br/>Brought Persia--Media--Bactria--to the realm<br/>Which she once swayed--and thou _mightst_ sway.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                         _I sway_ them--<br/>She but subdued them.<br/><br/>_Sal._                It may be ere long<br/>That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.<br/><br/>_Sar._ There was a certain Bacchus, was there not?<br/>I've heard my Greek girls speak of such--they say<br/>He was a God, that is, a Grecian god,<br/>An idol foreign to Assyria's worship,<br/>Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind<br/>Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished.<br/><br/>_Sal._ I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st<br/>That he is deemed a God for what he did.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And in his godship I will honour him--<br/>Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!<br/><br/>_Sal._ What means the King?<br/><br/>_Sar._                     To worship your new God<br/>And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say.<br/><br/>                        _Enter Cupbearer_.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_addressing the Cupbearer_).<br/>Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems,<br/>Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence,<br/>Fill full, and bear it quickly.                     [_Exit Cupbearer_.<br/><br/>_Sal._                         Is this moment<br/>A fitting one for the resumption of<br/>Thy yet unslept-off revels?<br/><br/>                 _Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine_.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_taking the cup from him_). Noble kinsman,<br/>If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores<br/>And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus<br/>Conquered the whole of India, did he not?<br/><br/>_Sal._ He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Not so:--of all his conquests a few columns.<br/>Which may be his, and might be mine, if I<br/>Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are<br/>The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed,<br/>The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke.<br/>But here--here in this goblet is his title<br/>To immortality--the immortal grape<br/>From which he first expressed the soul, and gave<br/>To gladden that of man, as some atonement<br/>For the victorious mischiefs he had done.<br/>Had it not been for this, he would have been<br/>A mortal still in name as in his grave;<br/>And, like my ancestor Semiramis,<br/>A sort of semi-glorious human monster.<br/>Here's that which deified him--let it now<br/>Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother,<br/>Pledge me to the Greek God!<br/><br/>_Sal._                      For all thy realms<br/>I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.<br/><br/>_Sar._ That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero,<br/>That he shed blood by oceans; and no God,<br/>Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment,<br/>Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires<br/>The young, makes Weariness forget his toil,<br/>And Fear her danger; opens a new world<br/>When this, the present, palls. Well, then _I_ pledge thee<br/>And _him_ as a true man, who did his utmost<br/>In good or evil to surprise mankind.                        [_Drinks_.<br/><br/>_Sal._ Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?<br/><br/>_Sar._ And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy,<br/>Being bought without a tear. But that is not<br/>My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me,<br/>Continue what thou pleasest.<br/>(_To the Cupbearer_.)       Boy, retire.            [_Exit Cupbearer_.<br/><br/>_Sal._ I would but have recalled thee from thy dream;<br/>Better by me awakened than rebellion.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext?<br/>I am the lawful King, descended from<br/>A race of Kings who knew no predecessors.<br/>What have I done to thee, or to the people,<br/>That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                             But<br/>Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?<br/><br/>_Sal._ _Think!_ Thou hast wronged her!<br/><br/>_Sar._                                Patience, Prince, and hear me.<br/>She has all power and splendour of her station,<br/>Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs,<br/>The homage and the appanage of sovereignty.<br/>I married her as monarchs wed--for state,<br/>And loved her as most husbands love their wives.<br/>If she or thou supposedst I could link me<br/>Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate,<br/>Ye knew nor me--nor monarchs--nor mankind.<br/><br/>_Sal._ I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains<br/>Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not<br/>Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord!<br/>Nor would she deign to accept divided passion<br/>With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves.<br/>The Queen is silent.<br/><br/>_Sar._               And why not her brother?<br/><br/>_Sal._ I only echo thee the voice of empires,<br/>Which he who long neglects not long will govern.<br/><br/>_Sar._ The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur<br/>Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them<br/>To dry into the desert's dust by myriads,<br/>Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges;<br/>Nor decimated them with savage laws,<br/>Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids,<br/>Or Babylonian walls.<br/><br/>_Sal._               Yet these are trophies<br/>More worthy of a people and their prince<br/>Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines,<br/>And lavished treasures, and contemn√©d virtues.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Or for my trophies I have founded cities:<br/>There's Tarsus and Anchialus, both built<br/>In one day--what could that blood-loving beldame,<br/>My martial grandam, chaste Semiramis,<br/>Do more, except destroy them?<br/><br/>_Sal._                        'Tis most true;<br/>I own thy merit in those founded cities,<br/>Built for a whim, recorded with a verse<br/>Which shames both them and thee to coming ages.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Shame me! By Baal, the cities, though well built,<br/>Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what<br/>Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule,<br/>But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record.<br/>Why, those few lines contain the history<br/>Of all things human: hear--"Sardanapalus,<br/>The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,<br/>In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus.<br/>Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip."<br/><br/>_Sal._ A worthy moral, and a wise inscription,<br/>For a king to put up before his subjects!<br/><br/>_Sar._ Oh, thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--<br/>"Obey the king--contribute to his treasure--<br/>Recruit his phalanx--spill your blood at bidding--<br/>Fall down and worship, or get up and toil."<br/>Or thus--"Sardanapalus on this spot<br/>Slew fifty thousand of his enemies.<br/>These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy."<br/>I leave such things to conquerors; enough<br/>For me, if I can make my subjects feel<br/>The weight of human misery less, and glide<br/>Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license<br/>Which I deny to them. We all are men.<br/><br/>_Sal._ Thy Sires have been revered as Gods--<br/><br/>_Sar._                                        In dust<br/>And death, where they are neither Gods nor men.<br/>Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods;<br/>At least they banqueted upon your Gods,<br/>And died for lack of farther nutriment.<br/>Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--<br/>I feel a thousand mortal things about me,<br/>But nothing godlike,--unless it may be<br/>The thing which you condemn, a disposition<br/>To love and to be merciful, to pardon<br/>The follies of my species, and (that's human)<br/>To be indulgent to my own.<br/><br/>_Sal._                    Alas!<br/>The doom of Nineveh is sealed.--Woe--woe<br/>To the unrivalled city!<br/><br/>_Sar._                  What dost dread?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours<br/>The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee,<br/>And thine and mine; and in another day<br/>What _is_ shall be the past of Belus' race.<br/><br/>_Sar._ What must we dread?<br/><br/>_Sal._                    Ambitious treachery,<br/>Which has environed thee with snares; but yet<br/>There is resource: empower me with thy signet<br/>To quell the machinations, and I lay<br/>The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.<br/><br/>_Sar._ The heads--how many?<br/><br/>_Sal._                     Must I stay to number<br/>When even thine own's in peril? Let me go;<br/>Give me thy signet--trust me with the rest.<br/><br/>_Sar._ I will trust no man with unlimited lives.<br/>When we take those from others, we nor know<br/>What we have taken, nor the thing we give.<br/><br/>_Sal._ Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?<br/><br/>_Sar._ That's a hard question--But I answer, Yes.<br/>Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they<br/>Whom thou suspectest?--Let them be arrested.<br/><br/>_Sal._ I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment<br/>Will send my answer through thy babbling troop<br/>Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace,<br/>Even to the city, and so baffle all.--<br/>Trust me.<br/><br/>_Sar._      Thou knowest I have done so ever;<br/>Take thou the signet.                             [_Gives the signet_.<br/><br/>_Sal._                I have one more request.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Name it.<br/><br/>_Sal._           That thou this night forbear the banquet<br/>In the pavilion over the Euphrates.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters<br/>That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come,<br/>And do their worst: I shall not blench for them;<br/>Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet;<br/>Nor crown me with a single rose the less;<br/>Nor lose one joyous hour.--I fear them not.<br/><br/>_Sal._ But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?<br/><br/>_Sar._ Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and<br/>A sword of such a temper, and a bow,<br/>And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth:<br/>A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy.<br/>And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them,<br/>Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--<br/>If need be, wilt thou wear them?<br/><br/>_Sar._                           Will I not?<br/>Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves<br/>Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword<br/>Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.<br/><br/>_Sal._ They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.<br/><br/>_Sar._ That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks,<br/>Of whom our captives often sing, related<br/>The same of their chief hero, Hercules,<br/>Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest<br/>The populace of all the nations seize<br/>Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.<br/><br/>_Sal._ They did not speak thus of thy fathers.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                         No;<br/>They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat;<br/>And never changed their chains but for their armour:<br/>Now they have peace and pastime, and the license<br/>To revel and to rail; it irks me not.<br/>I would not give the smile of one fair girl<br/>For all the popular breath that e'er divided<br/>A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues<br/>Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding,<br/>That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread<br/>Their noisome clamour?<br/><br/>_Sal._                You have said they are men;<br/>As such their hearts are something.<br/><br/>_Sar._                             So my dogs' are;<br/>And better, as more faithful:--but, proceed;<br/>Thou hast my signet:--since they are tumultuous,<br/>Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till<br/>Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain,<br/>Given or received; we have enough within us,<br/>The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,<br/>Not to add to each other's natural burthen<br/>Of mortal misery, but rather lessen,<br/>By mild reciprocal alleviation,<br/>The fatal penalties imposed on life:<br/>But this they know not, or they will not know.<br/>I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them:<br/>I made no wars, I added no new imposts,<br/>I interfered not with their civic lives,<br/>I let them pass their days as best might suit them,<br/>Passing my own as suited me.<br/><br/>_Sal._                       Thou stopp'st<br/>Short of the duties of a king; and therefore<br/>They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.<br/><br/>_Sar._ They lie.--Unhappily, I am unfit<br/>To be aught save a monarch; else for me<br/>The meanest Mede might be the king instead.<br/><br/>_Sal._ There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so.<br/><br/>_Sar._ What mean'st thou!--'tis thy secret; thou desirest<br/>Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature.<br/>Take the fit steps; and, since necessity<br/>Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er<br/>Was man who more desired to rule in peace<br/>The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better<br/>They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes,<br/>"The Mighty Hunter!" I will turn these realms<br/>To one wide desert chase of brutes, who _were_,<br/>But _would_ no more, by their own choice, be human.<br/>_What_ they have found me, they belie; _that which_<br/>They yet may find me--shall defy their wish<br/>To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.<br/><br/>_Sal._ Then thou at last canst feel?<br/><br/>_Sar._                              Feel! who feels not<br/>Ingratitude?<br/><br/>_Sal._      I will not pause to answer<br/>With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy<br/>Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee,<br/>And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign,<br/>As powerful in thy realm. Farewell!                 [_Exit_ SALEMENES.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_solus_).                 Farewell!<br/>He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet,<br/>Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern<br/>As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve<br/>To feel a master. What may be the danger,<br/>I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it.<br/>Must I consume my life--this little life--<br/>In guarding against all may make it less?<br/>It is not worth so much! It were to die<br/>Before my hour, to live in dread of death,<br/>Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me,<br/>Because they are near; and all who are remote,<br/>Because they are far. But if it should be so--<br/>If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire,<br/>Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth?<br/>I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image;<br/>To die is no less natural than those<br/>Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed<br/>Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till<br/>My name became the synonyme of Death--<br/>A terror and a trophy. But for this<br/>I feel no penitence; my life is love:<br/>If I must shed blood, it shall be by force.<br/>Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein<br/>Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin<br/>Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished<br/>On objects which could cost her sons a tear:<br/>If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate not:<br/>If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not.<br/>Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres,<br/>And mowed down like the grass, else all we reap<br/>Is rank abundance, and a rotten harvest<br/>Of discontents infecting the fair soil,<br/>Making a desert of fertility.--<br/>I'll think no more.--Within there, ho!<br/><br/>                      _Enter an_ ATTENDANT.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                Slave, tell<br/>The Ionian Myrrha we would crave her presence.<br/><br/>_Attend._ King, she is here.<br/><br/>                         MYRRHA _enters_.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_apart to Attendant_). Away!<br/><br/>(_Addressing_ MYRRHA.)              Beautiful being!<br/>Thou dost almost anticipate my heart;<br/>It throbbed for thee, and here thou comest: let me<br/>Deem that some unknown influence, some sweet oracle,<br/>Communicates between us, though unseen,<br/>In absence, and attracts us to each other.<br/><br/>_Myr._ There doth.<br/><br/>_Sar._             I know there doth, but not its name:<br/>What is it?<br/><br/>_Myr._       In my native land a God,<br/>And in my heart a feeling like a God's,<br/>Exalted; yet I own 'tis only mortal;<br/>For what I feel is humble, and yet happy--<br/>That is, it would be happy; but----                  [MYRRHA _pauses_.<br/><br/>_Sar._                             There comes<br/>For ever something between us and what<br/>We deem our happiness: let me remove<br/>The barrier which that hesitating accent<br/>Proclaims to thine, and mine is sealed.<br/><br/>_Myr._                                  My Lord!--<br/><br/>_Sar._ My Lord--my King--Sire--Sovereign; thus it is--<br/>For ever thus, addressed with awe. I ne'er<br/>Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's<br/>Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons<br/>Have gorged themselves up to equality,<br/>Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement.<br/>Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names,<br/>Lord--King--Sire--Monarch--nay, time was I prized them;<br/>That is, I suffered them--from slaves and nobles;<br/>But when they falter from the lips I love,<br/>The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill<br/>Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood<br/>Of this my station, which represses feeling<br/>In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me<br/>Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara,<br/>And share a cottage on the Caucasus<br/>With thee--and wear no crowns but those of flowers.<br/><br/>_Myr._ Would that we could!<br/><br/>_Sar._                     And dost _thou_ feel this?--Why?<br/><br/>_Myr._ Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And that is----<br/><br/>_Myr._                  The true value of a heart;<br/>At least, a woman's.<br/><br/>_Sar._               I have proved a thousand--A<br/>thousand, and a thousand.<br/><br/>_Myr._                   Hearts?<br/><br/>_Sar._                          I think so.<br/><br/>_Myr._ Not one! the time may come thou may'st.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                          It will.<br/>Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--<br/>Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus,<br/>Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--<br/>But Salemenes hath declared my throne<br/>In peril.<br/><br/>_Myr._    He did well.<br/><br/>_Sar._                And say'st _thou_ so?<br/>Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared<br/>Drive from our presence with his savage jeers,<br/>And made thee weep and blush?<br/><br/>_Myr._                        I should do both<br/>More frequently, and he did well to call me<br/>Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril<br/>Peril to thee----<br/><br/>_Sar._            Aye, from dark plots and snares<br/>From Medes--and discontented troops and nations.<br/>I know not what--a labyrinth of things--<br/>A maze of muttered threats and mysteries:<br/>Thou know'st the man--it is his usual custom.<br/>But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--<br/>But of the midnight festival.<br/><br/>_Myr._                       'Tis time<br/>To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not<br/>Spurned his sage cautions?<br/><br/>_Sar._                     What?--and dost thou fear?<br/><br/>_Myr._ Fear!--I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death?<br/>A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?<br/><br/>_Sar._ Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?<br/><br/>_Myr._                                         I love.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And do not I? I love thee far--far more<br/>Than either the brief life or the wide realm,<br/>Which, it may be, are menaced;--yet I blench not.<br/><br/>_Myr._ That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me;<br/>For he who loves another loves himself,<br/>Even for that other's sake. This is too rash:<br/>Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Lost!--why, who is the aspiring chief who dared<br/>Assume to win them?<br/><br/>_Myr._             Who is he should dread<br/>To try so much? When he who is their ruler<br/>Forgets himself--will they remember him?<br/><br/>_Sar._ Myrrha!<br/><br/>_Myr._        Frown not upon me: you have smiled<br/>Too often on me not to make those frowns<br/>Bitterer to bear than any punishment<br/>Which they may augur.--King, I am your subject!<br/>Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--<br/>Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness,<br/>Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--<br/>A slave, and hating fetters--an Ionian,<br/>And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more<br/>Degraded by that passion than by chains!<br/>Still I have loved you. If that love were strong<br/>Enough to overcome all former nature,<br/>Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?<br/><br/>_Sar._ _Save_ me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,<br/>And what I seek of thee is love--not safety.<br/><br/>_Myr._ And without love where dwells security?<br/><br/>_Sar._ I speak of woman's love.<br/><br/>_Myr._                         The very first<br/>Of human life must spring from woman's breast,<br/>Your first small words are taught you from her lips,<br/>Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs<br/>Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,<br/>When men have shrunk from the ignoble care<br/>Of watching the last hour of him who led them.<br/><br/>_Sar._ My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music:<br/>The very chorus of the tragic song<br/>I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime<br/>Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee.<br/><br/>_Myr._ I weep not.--But I pray thee, do not speak<br/>About my fathers or their land.<br/><br/>_Sar._                          Yet oft<br/>Thou speakest of them.<br/><br/>_Myr._                 True--true: constant thought<br/>Will overflow in words unconsciously;<br/>But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Well, then, how wouldst thou _save_ me, as thou saidst?<br/><br/>_Myr._ By teaching thee to save thyself, and not<br/>Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all<br/>The rage of the worst war--the war of brethren.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors;<br/>I live in peace and pleasure: what can man<br/>Do more?<br/><br/>_Myr._       Alas! my Lord, with common men<br/>There needs too oft the show of war to keep<br/>The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king,<br/>'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And I have never sought but for the last.<br/><br/>_Myr._ And now art neither.<br/><br/>_Sar._                      Dost _thou_ say so, Myrrha?<br/><br/>_Myr._ I speak of civic popular love, _self_-love,<br/>Which means that men are kept in awe and law,<br/>Yet not oppressed--at least they must not think so,<br/>Or, if they think so, deem it necessary,<br/>To ward off worse oppression, their own passions.<br/>A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel,<br/>And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Glory! what's that?<br/><br/>_Myr._                     Ask of the Gods thy fathers.<br/><br/>_Sar._ They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them,<br/>'Tis for some small addition to the temple.<br/><br/>_Myr._ Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.<br/><br/>_Sar._ They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot.<br/>But what wouldst have? the Empire _has been_ founded.<br/>I cannot go on multiplying empires.<br/><br/>_Myr._ Preserve thine own.<br/><br/>_Sar._                     At least, I will enjoy it.<br/>Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates:<br/>The hour invites, the galley is prepared,<br/>And the pavilion, decked for our return,<br/>In fit adornment for the evening banquet,<br/>Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until<br/>It seems unto the stars which are above us<br/>Itself an opposite star; and we will sit<br/>Crowned with fresh flowers like----<br/><br/>_Myr._                             Victims.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                     No, like sovereigns,<br/>The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times,<br/>Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths,<br/>And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.<br/><br/>                          _Enter_ PANIA.<br/><br/>_Pan._ May the King live for ever!<br/><br/>_Sar._                           Not an hour<br/>Longer than he can love. How my soul hates<br/>This language, which makes life itself a lie,<br/>Flattering dust with eternity. Well, Pania!<br/>Be brief.<br/><br/>_Pan._      I am charged by Salemenes to<br/>Reiterate his prayer unto the King,<br/>That for this day, at least, he will not quit<br/>The palace: when the General returns,<br/>He will adduce such reasons as will warrant<br/>His daring, and perhaps obtain the pardon<br/>Of his presumption.<br/><br/>_Sar._               What! am I then cooped?<br/>Already captive? can I not even breathe<br/>The breath of heaven? Tell prince Salemenes,<br/>Were all Assyria raging round the walls<br/>In mutinous myriads, I would still go forth.<br/><br/>_Pan._ I must obey, and yet----<br/><br/>_Myr._                        Oh, Monarch, listen.--<br/>How many a day and moon thou hast reclined<br/>Within these palace walls in silken dalliance,<br/>And never shown thee to thy people's longing;<br/>Leaving thy subjects' eyes ungratified,<br/>The satraps uncontrolled, the Gods unworshipped,<br/>And all things in the anarchy of sloth,<br/>Till all, save evil, slumbered through the realm!<br/>And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--<br/>A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not<br/>Yield to the few still faithful a few hours,<br/>For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race,<br/>And for thy sons' inheritance?<br/><br/>_Pan._                         'Tis true!<br/>From the deep urgency with which the Prince<br/>Despatched me to your sacred presence, I<br/>Must dare to add my feeble voice to that<br/>Which now has spoken.<br/><br/>_Sar._               No, it must not be.<br/><br/>_Myr._ For the sake of thy realm!<br/><br/>_Sar._                             Away!<br/><br/>_Pan._                                 For that<br/>Of all thy faithful subjects, who will rally<br/>Round thee and thine.<br/><br/>_Sar._               These are mere fantasies:<br/>There is no peril:--'tis a sullen scheme<br/>Of Salemenes, to approve his zeal,<br/>And show himself more necessary to us.<br/><br/>_Myr._ By all that's good and glorious take this counsel.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Business to-morrow.<br/><br/>_Myr._                    Aye--or death to-night.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Why let it come then unexpectedly,<br/>'Midst joy and gentleness, and mirth and love;<br/>So let me fall like the plucked rose!--far better<br/>Thus than be withered.<br/><br/>_Myr._                 Then thou wilt not yield,<br/>Even for the sake of all that ever stirred<br/>A monarch into action, to forego<br/>A trifling revel.<br/><br/>_Sar._            No.<br/><br/>_Myr._               Then yield for _mine_;<br/>For my sake!<br/><br/>_Sar._      Thine, my Myrrha!<br/><br/>_Myr._                      'Tis the first<br/>Boon which I ever asked Assyria's king.<br/><br/>_Sar._ That's true, and, wer't my kingdom, must be granted.<br/>Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence!<br/>Thou hear'st me.<br/><br/>_Pan._           And obey.                              [_Exit_ PANIA.<br/><br/>_Sar._                    I marvel at thee.<br/>What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?<br/><br/>_Myr._ Thy safety; and the certainty that nought<br/>Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require<br/>Thus much from thee, but some impending danger.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?<br/><br/>_Myr._ Because _thou_ dost not fear, I fear for _thee_.<br/><br/>_Sar._ To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.<br/><br/>_Myr._ If the worst come, I shall be where none weep,<br/>And that is better than the power to smile.<br/>And thou?<br/><br/>_Sar._    I shall be King, as heretofore.<br/><br/>_Myr._ Where?<br/><br/>_Sar._         With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis,<br/>Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere.<br/>Fate made me what I am--may make me nothing--<br/>But either that or nothing must I be:<br/>I will not live degraded.<br/><br/>_Myr._                    Hadst thou felt<br/>Thus always, none would ever dare degrade thee.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And who will do so now?<br/><br/>_Myr._                        Dost thou suspect none?<br/><br/>_Sar._ Suspect!--that's a spy's office. Oh! we lose<br/>Ten thousand precious moments in vain words,<br/>And vainer fears. Within there!--ye slaves, deck<br/>The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel;<br/>If I must make a prison of our palace,<br/>At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly;<br/>If the Euphrates be forbid us, and<br/>The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border,<br/>Here we are still unmenaced.

[_Exit_.<br/><br/>ACT II.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_The Portal of the same Hall of the Palace_.<br/><br/>_Beleses_ (_solus_).<br/>The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,<br/>Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire.<br/>How red he glares amongst those deepening clouds,<br/>Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain,<br/>Thou Sun that sinkest, and ye stars which rise,<br/>I have outwatched ye, reading ray by ray<br/>The edicts of your orbs, which make Time tremble<br/>For what he brings the nations, 'tis the furthest<br/>Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm!<br/>An earthquake should announce so great a fall--<br/>A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk,<br/>To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon<br/>Its everlasting page the end of what<br/>Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun!<br/>The burning oracle of all that live,<br/>As fountain of all life, and symbol of<br/>Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit<br/>Thy lore unto calamity? Why not<br/>Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine<br/>All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart<br/>A beam of hope athwart the future years,<br/>As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!<br/>I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant--<br/>I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,<br/>And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams,<br/>When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched<br/>For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee,<br/>And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee,<br/>And asked of thee, and thou hast answered--but<br/>Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks--<br/>Is gone--and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,<br/>To the delighted West, which revels in<br/>Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is<br/>Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset;<br/>And mortals may be happy to resemble<br/>The Gods but in decay.<br/><br/>                _Enter_ ARBACES _by an inner door_.<br/><br/>_Arb._                Beleses, why<br/>So wrapt in thy devotions?

Meantime<br/>I have prepared as many glittering spears<br/>As will out-sparkle our allies--your planets.<br/>There is no more to thwart us.

A fool reigning,<br/>His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:<br/>Why, it is _his_ revenge we work for.<br/><br/>_Bel._                               Could<br/>He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.<br/><br/>_Arb._ What, if we sound him?<br/><br/>_Bel._                       Yes--if the time served.<br/><br/>                          _Enter_ BALEA.<br/><br/>_Bal._ Satraps!

Slain, Sire!<br/>An arrow pierced his brain, while, scattering<br/>The last drops from his helm, he stood in act<br/>To place it on his brows.<br/><br/>_Sar._                   Slain! unrewarded!<br/>And slain to serve my thirst: that's hard, poor slave!<br/>Had he but lived, I would have gorged him with<br/>Gold: all the gold of earth could ne'er repay<br/>The pleasure of that draught; for I was parched<br/>As I am now.

I paused<br/>To look upon her, and her kindled cheek;<br/>Her large black eyes, that flashed through her long hair<br/>As it streamed o'er her; her blue veins that rose<br/>Along her most transparent brow; her nostril<br/>Dilated from its symmetry; her lips<br/>Apart; her voice that clove through all the din,<br/>As a lute pierceth through the cymbal's clash,<br/>Jarred but not drowned by the loud brattling; her<br/>Waved arms, more dazzling with their own born whiteness<br/>Than the steel her hand held, which she caught up<br/>From a dead soldier's grasp;--all these things made<br/>Her seem unto the troops a prophetess<br/>Of victory, or Victory herself,<br/>Come down to hail us hers.<br/><br/>_Sal._ (_aside_).           This is too much.<br/>Again the love-fit's on him, and all's lost,<br/>Unless we turn his thoughts. (_Aloud_.) But pray thee, Sire,<br/>Think of your wound--you said even now 'twas painful.<br/><br/>_Sar._ That's true, too; but I must not think of it.<br/><br/>_Sal._ I have looked to all things needful, and will now<br/>Receive reports of progress made in such<br/>Orders as I had given, and then return<br/>To hear your further pleasure.<br/><br/>_Sar._                         Be it so.<br/><br/>_Sal._ (_in retiring_). Myrrha!<br/><br/>_Myr._                         Prince!<br/><br/>_Sal._         You have shown a soul to-night,<br/>Which, were he not my sister's lord----But now<br/>I have no time: thou lovest the King?<br/><br/>_Myr._                               I love<br/>Sardanapalus.<br/><br/>_Sal._         But wouldst have him King still?<br/><br/>_Myr._ I would not have him less than what he should be.<br/><br/>_Sal._ Well then, to have him King, and yours, and all<br/>He should, or should not be; to have him _live_,<br/>Let him not sink back into luxury.<br/>You have more power upon his spirit than<br/>Wisdom within these walls, or fierce rebellion<br/>Raging without: look well that he relapse not.<br/><br/>_Myr._ There needed not the voice of Salemenes<br/>To urge me on to this: I will not fail.<br/>All that a woman's weakness can----<br/><br/>_Sal._                               Is power<br/>Omnipotent o'er such a heart as his:<br/>Exert it wisely.

I must not<br/>Hear those sweet lips grow eloquent in aught<br/>That throws me into shade; yet you speak truth.<br/><br/>_Myr._ And now retire, to have your wound looked to,<br/>Pray lean on me.<br/><br/>_Sar._          Yes, love! but not from pain.<br/>                                                      [_Exeunt omnes_.<br/><br/>ACT IV.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--SARDANAPALUS _discovered sleeping upon a<br/>        Couch, and occasionally disturbed in his slumbers,<br/>                     with_ MYRRHA _watching_.<br/><br/>_Myr._ (_sola, gazing_).<br/>I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be,<br/>Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him?<br/>No, he seems calmer.

It seems pain; but if<br/>I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever<br/>Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of<br/>His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake<br/>Me more to see than him to suffer. No:<br/>Let Nature use her own maternal means,<br/>And I await to second, not disturb her.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_awakening_).<br/>Not so--although he multiplied the stars,<br/>And gave them to me as a realm to share<br/>From you and with you!

Hence--hence--<br/>Old Hunter of the earliest brutes! and ye,<br/>Who hunted fellow-creatures as if brutes!<br/>Once bloody mortals--and now bloodier idols,<br/>If your priests lie not! And thou, ghastly Beldame!<br/>Dripping with dusky gore, and trampling on<br/>The carcasses of Inde--away! away!<br/>Where am I? Where the spectres? Where--No--that<br/>Is no false phantom: I should know it 'midst<br/>All that the dead dare gloomily raise up<br/>From their black gulf to daunt the living. Myrrha!<br/><br/>_Myr._ Alas! thou art pale, and on thy brow the drops<br/>Gather like night dew. My beloved, hush--<br/>Calm thee. Thy speech seems of another world,<br/>And thou art lord of this.

If there be indeed<br/>A shore where Mind survives, 'twill be as Mind<br/>All unincorporate: or if there flits<br/>A shadow of this cumbrous clog of clay.<br/>Which stalks, methinks, between our souls and heaven,<br/>And fetters us to earth--at least the phantom,<br/>Whate'er it have to fear, will not fear Death.<br/><br/>_Sar._ I fear it not; but I have felt--have seen--<br/>A legion of the dead.<br/><br/>_Myr._                And so have I.<br/>The dust we tread upon was once alive,<br/>And wretched.

But----                      [_He pauses_.<br/><br/>_Myr._                           What instead?<br/><br/>_Sar._ In thy own chair--thy own place in the banquet--<br/>I sought thy sweet face in the circle--but<br/>Instead--a grey-haired, withered, bloody-eyed,<br/>And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing,<br/>Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow,<br/>Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion<br/>Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust,<br/>Sate:--my veins curdled.<br/><br/>_Myr._                Is this all?<br/><br/>_Sar._                              Upon<br/>Her right hand--her lank, bird-like, right hand--stood<br/>A goblet, bubbling o'er with blood; and on<br/>Her left, another, filled with--what I saw not,<br/>But turned from it and her. But all along<br/>The table sate a range of crown√©d wretches,<br/>Of various aspects, but of one expression.<br/><br/>_Myr._ And felt you not this a mere vision?<br/><br/>_Sar._                                        No:<br/>It was so palpable, I could have touched them.<br/>I turned from one face to another, in<br/>The hope to find at last one which I knew<br/>Ere I saw theirs: but no--all turned upon me,<br/>And stared, but neither ate nor drank, but stared,<br/>Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be,<br/>Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them,<br/>And life in me: there was a horrid kind<br/>Of sympathy between us, as if they<br/>Had lost a part of death to come to me,<br/>And I the half of life to sit by them.<br/>We were in an existence all apart<br/>From heaven or earth----And rather let me see<br/>Death all than such a being!<br/><br/>_Myr._                       And the end?<br/><br/>_Sar._ At last I sate, marble, as they, when rose<br/>The Hunter and the Crone; and smiling on me--<br/>Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of<br/>The Hunter smiled upon me--I should say,<br/>His lips, for his eyes moved not--and the woman's<br/>Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile.<br/>Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand<br/>Rose also, as if aping their chief shades--<br/>Mere mimics even in death--but I sate still:<br/>A desperate courage crept through every limb,<br/>And at the last I feared them not, but laughed<br/>Full in their phantom faces. But then--then<br/>The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it,<br/>And grasped it--but it melted from my own;<br/>While he too vanished, and left nothing but<br/>The memory of a hero, for he looked so.<br/><br/>_Myr._ And was: the ancestor of heroes, too,<br/>And thine no less.<br/><br/>_Sar._             Aye, Myrrha, but the woman,<br/>The female who remained, she flew upon me,<br/>And burnt my lips up with her noisome kisses;<br/>And, flinging down the goblets on each hand,<br/>Methought their poisons flowed around us, till<br/>Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung;<br/>The other phantoms, like a row of statues,<br/>Stood dull as in our temples, but she still<br/>Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if,<br/>In lieu of her remote descendant, I<br/>Had been the son who slew her for her incest.<br/>Then--then--a chaos of all loathsome things<br/>Thronged thick and shapeless: I was dead, yet feeling--<br/>Buried, and raised again--consumed by worms,<br/>Purged by the flames, and withered in the air!<br/>I can fix nothing further of my thoughts,<br/>Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee,<br/>In all these agonies,--and woke and found thee.<br/><br/>_Myr._ So shalt thou find me ever at thy side,<br/>Here and hereafter, if the last may be.<br/>But think not of these things--the mere creations<br/>Of late events, acting upon a frame<br/>Unused by toil, yet over-wrought by toil--<br/>Such as might try the sternest.<br/><br/>_Sar._                          I am better.<br/>Now that I see thee once more, _what was seen_<br/>Seems nothing.<br/><br/>                        _Enter_ SALEMENES.<br/><br/>_Sal._             Is the king so soon awake?<br/><br/>_Sar._ Yes, brother, and I would I had not slept;<br/>For all the predecessors of our line<br/>Rose up, methought, to drag me down to them.<br/>My father was amongst them, too; but he,<br/>I know not why, kept from me, leaving me<br/>Between the hunter-founder of our race,<br/>And her, the homicide and husband-killer,<br/>Whom you call glorious.<br/><br/>_Sal._                  So I term you also,<br/>Now you have shown a spirit like to hers.<br/>By day-break I propose that we set forth,<br/>And charge once more the rebel crew, who still<br/>Keep gathering head, repulsed, but not quite quelled.<br/><br/>_Sar._ How wears the night?<br/><br/>_Sal._                     There yet remain some hours<br/>Of darkness: use them for your further rest.<br/><br/>_Sar._ No, not to-night, if 'tis not gone: methought<br/>I passed hours in that vision.<br/><br/>_Myr._                         Scarcely one;<br/>I watched by you: it was a heavy hour,<br/>But an hour only.<br/><br/>_Sar._             Let us then hold council;<br/>To-morrow we set forth.<br/><br/>_Sal._                 But ere that time,<br/>I had a grace to seek.<br/><br/>_Sar._                'Tis granted.<br/><br/>_Sal._                             Hear it<br/>Ere you reply too readily; and 'tis<br/>For _your_ ear only.<br/><br/>_Myr._              Prince, I take my leave.<br/>                                                         [Exit MYRRHA.<br/><br/>_Sal._ That slave deserves her freedom.<br/><br/>_Sar._                                 Freedom only!<br/>That slave deserves to share a throne.<br/><br/>_Sal._                                 Your patience--<br/>'Tis not yet vacant, and 'tis of its partner<br/>I come to speak with you.<br/><br/>_Sar._                   How! of the Queen?<br/><br/>_Sal._ Even so.

I will grant<br/>Aught--all that she can ask--but such a meeting.<br/><br/>_Sal._ You know, or ought to know, enough of women,<br/>Since you have studied them so steadily,<br/>That what they ask in aught that touches on<br/>The heart, is dearer to their feelings or<br/>Their fancy, than the whole external world.<br/>I think as you do of my sister's wish;<br/>But 'twas her wish--she is my sister--you<br/>Her husband--will you grant it?<br/><br/>_Sar._                         'Twill be useless:<br/>But let her come.<br/><br/>_Sal._            I go.

Now it bears an aspect!<br/>How say you, Pania, will this pile suffice<br/>For a King's obsequies?<br/><br/>_Pan._                 Aye, for a kingdom's.<br/>I understand you, now.<br/><br/>_Sar._                And blame me?<br/><br/>_Pan._                             No--<br/>Let me but fire the pile, and share it with you.<br/><br/>_Myr._ That _duty's_ mine.<br/><br/>_Pan._                    A woman's!<br/><br/>_Myr._                              'Tis the soldier's<br/>Part to die _for_ his sovereign, and why not<br/>The woman's with her lover?<br/><br/>_Pan._                     'Tis most strange!<br/><br/>_Myr._ But not so rare, my Pania, as thou think'st it.<br/>In the mean time, live thou.--Farewell! the pile<br/>Is ready.<br/><br/>_Pan._     I should shame to leave my sovereign<br/>With but a single female to partake<br/>His death.<br/><br/>_Sar._     Too many far have heralded<br/>Me to the dust already. Get thee hence;<br/>Enrich thee.<br/><br/>_Pan._      And live wretched!<br/><br/>_Sar._                        Think upon<br/>Thy vow:--'tis sacred and irrevocable.<br/><br/>_Pan._ Since it is so, farewell.<br/><br/>_Sar._                            Search well my chamber,<br/>Feel no remorse at bearing off the gold;<br/>Remember, what you leave you leave the slaves<br/>Who slew me: and when you have borne away<br/>All safe off to your boats, blow one long blast<br/>Upon the trumpet as you quit the palace.<br/>The river's brink is too remote, its stream<br/>Too loud at present to permit the echo<br/>To reach distinctly from its banks. Then fly,--<br/>And as you sail, turn back; but still keep on<br/>Your way along the Euphrates: if you reach<br/>The land of Paphlagonia, where the Queen<br/>Is safe with my three sons in Cotta's court,<br/>Say what you _saw_ at parting, and request<br/>That she remember what I _said_ at one<br/>Parting more mournful still.<br/><br/>_Pan._                      That royal hand!<br/>Let me then once more press it to my lips;<br/>And these poor soldiers who throng round you, and<br/>Would fain die with you!<br/><br/>                         [_The Soldiers and_ PANIA _throng round him,<br/>                           kissing his hand and the hem of his robe_.<br/><br/>_Sar._                    My best! my last friends!<br/>Let's not unman each other: part at once:<br/>All farewells should be sudden, when for ever,<br/>Else they make an eternity of moments,<br/>And clog the last sad sands of life with tears.<br/>Hence, and be happy: trust me, I am not<br/>_Now_ to be pitied; or far more for what<br/>Is past than present;--for the future, 'tis<br/>In the hands of the deities, if such<br/>There be: I shall know soon. Farewell--Farewell.<br/>                                       [_Exeunt_ PANIA _and Soldiers_.<br/><br/>_Myr._ These men were honest: it is comfort still<br/>That our last looks should be on loving faces.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And _lovely_ ones, my beautiful!--but hear me!<br/>If at this moment,--for we now are on<br/>The brink,--thou feel'st an inward shrinking from<br/>This leap through flame into the future, say it:<br/>I shall not love thee less; nay, perhaps more,<br/>For yielding to thy nature: and there's time<br/>Yet for thee to escape hence.<br/><br/>_Myr._                      Shall I light<br/>One of the torches which lie heaped beneath<br/>The ever-burning lamp that burns without,<br/>Before Baal's shrine, in the adjoining hall?<br/><br/>_Sar._ Do so. Is that thy answer?<br/><br/>_Myr._                             Thou shalt see.<br/>                                                       [_Exit_ MYRRHA.<br/><br/>_Sar._ (_solus_). She's firm. My fathers! whom I will rejoin,<br/>It may be, purified by death from some<br/>Of the gross stains of too material being,<br/>I would not leave your ancient first abode<br/>To the defilement of usurping bondmen;<br/>If I have not kept your inheritance<br/>As ye bequeathed it, this bright part of it,<br/>Your treasure--your abode--your sacred relics<br/>Of arms, and records--monuments, and spoils,<br/>In which _they_ would have revelled, I bear with me<br/>To you in that absorbing element,<br/>Which most personifies the soul as leaving<br/>The least of matter unconsumed before<br/>Its fiery workings:--and the light of this<br/>Most royal of funereal pyres shall be<br/>Not a mere pillar formed of cloud and flame,<br/>A beacon in the horizon for a day,<br/>And then a mount of ashes--but a light<br/>To lesson ages, rebel nations, and<br/>Voluptuous princes. Time shall quench full many<br/>A people's records, and a hero's acts;<br/>Sweep empire after empire, like this first<br/>Of empires, into nothing; but even then<br/>Shall spare this deed of mine, and hold it up<br/>A problem few dare imitate, and none<br/>Despise--but, it may be, avoid the life<br/>Which led to such a consummation.<br/><br/>        MYRRHA _returns with a lighted Torch in one Hand,<br/>                     and a Cup in the other_.<br/><br/>_Myr._                           Lo!<br/>I've lit the lamp which lights us to the stars.<br/><br/>_Sar._ And the cup?<br/><br/>_Myr._              'Tis my country's custom to<br/>Make a libation to the Gods.<br/><br/>_Sar._                     And mine<br/>To make libations amongst men.

A single thought yet irks me.<br/><br/>_Sar._ Say it.<br/><br/>_Myr._         It is that no kind hand will gather<br/>The dust of both into one urn.<br/><br/>_Sar._                     The better:<br/>Rather let them be borne abroad upon<br/>The winds of heaven, and scattered into air,<br/>Than be polluted more by human hands<br/>Of slaves and traitors. In this blazing palace,<br/>And its enormous walls of reeking ruin,<br/>We leave a nobler monument than Egypt<br/>Hath piled in her brick mountains, o'er dead kings,<br/>Or _kine_--for none know whether those proud piles<br/>Be for their monarch, or their ox-god Apis:<br/>So much for monuments that have forgotten<br/>Their very record!<br/><br/>_Myr._            Then farewell, thou earth!<br/>And loveliest spot of earth! farewell, Ionia!<br/>Be thou still free and beautiful, and far<br/>Aloof from desolation!
