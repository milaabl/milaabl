# üíÆ In My Solitary Hours in My Dear Husband his Absence by *Anne Bradstreet*

<p>
    O Lord, Thou hear'st my daily moan<br/>And see'st my dropping tears.<br/>My troubles all are Thee before,<br/>My longings and my fears.<br/><br/>Thou hitherto hast been my God;<br/>Thy help my soul hath found.<br/>Though loss and sickness me assailed,<br/>Through Thee I've kept my ground.<br/><br/>And Thy abode Thou'st made with me;<br/>With Thee my soul can talk;<br/>In secret places Thee I find<br/>Where I do kneel or walk.<br/><br/>Though husband dear be from me gone,<br/>Whom I do love so well,<br/>I have a more beloved one<br/>Whose comforts far excel.<br/><br/>O stay my heart on Thee. my God,<br/>Uphold my fainting soul.<br/>And when I know not what to do,<br/>I'll on Thy mercies roll.<br/><br/>My weakness. Thou dost know full well<br/>Of body and of mind;<br/>I in this world no comfort have,<br/>But what from Thee I find.<br/><br/>Though children Thou has given me,<br/>And friends I have also,<br/>Yet if I see Thee not through them<br/>They are no joy, but woe.<br/><br/>O shine upon me, blessed Lord,<br/>Ev'n for my Saviour's sake;<br/>In Thee alone is more than all,<br/>And there content I'll take.<br/><br/>O hear me, Lord, in this request<br/>As Thou before hast done,<br/>Bring back my husband, I beseech,<br/>As Thou didst once my son.<br/><br/>So shall I celebrate Thy praise<br/>Ev'n while my days shall last<br/>And talk to my beloved one<br/>Of all Thy goodness past.<br/><br/>So both of us Thy kindness, Lord,<br/>With praises shall recount<br/>And serve Thee better than before<br/>Whose blessings thus surmount.<br/><br/>But give me, Lord, a better heart,<br/>Then better shall I be,<br/>To pay the vows which I do owe<br/>Forever unto Thee.<br/><br/>Unless Thou help, what can I do<br/>But still my frailty show?<br/>If Thou assist me, Lord,<br/>I shall Return Thee what I owe.
</p>
