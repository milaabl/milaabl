# üíÆ The Marriage Of Geraint by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,<br/>A tributary prince of Devon, one<br/>Of that great Order of the Table Round,<br/>Had married Enid, Yniol's only child,<br/>And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.<br/>And as the light of Heaven varies, now<br/>At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night<br/>With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint<br/>To make her beauty vary day by day,<br/>In crimsons and in purples and in gems.<br/>And Enid, but to please her husband's eye,<br/>Who first had found and loved her in a state<br/>Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him<br/>In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,<br/>Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,<br/>Loved her, and often with her own white hands<br/>Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,<br/>Next after her own self, in all the court.<br/>And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart<br/>Adored her, as the stateliest and the best<br/>And loveliest of all women upon earth.<br/>And seeing them so tender and so close,<br/>Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.<br/>But when a rumour rose about the Queen,<br/>Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,<br/>Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard<br/>The world's loud whisper breaking into storm,<br/>Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell<br/>A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,<br/>Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,<br/>Had suffered, or should suffer any taint<br/>In nature: wherefore going to the King,<br/>He made this pretext, that his princedom lay<br/>Close on the borders of a territory,<br/>Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,<br/>Assassins, and all flyers from the hand<br/>Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:<br/>And therefore, till the King himself should please<br/>To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,<br/>He craved a fair permission to depart,<br/>And there defend his marches; and the King<br/>Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,<br/>Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,<br/>And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores<br/>Of Severn, and they past to their own land;<br/>Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife<br/>True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,<br/>He compassed her with sweet observances<br/>And worship, never leaving her, and grew<br/>Forgetful of his promise to the King,<br/>Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,<br/>Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,<br/>Forgetful of his glory and his name,<br/>Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.<br/>And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.<br/>And by and by the people, when they met<br/>In twos and threes, or fuller companies,<br/>Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him<br/>As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,<br/>And molten down in mere uxoriousness.<br/>And this she gathered from the people's eyes:<br/>This too the women who attired her head,<br/>To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,<br/>Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:<br/>And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,<br/>But could not out of bashful delicacy;<br/>While he that watched her sadden, was the more<br/>Suspicious that her nature had a taint.<br/><br/>At last, it chanced that on a summer morn<br/>(They sleeping each by either) the new sun<br/>Beat through the blindless casement of the room,<br/>And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;<br/>Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,<br/>And bared the knotted column of his throat,<br/>The massive square of his heroic breast,<br/>And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,<br/>As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,<br/>Running too vehemently to break upon it.<br/>And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,<br/>Admiring him, and thought within herself,<br/>Was ever man so grandly made as he?<br/>Then, like a shadow, past the people's talk<br/>And accusation of uxoriousness<br/>Across her mind, and bowing over him,<br/>Low to her own heart piteously she said:<br/><br/>'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,<br/>Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men<br/>Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?<br/>I AM the cause, because I dare not speak<br/>And tell him what I think and what they say.<br/>And yet I hate that he should linger here;<br/>I cannot love my lord and not his name.<br/>Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,<br/>And ride with him to battle and stand by,<br/>And watch his mightful hand striking great blows<br/>At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.<br/>Far better were I laid in the dark earth,<br/>Not hearing any more his noble voice,<br/>Not to be folded more in these dear arms,<br/>And darkened from the high light in his eyes,<br/>Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.<br/>Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,<br/>And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,<br/>And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,<br/>And yet not dare to tell him what I think,<br/>And how men slur him, saying all his force<br/>Is melted into mere effeminacy?<br/>O me, I fear that I am no true wife.'<br/><br/>Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,<br/>And the strong passion in her made her weep<br/>True tears upon his broad and naked breast,<br/>And these awoke him, and by great mischance<br/>He heard but fragments of her later words,<br/>And that she feared she was not a true wife.<br/>And then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,<br/>For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,<br/>She is not faithful to me, and I see her<br/>Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'<br/>Then though he loved and reverenced her too much<br/>To dream she could be guilty of foul act,<br/>Right through his manful breast darted the pang<br/>That makes a man, in the sweet face of her<br/>Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.<br/>At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,<br/>And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,<br/>'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,<br/>'I will ride forth into the wilderness;<br/>For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,<br/>I have not fallen so low as some would wish.<br/>And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress<br/>And ride with me.' And Enid asked, amazed,<br/>'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'<br/>But he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'<br/>Then she bethought her of a faded silk,<br/>A faded mantle and a faded veil,<br/>And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,<br/>Wherein she kept them folded reverently<br/>With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,<br/>She took them, and arrayed herself therein,<br/>Remembering when first he came on her<br/>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,<br/>And all her foolish fears about the dress,<br/>And all his journey to her, as himself<br/>Had told her, and their coming to the court.<br/><br/>For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before<br/>Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.<br/>There on a day, he sitting high in hall,<br/>Before him came a forester of Dean,<br/>Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart<br/>Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,<br/>First seen that day: these things he told the King.<br/>Then the good King gave order to let blow<br/>His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.<br/>And when the King petitioned for his leave<br/>To see the hunt, allowed it easily.<br/>So with the morning all the court were gone.<br/>But Guinevere lay late into the morn,<br/>Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love<br/>For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;<br/>But rose at last, a single maiden with her,<br/>Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;<br/>There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed<br/>Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead<br/>A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,<br/>Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress<br/>Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,<br/>Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford<br/>Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.<br/>A purple scarf, at either end whereof<br/>There swung an apple of the purest gold,<br/>Swayed round about him, as he galloped up<br/>To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly<br/>In summer suit and silks of holiday.<br/>Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,<br/>Sweet and statelily, and with all grace<br/>Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:<br/>'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'<br/>'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late<br/>That I but come like you to see the hunt,<br/>Not join it.' 'Therefore wait with me,' she said;<br/>'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,<br/>There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:<br/>Here often they break covert at our feet.'<br/><br/>And while they listened for the distant hunt,<br/>And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,<br/>King Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode<br/>Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;<br/>Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight<br/>Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,<br/>Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.<br/>And Guinevere, not mindful of his face<br/>In the King's hall, desired his name, and sent<br/>Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;<br/>Who being vicious, old and irritable,<br/>And doubling all his master's vice of pride,<br/>Made answer sharply that she should not know.<br/>'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.<br/>'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;<br/>'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'<br/>And when she put her horse toward the knight,<br/>Struck at her with his whip, and she returned<br/>Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint<br/>Exclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'<br/>Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,<br/>Who answered as before; and when the Prince<br/>Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,<br/>Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.<br/>The Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,<br/>Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand<br/>Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:<br/>But he, from his exceeding manfulness<br/>And pure nobility of temperament,<br/>Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained<br/>From even a word, and so returning said:<br/><br/>'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,<br/>Done in your maiden's person to yourself:<br/>And I will track this vermin to their earths:<br/>For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt<br/>To find, at some place I shall come at, arms<br/>On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,<br/>Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,<br/>And on the third day will again be here,<br/>So that I be not fallen in fight. Farewell.'<br/><br/>'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.<br/>'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;<br/>And may you light on all things that you love,<br/>And live to wed with her whom first you love:<br/>But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,<br/>And I, were she the daughter of a king,<br/>Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,<br/>Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'<br/><br/>And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard<br/>The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,<br/>A little vext at losing of the hunt,<br/>A little at the vile occasion, rode,<br/>By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade<br/>And valley, with fixt eye following the three.<br/>At last they issued from the world of wood,<br/>And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,<br/>And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.<br/>And thither there came Geraint, and underneath<br/>Beheld the long street of a little town<br/>In a long valley, on one side whereof,<br/>White from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;<br/>And on one side a castle in decay,<br/>Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:<br/>And out of town and valley came a noise<br/>As of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed<br/>Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks<br/>At distance, ere they settle for the night.<br/><br/>And onward to the fortress rode the three,<br/>And entered, and were lost behind the walls.<br/>'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'<br/>And down the long street riding wearily,<br/>Found every hostel full, and everywhere<br/>Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss<br/>And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured<br/>His master's armour; and of such a one<br/>He asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'<br/>Who told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'<br/>Then riding close behind an ancient churl,<br/>Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,<br/>Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,<br/>Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?<br/>Who answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'<br/>Then riding further past an armourer's,<br/>Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,<br/>Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,<br/>He put the self-same query, but the man<br/>Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:<br/>'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk<br/>Has little time for idle questioners.'<br/>Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:<br/>'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!<br/>Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!<br/>Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg<br/>The murmur of the world! What is it to me?<br/>O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,<br/>Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!<br/>Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,<br/>Where can I get me harbourage for the night?<br/>And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy? Speak!'<br/>Whereat the armourer turning all amazed<br/>And seeing one so gay in purple silks,<br/>Came forward with the helmet yet in hand<br/>And answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;<br/>We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,<br/>And there is scantly time for half the work.<br/>Arms? truth! I know not: all are wanted here.<br/>Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,<br/>It may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge<br/>Yonder.' He spoke and fell to work again.<br/><br/>Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,<br/>Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.<br/>There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,<br/>(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,<br/>Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:<br/>'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,<br/>'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'<br/>Then Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake<br/>The slender entertainment of a house<br/>Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'<br/>'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;<br/>'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks<br/>For supper, I will enter, I will eat<br/>With all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'<br/>Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,<br/>And answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine<br/>To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:<br/>But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,<br/>We will not touch upon him even in jest.'<br/><br/>Then rode Geraint into the castle court,<br/>His charger trampling many a prickly star<br/>Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.<br/>He looked and saw that all was ruinous.<br/>Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;<br/>And here had fallen a great part of a tower,<br/>Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,<br/>And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:<br/>And high above a piece of turret stair,<br/>Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound<br/>Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems<br/>Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,<br/>And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked<br/>A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.<br/><br/>And while he waited in the castle court,<br/>The voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang<br/>Clear through the open casement of the hall,<br/>Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,<br/>Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,<br/>Moves him to think what kind of bird it is<br/>That sings so delicately clear, and make<br/>Conjecture of the plumage and the form;<br/>So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;<br/>And made him like a man abroad at morn<br/>When first the liquid note beloved of men<br/>Comes flying over many a windy wave<br/>To Britain, and in April suddenly<br/>Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,<br/>And he suspends his converse with a friend,<br/>Or it may be the labour of his hands,<br/>To think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'<br/>So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,<br/>'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'<br/><br/>It chanced the song that Enid sang was one<br/>Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:<br/><br/>'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;<br/>Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;<br/>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.<br/><br/>'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;<br/>With that wild wheel we go not up or down;<br/>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.<br/><br/>'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;<br/>Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;<br/>For man is man and master of his fate.<br/><br/>'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;<br/>Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;<br/>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'<br/><br/>'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'<br/>Said Yniol; 'enter quickly.' Entering then,<br/>Right o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,<br/>The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,<br/>He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;<br/>And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,<br/>That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,<br/>Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,<br/>Her daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,<br/>'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'<br/>But none spake word except the hoary Earl:<br/>'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;<br/>Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then<br/>Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;<br/>And we will make us merry as we may.<br/>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'<br/><br/>He spake: the Prince, as Enid past him, fain<br/>To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught<br/>His purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!<br/>Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,<br/>Endures not that her guest should serve himself.'<br/>And reverencing the custom of the house<br/>Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.<br/><br/>So Enid took his charger to the stall;<br/>And after went her way across the bridge,<br/>And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl<br/>Yet spoke together, came again with one,<br/>A youth, that following with a costrel bore<br/>The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.<br/>And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,<br/>And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.<br/>And then, because their hall must also serve<br/>For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,<br/>And stood behind, and waited on the three.<br/>And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,<br/>Geraint had longing in him evermore<br/>To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,<br/>That crost the trencher as she laid it down:<br/>But after all had eaten, then Geraint,<br/>For now the wine made summer in his veins,<br/>Let his eye rove in following, or rest<br/>On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,<br/>Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;<br/>Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:<br/><br/>'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;<br/>This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.<br/>His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:<br/>For if he be the knight whom late I saw<br/>Ride into that new fortress by your town,<br/>White from the mason's hand, then have I sworn<br/>From his own lips to have it--I am Geraint<br/>Of Devon--for this morning when the Queen<br/>Sent her own maiden to demand the name,<br/>His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,<br/>Struck at her with his whip, and she returned<br/>Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore<br/>That I would track this caitiff to his hold,<br/>And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.<br/>And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find<br/>Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;<br/>They take the rustic murmur of their bourg<br/>For the great wave that echoes round the world;<br/>They would not hear me speak: but if ye know<br/>Where I can light on arms, or if yourself<br/>Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn<br/>That I will break his pride and learn his name,<br/>Avenging this great insult done the Queen.'<br/><br/>Then cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,<br/>Geraint, a name far-sounded among men<br/>For noble deeds? and truly I, when first<br/>I saw you moving by me on the bridge,<br/>Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state<br/>And presence might have guessed you one of those<br/>That eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.<br/>Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;<br/>For this dear child hath often heard me praise<br/>Your feats of arms, and often when I paused<br/>Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;<br/>So grateful is the noise of noble deeds<br/>To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:<br/>O never yet had woman such a pair<br/>Of suitors as this maiden: first Limours,<br/>A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,<br/>Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead<br/>I know not, but he past to the wild land.<br/>The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,<br/>My curse, my nephew--I will not let his name<br/>Slip from my lips if I can help it--he,<br/>When that I knew him fierce and turbulent<br/>Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;<br/>And since the proud man often is the mean,<br/>He sowed a slander in the common ear,<br/>Affirming that his father left him gold,<br/>And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;<br/>Bribed with large promises the men who served<br/>About my person, the more easily<br/>Because my means were somewhat broken into<br/>Through open doors and hospitality;<br/>Raised my own town against me in the night<br/>Before my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;<br/>From mine own earldom foully ousted me;<br/>Built that new fort to overawe my friends,<br/>For truly there are those who love me yet;<br/>And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,<br/>Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,<br/>But that his pride too much despises me:<br/>And I myself sometimes despise myself;<br/>For I have let men be, and have their way;<br/>Am much too gentle, have not used my power:<br/>Nor know I whether I be very base<br/>Or very manful, whether very wise<br/>Or very foolish; only this I know,<br/>That whatsoever evil happen to me,<br/>I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,<br/>But can endure it all most patiently.'<br/><br/>'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,<br/>That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight<br/>In next day's tourney I may break his pride.'<br/><br/>And Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old<br/>And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,<br/>Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.<br/>But in this tournament can no man tilt,<br/>Except the lady he loves best be there.<br/>Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,<br/>And over these is placed a silver wand,<br/>And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,<br/>The prize of beauty for the fairest there.<br/>And this, what knight soever be in field<br/>Lays claim to for the lady at his side,<br/>And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,<br/>Who being apt at arms and big of bone<br/>Has ever won it for the lady with him,<br/>And toppling over all antagonism<br/>Has earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'<br/>But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'<br/><br/>To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,<br/>Leaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!<br/>Let ME lay lance in rest, O noble host,<br/>For this dear child, because I never saw,<br/>Though having seen all beauties of our time,<br/>Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.<br/>And if I fall her name will yet remain<br/>Untarnished as before; but if I live,<br/>So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,<br/>As I will make her truly my true wife.'<br/><br/>Then, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart<br/>Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,<br/>And looking round he saw not Enid there,<br/>(Who hearing her own name had stolen away)<br/>But that old dame, to whom full tenderly<br/>And folding all her hand in his he said,<br/>'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,<br/>And best by her that bore her understood.<br/>Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest<br/>Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'<br/><br/>So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she<br/>With frequent smile and nod departing found,<br/>Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;<br/>Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then<br/>On either shining shoulder laid a hand,<br/>And kept her off and gazed upon her face,<br/>And told them all their converse in the hall,<br/>Proving her heart: but never light and shade<br/>Coursed one another more on open ground<br/>Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale<br/>Across the face of Enid hearing her;<br/>While slowly falling as a scale that falls,<br/>When weight is added only grain by grain,<br/>Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;<br/>Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,<br/>Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;<br/>So moving without answer to her rest<br/>She found no rest, and ever failed to draw<br/>The quiet night into her blood, but lay<br/>Contemplating her own unworthiness;<br/>And when the pale and bloodless east began<br/>To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised<br/>Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved<br/>Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,<br/>And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.<br/><br/>And thither came the twain, and when Geraint<br/>Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,<br/>He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,<br/>Himself beyond the rest pushing could move<br/>The chair of Idris. Yniol's rusted arms<br/>Were on his princely person, but through these<br/>Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights<br/>And ladies came, and by and by the town<br/>Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.<br/>And there they fixt the forks into the ground,<br/>And over these they placed the silver wand,<br/>And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.<br/>Then Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,<br/>Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,<br/>'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,<br/>What I these two years past have won for thee,<br/>The prize of beauty.' Loudly spake the Prince,<br/>'Forbear: there is a worthier,' and the knight<br/>With some surprise and thrice as much disdain<br/>Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face<br/>Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,<br/>So burnt he was with passion, crying out,<br/>'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice<br/>They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.<br/>Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each<br/>So often and with such blows, that all the crowd<br/>Wondered, and now and then from distant walls<br/>There came a clapping as of phantom hands.<br/>So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still<br/>The dew of their great labour, and the blood<br/>Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.<br/>But either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,<br/>'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'<br/>Increased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,<br/>And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,<br/>And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,<br/>And said, 'Thy name?' To whom the fallen man<br/>Made answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!<br/>Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.<br/>My pride is broken: men have seen my fall.'<br/>'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,<br/>'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.<br/>First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,<br/>Shalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,<br/>Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,<br/>And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,<br/>Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.<br/>These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'<br/>And Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,<br/>For I have never yet been overthrown,<br/>And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride<br/>Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'<br/>And rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,<br/>And there the Queen forgave him easily.<br/>And being young, he changed and came to loathe<br/>His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself<br/>Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last<br/>In the great battle fighting for the King.<br/><br/>But when the third day from the hunting-morn<br/>Made a low splendour in the world, and wings<br/>Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay<br/>With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,<br/>Among the dancing shadows of the birds,<br/>Woke and bethought her of her promise given<br/>No later than last eve to Prince Geraint--<br/>So bent he seemed on going the third day,<br/>He would not leave her, till her promise given--<br/>To ride with him this morning to the court,<br/>And there be made known to the stately Queen,<br/>And there be wedded with all ceremony.<br/>At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,<br/>And thought it never yet had looked so mean.<br/>For as a leaf in mid-November is<br/>To what it is in mid-October, seemed<br/>The dress that now she looked on to the dress<br/>She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.<br/>And still she looked, and still the terror grew<br/>Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,<br/>All staring at her in her faded silk:<br/>And softly to her own sweet heart she said:<br/><br/>'This noble prince who won our earldom back,<br/>So splendid in his acts and his attire,<br/>Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!<br/>Would he could tarry with us here awhile,<br/>But being so beholden to the Prince,<br/>It were but little grace in any of us,<br/>Bent as he seemed on going this third day,<br/>To seek a second favour at his hands.<br/>Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,<br/>Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,<br/>Far liefer than so much discredit him.'<br/><br/>And Enid fell in longing for a dress<br/>All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift<br/>Of her good mother, given her on the night<br/>Before her birthday, three sad years ago,<br/>That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,<br/>And scattered all they had to all the winds:<br/>For while the mother showed it, and the two<br/>Were turning and admiring it, the work<br/>To both appeared so costly, rose a cry<br/>That Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled<br/>With little save the jewels they had on,<br/>Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:<br/>And Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,<br/>And placed them in this ruin; and she wished<br/>The Prince had found her in her ancient home;<br/>Then let her fancy flit across the past,<br/>And roam the goodly places that she knew;<br/>And last bethought her how she used to watch,<br/>Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;<br/>And one was patched and blurred and lustreless<br/>Among his burnished brethren of the pool;<br/>And half asleep she made comparison<br/>Of that and these to her own faded self<br/>And the gay court, and fell asleep again;<br/>And dreamt herself was such a faded form<br/>Among her burnished sisters of the pool;<br/>But this was in the garden of a king;<br/>And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew<br/>That all was bright; that all about were birds<br/>Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;<br/>That all the turf was rich in plots that looked<br/>Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;<br/>And lords and ladies of the high court went<br/>In silver tissue talking things of state;<br/>And children of the King in cloth of gold<br/>Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;<br/>And while she thought 'They will not see me,' came<br/>A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,<br/>And all the children in their cloth of gold<br/>Ran to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all<br/>Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now<br/>To pick the faded creature from the pool,<br/>And cast it on the mixen that it die.'<br/>And therewithal one came and seized on her,<br/>And Enid started waking, with her heart<br/>All overshadowed by the foolish dream,<br/>And lo! it was her mother grasping her<br/>To get her well awake; and in her hand<br/>A suit of bright apparel, which she laid<br/>Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:<br/><br/>'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,<br/>How fast they hold like colours of a shell<br/>That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.<br/>Why not? It never yet was worn, I trow:<br/>Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'<br/><br/>And Enid looked, but all confused at first,<br/>Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:<br/>Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,<br/>And answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,<br/>So sadly lost on that unhappy night;<br/>Your own good gift!' 'Yea, surely,' said the dame,<br/>'And gladly given again this happy morn.<br/>For when the jousts were ended yesterday,<br/>Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere<br/>He found the sack and plunder of our house<br/>All scattered through the houses of the town;<br/>And gave command that all which once was ours<br/>Should now be ours again: and yester-eve,<br/>While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,<br/>Came one with this and laid it in my hand,<br/>For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,<br/>Because we have our earldom back again.<br/>And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,<br/>But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.<br/>Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?<br/>For I myself unwillingly have worn<br/>My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,<br/>And howsoever patient, Yniol his.<br/>Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,<br/>With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,<br/>And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,<br/>And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all<br/>That appertains to noble maintenance.<br/>Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;<br/>But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,<br/>And all through that young traitor, cruel need<br/>Constrained us, but a better time has come;<br/>So clothe yourself in this, that better fits<br/>Our mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:<br/>For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,<br/>And though I heard him call you fairest fair,<br/>Let never maiden think, however fair,<br/>She is not fairer in new clothes than old.<br/>And should some great court-lady say, the Prince<br/>Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,<br/>And like a madman brought her to the court,<br/>Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince<br/>To whom we are beholden; but I know,<br/>That when my dear child is set forth at her best,<br/>That neither court nor country, though they sought<br/>Through all the provinces like those of old<br/>That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'<br/><br/>Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;<br/>And Enid listened brightening as she lay;<br/>Then, as the white and glittering star of morn<br/>Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by<br/>Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,<br/>And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,<br/>Helped by the mother's careful hand and eye,<br/>Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;<br/>Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,<br/>She never yet had seen her half so fair;<br/>And called her like that maiden in the tale,<br/>Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers<br/>And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,<br/>Flur, for whose love the Roman Csar first<br/>Invaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,<br/>As this great Prince invaded us, and we,<br/>Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy<br/>And I can scarcely ride with you to court,<br/>For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;<br/>But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream<br/>I see my princess as I see her now,<br/>Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'<br/><br/>But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint<br/>Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called<br/>For Enid, and when Yniol made report<br/>Of that good mother making Enid gay<br/>In such apparel as might well beseem<br/>His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,<br/>He answered: 'Earl, entreat her by my love,<br/>Albeit I give no reason but my wish,<br/>That she ride with me in her faded silk.'<br/>Yniol with that hard message went; it fell<br/>Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:<br/>For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,<br/>Dared not to glance at her good mother's face,<br/>But silently, in all obedience,<br/>Her mother silent too, nor helping her,<br/>Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,<br/>And robed them in her ancient suit again,<br/>And so descended. Never man rejoiced<br/>More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;<br/>And glancing all at once as keenly at her<br/>As careful robins eye the delver's toil,<br/>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,<br/>But rested with her sweet face satisfied;<br/>Then seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,<br/>Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,<br/><br/>'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved<br/>At thy new son, for my petition to her.<br/>When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,<br/>In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,<br/>Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,<br/>Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.<br/>Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,<br/>Beholding one so bright in dark estate,<br/>I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,<br/>No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst<br/>Sunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,<br/>That service done so graciously would bind<br/>The two together; fain I would the two<br/>Should love each other: how can Enid find<br/>A nobler friend? Another thought was mine;<br/>I came among you here so suddenly,<br/>That though her gentle presence at the lists<br/>Might well have served for proof that I was loved,<br/>I doubted whether daughter's tenderness,<br/>Or easy nature, might not let itself<br/>Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;<br/>Or whether some false sense in her own self<br/>Of my contrasting brightness, overbore<br/>Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;<br/>And such a sense might make her long for court<br/>And all its perilous glories: and I thought,<br/>That could I someway prove such force in her<br/>Linked with such love for me, that at a word<br/>(No reason given her) she could cast aside<br/>A splendour dear to women, new to her,<br/>And therefore dearer; or if not so new,<br/>Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power<br/>Of intermitted usage; then I felt<br/>That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,<br/>Fixt on her faith. Now, therefore, I do rest,<br/>A prophet certain of my prophecy,<br/>That never shadow of mistrust can cross<br/>Between us. Grant me pardon for my thoughts:<br/>And for my strange petition I will make<br/>Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,<br/>When your fair child shall wear your costly gift<br/>Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,<br/>Who knows? another gift of the high God,<br/>Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'<br/><br/>He spoke: the mother smiled, but half in tears,<br/>Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,<br/>And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.<br/><br/>Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed<br/>The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,<br/>Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,<br/>And white sails flying on the yellow sea;<br/>But not to goodly hill or yellow sea<br/>Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,<br/>By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;<br/>And then descending met them at the gates,<br/>Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,<br/>And did her honour as the Prince's bride,<br/>And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;<br/>And all that week was old Caerleon gay,<br/>For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,<br/>They twain were wedded with all ceremony.<br/><br/>And this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.<br/>But Enid ever kept the faded silk,<br/>Remembering how first he came on her,<br/>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,<br/>And all her foolish fears about the dress,<br/>And all his journey toward her, as himself<br/>Had told her, and their coming to the court.<br/><br/>And now this morning when he said to her,<br/>'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found<br/>And took it, and arrayed herself therein.
