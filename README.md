# üíÆ The Last Tournament by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood<br/>Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,<br/>At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,<br/>Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.<br/>And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,<br/>And from the crown thereof a carcanet<br/>Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize<br/>Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,<br/>Came Tristram, saying, `Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'<br/><br/>For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once<br/>Far down beneath a winding wall of rock<br/>Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead,<br/>From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,<br/>Clutched at the crag, and started through mid air<br/>Bearing an eagle's nest: and through the tree<br/>Rushed ever a rainy wind, and through the wind<br/>Pierced ever a child's cry: and crag and tree<br/>Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,<br/>This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,<br/>And all unscarred from beak or talon, brought<br/>A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,<br/>Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the Queen<br/>But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms<br/>Received, and after loved it tenderly,<br/>And named it Nestling; so forgot herself<br/>A moment, and her cares; till that young life<br/>Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold<br/>Past from her; and in time the carcanet<br/>Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:<br/>So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,<br/>`Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,<br/>And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize.'<br/><br/>To whom the King, `Peace to thine eagle-borne<br/>Dead nestling, and this honour after death,<br/>Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse<br/>Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone<br/>Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,<br/>And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear.'<br/><br/>`Would rather you had let them fall,' she cried,<br/>`Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,<br/>A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,<br/>Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--<br/>Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out<br/>Above the river--that unhappy child<br/>Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go<br/>With these rich jewels, seeing that they came<br/>Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,<br/>But the sweet body of a maiden babe.<br/>Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights<br/>May win them for the purest of my maids.'<br/><br/>She ended, and the cry of a great jousts<br/>With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways<br/>From Camelot in among the faded fields<br/>To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights<br/>Armed for a day of glory before the King.<br/><br/>But on the hither side of that loud morn<br/>Into the hall staggered, his visage ribbed<br/>From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose<br/>Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,<br/>And one with shattered fingers dangling lame,<br/>A churl, to whom indignantly the King,<br/><br/>`My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast<br/>Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?<br/>Man was it who marred heaven's image in thee thus?'<br/><br/>Then, sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth,<br/>Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump<br/>Pitch-blackened sawing the air, said the maimed churl,<br/><br/>`He took them and he drave them to his tower--<br/>Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--<br/>A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--<br/>Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight<br/>Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;<br/>And when I called upon thy name as one<br/>That doest right by gentle and by churl,<br/>Maimed me and mauled, and would outright have slain,<br/>Save that he sware me to a message, saying,<br/>"Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I<br/>Have founded my Round Table in the North,<br/>And whatsoever his own knights have sworn<br/>My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say<br/>My tower is full of harlots, like his court,<br/>But mine are worthier, seeing they profess<br/>To be none other than themselves--and say<br/>My knights are all adulterers like his own,<br/>But mine are truer, seeing they profess<br/>To be none other; and say his hour is come,<br/>The heathen are upon him, his long lance<br/>Broken, and his Excalibur a straw."'<br/><br/>Then Arthur turned to Kay the seneschal,<br/>`Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously<br/>Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.<br/>The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,<br/>Hurled back again so often in empty foam,<br/>Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,<br/>Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom<br/>The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,<br/>Friends, through your manhood and your fealty,--now<br/>Make their last head like Satan in the North.<br/>My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower<br/>Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,<br/>Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,<br/>The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.<br/>But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place<br/>Enchaired tomorrow, arbitrate the field;<br/>For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,<br/>Only to yield my Queen her own again?<br/>Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?'<br/><br/>Thereto Sir Lancelot answered, `It is well:<br/>Yet better if the King abide, and leave<br/>The leading of his younger knights to me.<br/>Else, for the King has willed it, it is well.'<br/><br/>Then Arthur rose and Lancelot followed him,<br/>And while they stood without the doors, the King<br/>Turned to him saying, `Is it then so well?<br/>Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he<br/>Of whom was written, "A sound is in his ears"?<br/>The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance<br/>That only seems half-loyal to command,--<br/>A manner somewhat fallen from reverence--<br/>Or have I dreamed the bearing of our knights<br/>Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?<br/>Or whence the fear lest this my realm, upreared,<br/>By noble deeds at one with noble vows,<br/>From flat confusion and brute violences,<br/>Reel back into the beast, and be no more?'<br/><br/>He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,<br/>Down the slope city rode, and sharply turned<br/>North by the gate. In her high bower the Queen,<br/>Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,<br/>Watched her lord pass, and knew not that she sighed.<br/>Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme<br/>Of bygone Merlin, `Where is he who knows?<br/>From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'<br/><br/>But when the morning of a tournament,<br/>By these in earnest those in mockery called<br/>The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,<br/>Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,<br/>Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,<br/>The words of Arthur flying shrieked, arose,<br/>And down a streetway hung with folds of pure<br/>White samite, and by fountains running wine,<br/>Where children sat in white with cups of gold,<br/>Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps<br/>Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.<br/><br/>He glanced and saw the stately galleries,<br/>Dame, damsel, each through worship of their Queen<br/>White-robed in honour of the stainless child,<br/>And some with scattered jewels, like a bank<br/>Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.<br/>He looked but once, and vailed his eyes again.<br/><br/>The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream<br/>To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll<br/>Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:<br/>And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf<br/>And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume<br/>Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one<br/>Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,<br/>When all the goodlier guests are past away,<br/>Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.<br/>He saw the laws that ruled the tournament<br/>Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down<br/>Before his throne of arbitration cursed<br/>The dead babe and the follies of the King;<br/>And once the laces of a helmet cracked,<br/>And showed him, like a vermin in its hole,<br/>Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard<br/>The voice that billowed round the barriers roar<br/>An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,<br/>But newly-entered, taller than the rest,<br/>And armoured all in forest green, whereon<br/>There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,<br/>And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,<br/>With ever-scattering berries, and on shield<br/>A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late<br/>From overseas in Brittany returned,<br/>And marriage with a princess of that realm,<br/>Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--<br/>Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain<br/>His own against him, and now yearned to shake<br/>The burthen off his heart in one full shock<br/>With Tristram even to death: his strong hands gript<br/>And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,<br/>Until he groaned for wrath--so many of those,<br/>That ware their ladies' colours on the casque,<br/>Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,<br/>And there with gibes and flickering mockeries<br/>Stood, while he muttered, `Craven crests! O shame!<br/>What faith have these in whom they sware to love?<br/>The glory of our Round Table is no more.'<br/><br/>So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,<br/>Not speaking other word than `Hast thou won?<br/>Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand<br/>Wherewith thou takest this, is red!' to whom<br/>Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,<br/>Made answer, `Ay, but wherefore toss me this<br/>Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?<br/>Lest be thy fair Queen's fantasy. Strength of heart<br/>And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,<br/>Are winners in this pastime of our King.<br/>My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--<br/>No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,<br/>Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,<br/>Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;<br/>Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.'<br/><br/>And Tristram round the gallery made his horse<br/>Caracole; then bowed his homage, bluntly saying,<br/>`Fair damsels, each to him who worships each<br/>Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold<br/>This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.'<br/>And most of these were mute, some angered, one<br/>Murmuring, `All courtesy is dead,' and one,<br/>`The glory of our Round Table is no more.'<br/><br/>Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,<br/>And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day<br/>Went glooming down in wet and weariness:<br/>But under her black brows a swarthy one<br/>Laughed shrilly, crying, `Praise the patient saints,<br/>Our one white day of Innocence hath past,<br/>Though somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it.<br/>The snowdrop only, flowering through the year,<br/>Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.<br/>Come--let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen's<br/>And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity<br/>With all the kindlier colours of the field.'<br/><br/>So dame and damsel glittered at the feast<br/>Variously gay: for he that tells the tale<br/>Likened them, saying, as when an hour of cold<br/>Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,<br/>And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers<br/>Pass under white, till the warm hour returns<br/>With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;<br/>So dame and damsel cast the simple white,<br/>And glowing in all colours, the live grass,<br/>Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced<br/>About the revels, and with mirth so loud<br/>Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,<br/>And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,<br/>Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower<br/>Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.<br/><br/>And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,<br/>High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,<br/>Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.<br/>Then Tristram saying, `Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'<br/>Wheeled round on either heel, Dagonet replied,<br/>`Belike for lack of wiser company;<br/>Or being fool, and seeing too much wit<br/>Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip<br/>To know myself the wisest knight of all.'<br/>`Ay, fool,' said Tristram, `but 'tis eating dry<br/>To dance without a catch, a roundelay<br/>To dance to.' Then he twangled on his harp,<br/>And while he twangled little Dagonet stood<br/>Quiet as any water-sodden log<br/>Stayed in the wandering warble of a brook;<br/>But when the twangling ended, skipt again;<br/>And being asked, `Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?'<br/>Made answer, `I had liefer twenty years<br/>Skip to the broken music of my brains<br/>Than any broken music thou canst make.'<br/>Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,<br/>`Good now, what music have I broken, fool?'<br/>And little Dagonet, skipping, `Arthur, the King's;<br/>For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,<br/>Thou makest broken music with thy bride,<br/>Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--<br/>And so thou breakest Arthur's music too.'<br/>`Save for that broken music in thy brains,<br/>Sir Fool,' said Tristram, `I would break thy head.<br/>Fool, I came too late, the heathen wars were o'er,<br/>The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--<br/>I am but a fool to reason with a fool--<br/>Come, thou art crabbed and sour: but lean me down,<br/>Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,<br/>And harken if my music be not true.<br/><br/>`"Free love--free field--we love but while we may:<br/>The woods are hushed, their music is no more:<br/>The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:<br/>New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:<br/>New life, new love, to suit the newer day:<br/>New loves are sweet as those that went before:<br/>Free love--free field--we love but while we may."<br/><br/>`Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,<br/>Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods,<br/>And heard it ring as true as tested gold.'<br/><br/>But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,<br/>`Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday<br/>Made to run wine?--but this had run itself<br/>All out like a long life to a sour end--<br/>And them that round it sat with golden cups<br/>To hand the wine to whosoever came--<br/>The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,<br/>In honour of poor Innocence the babe,<br/>Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen<br/>Lent to the King, and Innocence the King<br/>Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips<br/>Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,<br/>"Drink, drink, Sir Fool," and thereupon I drank,<br/>Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud.'<br/><br/>And Tristram, `Was it muddier than thy gibes?<br/>Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--<br/>Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--<br/>"Fear God: honour the King--his one true knight--<br/>Sole follower of the vows"--for here be they<br/>Who knew thee swine enow before I came,<br/>Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King<br/>Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up<br/>It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;<br/>Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,<br/>A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,<br/>For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine.'<br/><br/>And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,<br/>`Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck<br/>In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch<br/>Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.<br/>Swine? I have wallowed, I have washed--the world<br/>Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.<br/>The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind<br/>Hath fouled me--an I wallowed, then I washed--<br/>I have had my day and my philosophies--<br/>And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool.<br/>Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese<br/>Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed<br/>On such a wire as musically as thou<br/>Some such fine song--but never a king's fool.'<br/><br/>And Tristram, `Then were swine, goats, asses, geese<br/>The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard<br/>Had such a mastery of his mystery<br/>That he could harp his wife up out of hell.'<br/><br/>Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,<br/>`And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself<br/>Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou,<br/>That harpest downward! Dost thou know the star<br/>We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?'<br/><br/>And Tristram, `Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King<br/>Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,<br/>Glorying in each new glory, set his name<br/>High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven.'<br/><br/>And Dagonet answered, `Ay, and when the land<br/>Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself<br/>To babble about him, all to show your wit--<br/>And whether he were King by courtesy,<br/>Or King by right--and so went harping down<br/>The black king's highway, got so far, and grew<br/>So witty that ye played at ducks and drakes<br/>With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.<br/>Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?'<br/><br/>`Nay, fool,' said Tristram, `not in open day.'<br/>And Dagonet, `Nay, nor will: I see it and hear.<br/>It makes a silent music up in heaven,<br/>And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,<br/>And then we skip.' `Lo, fool,' he said, `ye talk<br/>Fool's treason: is the King thy brother fool?'<br/>Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled,<br/>`Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!<br/>Conceits himself as God that he can make<br/>Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk<br/>From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,<br/>And men from beasts--Long live the king of fools!'<br/><br/>And down the city Dagonet danced away;<br/>But through the slowly-mellowing avenues<br/>And solitary passes of the wood<br/>Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.<br/>Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt<br/>With ruby-circled neck, but evermore<br/>Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood<br/>Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye<br/>For all that walked, or crept, or perched, or flew.<br/>Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,<br/>Unruffling waters re-collect the shape<br/>Of one that in them sees himself, returned;<br/>But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,<br/>Or even a fallen feather, vanished again.<br/><br/>So on for all that day from lawn to lawn<br/>Through many a league-long bower he rode. At length<br/>A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs<br/>Furze-crammed, and bracken-rooft, the which himself<br/>Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt<br/>Against a shower, dark in the golden grove<br/>Appearing, sent his fancy back to where<br/>She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:<br/>Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,<br/>With six or seven, when Tristram was away,<br/>And snatched her thence; yet dreading worse than shame<br/>Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,<br/>But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.<br/><br/>And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt<br/>So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank<br/>Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;<br/>But could not rest for musing how to smoothe<br/>And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.<br/>Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all<br/>The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.<br/>But then what folly had sent him overseas<br/>After she left him lonely here? a name?<br/>Was it the name of one in Brittany,<br/>Isolt, the daughter of the King? `Isolt<br/>Of the white hands' they called her: the sweet name<br/>Allured him first, and then the maid herself,<br/>Who served him well with those white hands of hers,<br/>And loved him well, until himself had thought<br/>He loved her also, wedded easily,<br/>But left her all as easily, and returned.<br/>The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes<br/>Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid<br/>His brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed.<br/><br/>He seemed to pace the strand of Brittany<br/>Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,<br/>And showed them both the ruby-chain, and both<br/>Began to struggle for it, till his Queen<br/>Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.<br/>Then cried the Breton, `Look, her hand is red!<br/>These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,<br/>And melts within her hand--her hand is hot<br/>With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,<br/>Is all as cool and white as any flower.'<br/>Followed a rush of eagle's wings, and then<br/>A whimpering of the spirit of the child,<br/>Because the twain had spoiled her carcanet.<br/><br/>He dreamed; but Arthur with a hundred spears<br/>Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,<br/>And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,<br/>The wide-winged sunset of the misty marsh<br/>Glared on a huge machicolated tower<br/>That stood with open doors, whereout was rolled<br/>A roar of riot, as from men secure<br/>Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease<br/>Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.<br/>`Lo there,' said one of Arthur's youth, for there,<br/>High on a grim dead tree before the tower,<br/>A goodly brother of the Table Round<br/>Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield<br/>Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,<br/>And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights<br/>At that dishonour done the gilded spur,<br/>Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.<br/>But Arthur waved them back. Alone he rode.<br/>Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,<br/>That sent the face of all the marsh aloft<br/>An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud<br/>Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,<br/>Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,<br/>In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King,<br/><br/>`The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!--<br/>Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King<br/>Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--<br/>The woman-worshipper? Yea, God's curse, and I!<br/>Slain was the brother of my paramour<br/>By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine<br/>And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,<br/>Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,<br/>And stings itself to everlasting death,<br/>To hang whatever knight of thine I fought<br/>And tumbled. Art thou King? --Look to thy life!'<br/><br/>He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face<br/>Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name<br/>Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.<br/>And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,<br/>But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse<br/>To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,<br/>Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp<br/>Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,<br/>Heard in dead night along that table-shore,<br/>Drops flat, and after the great waters break<br/>Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,<br/>Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,<br/>From less and less to nothing; thus he fell<br/>Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared<br/>And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;<br/>There trampled out his face from being known,<br/>And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:<br/>Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang<br/>Through open doors, and swording right and left<br/>Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled<br/>The tables over and the wines, and slew<br/>Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,<br/>And all the pavement streamed with massacre:<br/>Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,<br/>Which half that autumn night, like the live North,<br/>Red-pulsing up through Alioth and Alcor,<br/>Made all above it, and a hundred meres<br/>About it, as the water Moab saw<br/>Came round by the East, and out beyond them flushed<br/>The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.<br/><br/>So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,<br/>But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.<br/><br/>Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream<br/>Fled with a shout, and that low lodge returned,<br/>Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.<br/>He whistled his good warhorse left to graze<br/>Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,<br/>And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,<br/>Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,<br/>Stayed him. `Why weep ye?' `Lord,' she said, `my man<br/>Hath left me or is dead;' whereon he thought--<br/>`What, if she hate me now? I would not this.<br/>What, if she love me still? I would not that.<br/>I know not what I would'--but said to her,<br/>`Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,<br/>He find thy favour changed and love thee not'--<br/>Then pressing day by day through Lyonnesse<br/>Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard<br/>The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds<br/>Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gained<br/>Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,<br/>A crown of towers.<br/><br/>Down in a casement sat,<br/>A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair<br/>And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.<br/>And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind<br/>The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,<br/>Flushed, started, met him at the doors, and there<br/>Belted his body with her white embrace,<br/>Crying aloud, `Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!<br/>The footstep fluttered me at first: not he:<br/>Catlike through his own castle steals my Mark,<br/>But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls<br/>Who hates thee, as I him--even to the death.<br/>My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark<br/>Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh.'<br/>To whom Sir Tristram smiling, `I am here.<br/>Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.'<br/><br/>And drawing somewhat backward she replied,<br/>`Can he be wronged who is not even his own,<br/>But save for dread of thee had beaten me,<br/>Scratched, bitten, blinded, marred me somehow--Mark?<br/>What rights are his that dare not strike for them?<br/>Not lift a hand--not, though he found me thus!<br/>But harken! have ye met him? hence he went<br/>Today for three days' hunting--as he said--<br/>And so returns belike within an hour.<br/>Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with Mark,<br/>Because he hates thee even more than fears;<br/>Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood<br/>Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush<br/>Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.<br/>My God, the measure of my hate for Mark<br/>Is as the measure of my love for thee.'<br/><br/>So, plucked one way by hate and one by love,<br/>Drained of her force, again she sat, and spake<br/>To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,<br/>`O hunter, and O blower of the horn,<br/>Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,<br/>For, ere I mated with my shambling king,<br/>Ye twain had fallen out about the bride<br/>Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,<br/>If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)--<br/>Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks<br/>To wreck thee villainously: but, O Sir Knight,<br/>What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?'<br/><br/>And Tristram, `Last to my Queen Paramount,<br/>Here now to my Queen Paramount of love<br/>And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when first<br/>Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,<br/>Sailing from Ireland.'<br/><br/>Softly laughed Isolt;<br/>`Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen<br/>My dole of beauty trebled?' and he said,<br/>`Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,<br/>And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--<br/>Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips<br/>Most gracious; but she, haughty, even to him,<br/>Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow<br/>To make one doubt if ever the great Queen<br/>Have yielded him her love.'<br/><br/>To whom Isolt,<br/>`Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou<br/>Who brakest through the scruple of my bond,<br/>Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me<br/>That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,<br/>And I--misyoked with such a want of man--<br/>That I could hardly sin against the lowest.'<br/><br/>He answered, `O my soul, be comforted!<br/>If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,<br/>If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,<br/>Crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin<br/>That made us happy: but how ye greet me--fear<br/>And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--<br/>Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories<br/>Of Tristram in that year he was away.'<br/><br/>And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,<br/>`I had forgotten all in my strong joy<br/>To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,<br/>Here in the never-ended afternoon,<br/>O sweeter than all memories of thee,<br/>Deeper than any yearnings after thee<br/>Seemed those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,<br/>Watched from this tower. Isolt of Britain dashed<br/>Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,<br/>Would that have chilled her bride-kiss? Wedded her?<br/>Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?<br/>The King was all fulfilled with gratefulness,<br/>And she, my namesake of the hands, that healed<br/>Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--<br/>Well--can I wish her any huger wrong<br/>Than having known thee? her too hast thou left<br/>To pine and waste in those sweet memories.<br/>O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men<br/>Are noble, I should hate thee more than love.'<br/><br/>And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,<br/>`Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me well.<br/>Did I love her? the name at least I loved.<br/>Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!<br/>The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt!<br/>The name was ruler of the dark--Isolt?<br/>Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,<br/>Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God.'<br/><br/>And Isolt answered, `Yea, and why not I?<br/>Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,<br/>Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now.<br/>Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,<br/>Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,<br/>Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,<br/>And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.<br/>Then flashed a levin-brand; and near me stood,<br/>In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--<br/>Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--<br/>For there was Mark: "He has wedded her," he said,<br/>Not said, but hissed it: then this crown of towers<br/>So shook to such a roar of all the sky,<br/>That here in utter dark I swooned away,<br/>And woke again in utter dark, and cried,<br/>"I will flee hence and give myself to God"--<br/>And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms.'<br/><br/>Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,<br/>`May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,<br/>And past desire!' a saying that angered her.<br/>`"May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,<br/>And sweet no more to me!" I need Him now.<br/>For when had Lancelot uttered aught so gross<br/>Even to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?<br/>The greater man, the greater courtesy.<br/>Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight!<br/>But thou, through ever harrying thy wild beasts--<br/>Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance<br/>Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.<br/>How darest thou, if lover, push me even<br/>In fancy from thy side, and set me far<br/>In the gray distance, half a life away,<br/>Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear!<br/>Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,<br/>Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,<br/>Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck<br/>Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe.<br/>Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,<br/>And solemnly as when ye sware to him,<br/>The man of men, our King--My God, the power<br/>Was once in vows when men believed the King!<br/>They lied not then, who sware, and through their vows<br/>The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,<br/>Swear to me thou wilt love me even when old,<br/>Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair.'<br/><br/>Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,<br/>`Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark<br/>More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt,<br/>The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--<br/>My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--<br/>We run more counter to the soul thereof<br/>Than had we never sworn. I swear no more.<br/>I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.<br/>For once--even to the height--I honoured him.<br/>"Man, is he man at all?" methought, when first<br/>I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld<br/>That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--<br/>His hair, a sun that rayed from off a brow<br/>Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,<br/>The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--<br/>Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,<br/>With Merlin's mystic babble about his end<br/>Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool<br/>Shaped as a dragon; he seemed to me no man,<br/>But Micha l trampling Satan; so I sware,<br/>Being amazed: but this went by-- The vows!<br/>O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--<br/>They served their use, their time; for every knight<br/>Believed himself a greater than himself,<br/>And every follower eyed him as a God;<br/>Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,<br/>Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,<br/>And so the realm was made; but then their vows--<br/>First mainly through that sullying of our Queen--<br/>Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence<br/>Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?<br/>Dropt down from heaven? washed up from out the deep?<br/>They failed to trace him through the flesh and blood<br/>Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord<br/>To bind them by inviolable vows,<br/>Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:<br/>For feel this arm of mine--the tide within<br/>Red with free chase and heather-scented air,<br/>Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure<br/>As any maiden child? lock up my tongue<br/>From uttering freely what I freely hear?<br/>Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at it.<br/>And worldling of the world am I, and know<br/>The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour<br/>Woos his own end; we are not angels here<br/>Nor shall be: vows--I am woodman of the woods,<br/>And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale<br/>Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may;<br/>And therefore is my love so large for thee,<br/>Seeing it is not bounded save by love.'<br/><br/>Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,<br/>`Good: an I turned away my love for thee<br/>To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--<br/>For courtesy wins woman all as well<br/>As valour may, but he that closes both<br/>Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,<br/>Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I loved<br/>This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back<br/>Thine own small saw, "We love but while we may,"<br/>Well then, what answer?'<br/><br/>He that while she spake,<br/>Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,<br/>The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch<br/>The warm white apple of her throat, replied,<br/>`Press this a little closer, sweet, until--<br/>Come, I am hungered and half-angered--meat,<br/>Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,<br/>And out beyond into the dream to come.'<br/><br/>So then, when both were brought to full accord,<br/>She rose, and set before him all he willed;<br/>And after these had comforted the blood<br/>With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--<br/>Now talking of their woodland paradise,<br/>The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;<br/>Now mocking at the much ungainliness,<br/>And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--<br/>Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:<br/><br/>`Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!<br/>A star in heaven, a star within the mere!<br/>Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,<br/>And one was far apart, and one was near:<br/>Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!<br/>And one was water and one star was fire,<br/>And one will ever shine and one will pass.<br/>Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere.'<br/><br/>Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram showed<br/>And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried,<br/>`The collar of some Order, which our King<br/>Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,<br/>For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers.'<br/><br/>`Not so, my Queen,' he said, `but the red fruit<br/>Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,<br/>And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,<br/>And hither brought by Tristram for his last<br/>Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee.'<br/><br/>He spoke, he turned, then, flinging round her neck,<br/>Claspt it, and cried, `Thine Order, O my Queen!'<br/>But, while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat,<br/>Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,<br/>Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--<br/>`Mark's way,' said Mark, and clove him through the brain.<br/><br/>That night came Arthur home, and while he climbed,<br/>All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,<br/>The stairway to the hall, and looked and saw<br/>The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his feet<br/>A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it,<br/>`What art thou?' and the voice about his feet<br/>Sent up an answer, sobbing, `I am thy fool,<br/>And I shall never make thee smile again.'
