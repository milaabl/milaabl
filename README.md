# üíÆ The Temple of Fame. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    In that soft season, when descending showers<br/>Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flowers;<br/>When opening buds salute the welcome day,<br/>And earth relenting feels the genial ray;<br/>As balmy sleep had charm'd my cares to rest,<br/>And love itself was banish'd from my breast,<br/>(What time the morn mysterious visions brings,<br/>While purer slumbers spread their golden wings),<br/>A train of phantoms in wild order rose,<br/>And, join'd, this intellectual scene compose.<br/><br/>I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies;<br/>The whole creation open to my eyes:<br/>In air self-balanced hung the globe below,<br/>Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow;<br/>Here naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen,<br/>There towery cities, and the forests green:<br/>Here sailing ships delight the wandering eyes:<br/>There trees, and intermingled temples rise;<br/>Now a clear sun the shining scene displays,<br/>The transient landscape now in clouds decays.<br/><br/>O'er the wide prospect, as I gazed around,<br/>Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound,<br/>Like broken thunders that at distance roar,<br/>Or billows murmuring on the hollow shore:<br/>Then gazing up, a glorious pile beheld,<br/>Whose towering summit ambient clouds conceal'd.<br/>High on a rock of ice the structure lay,<br/>Steep its ascent, and slippery was the way;<br/>The wondrous rock like Parian marble shone,<br/>And seem'd, to distant sight, of solid stone.<br/>Inscriptions here of various names I view'd,<br/>The greater part by hostile time subdued;<br/>Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past,<br/>And poets once had promised they should last.<br/>Some fresh engraved appear'd of wits renown'd;<br/>I look'd again, nor could their trace be found.<br/>Critics I saw, that other names deface,<br/>And fix their own, with labour, in their place:<br/>Their own, like others, soon their place resign'd,<br/>Or disappear'd, and left the first behind.<br/>Nor was the work impair'd by storms alone,<br/>But felt the approaches of too warm a sun;<br/>For Fame, impatient of extremes, decays<br/>Not more by envy than excess of praise.<br/>Yet part no injuries of heaven could feel,<br/>Like crystal faithful to the graving steel:<br/>The rock's high summit, in the temple's shade,<br/>Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade.<br/>Their names inscribed unnumber'd ages past<br/>From time's first birth, with time itself shall last;<br/>These ever new, nor subject to decays,<br/>Spread, and grow brighter with the length of days.<br/><br/>So Zembla's rocks (the beauteous work of frost)<br/>Rise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast;<br/>Pale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away,<br/>And on the impassive ice the lightnings play;<br/>Eternal snows the growing mass supply,<br/>Till the bright mountains prop the incumbent sky:<br/>As Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears,<br/>The gather'd winter of a thousand years.<br/><br/>On this foundation Fame's high temple stands.<br/>Stupendous pile! not rear'd by mortal hands.<br/>Whate'er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld,<br/>Or elder Babylon, its frame excell'd.<br/>Four faces had the dome, and every face<br/>Of various structure, but of equal grace;<br/>Four brazen gates, on columns lifted high,<br/>Salute the different quarters of the sky.<br/>Here fabled chiefs in darker ages born,<br/>Or worthies old, whom arms or arts adorn,<br/>Who cities raised, or tamed a monstrous race,<br/>The walls in venerable order grace;<br/>Heroes in animated marble frown,<br/>And legislators seem to think in stone.<br/><br/>Westward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear'd,<br/>On Doric pillars of white marble rear'd,<br/>Crown'd with an architrave of antique mould,<br/>And sculpture rising on the roughen'd gold.<br/>In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld,<br/>And Perseus dreadful with Minerva's shield:<br/>There great Alcides stooping with his toil,<br/>Rests on his club, and holds th' Hesperian spoil.<br/>Here Orpheus sings; trees, moving to the sound,<br/>Start from their roots, and form a shade around;<br/>Amphion there the loud creating lyre<br/>Strikes, and behold a sudden Thebes aspire!<br/>Cyth√¶ron's echoes answer to his call,<br/>And half the mountain rolls into a wall:<br/>There might you see the lengthening spires ascend,<br/>The domes swell up, the widening arches bend,<br/>The growing towers, like exhalations rise,<br/>And the huge columns heave into the skies.<br/><br/>The eastern front was glorious to behold,<br/>With diamond flaming, and barbaric gold.<br/>There Ninus shone, who spread the Assyrian fame,<br/>And the great founder of the Persian name:<br/>There in long robes the royal Magi stand,<br/>Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand,<br/>The sage Chaldeans robed in white appear'd,<br/>And Brachmans, deep in desert woods revered.<br/>These stopp'd the moon, and call'd the unbodied shades<br/>To midnight banquets in the glimmering glades;<br/>Made visionary fabrics round them rise,<br/>And airy spectres skim before their eyes;<br/>Of talismans and sigils knew the power,<br/>And careful watch'd the planetary hour.<br/>Superior, and alone, Confucius stood,<br/>Who taught that useful science--to be good.<br/><br/>But on the south, a long majestic race<br/>Of Egypt's priests the gilded niches grace,<br/>Who measured earth, described the starry spheres,<br/>And traced the long records of lunar years.<br/>High on his car Sesostris struck my view,<br/>Whom sceptred slaves in golden harness drew:<br/>His hands a bow and pointed javelin hold;<br/>His giant limbs are arm'd in scales of gold.<br/>Between the statues obelisks were placed,<br/>And the learn'd walls with hieroglyphics graced.<br/><br/>Of Gothic structure was the northern side,<br/>O'erwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride.<br/>There huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown'd,<br/>And Runic characters were graved around.<br/>There sat Zamolxis with erected eyes,<br/>And Odin here in mimic trances dies.<br/>There on rude iron columns, smear'd with blood,<br/>The horrid forms of Seythian heroes stood,<br/>Druids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung)<br/>And youths that died to be by poets sung.<br/>These, and a thousand more of doubtful fame,<br/>To whom old fables gave a lasting name,<br/>In ranks adorn'd the temple's outward face;<br/>The wall, in lustre and effect like glass,<br/>Which o'er each object casting various dyes,<br/>Enlarges some, and others multiplies:<br/>Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall,<br/>For thus romantic Fame increases all.<br/><br/>The temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold<br/>Wide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold:<br/>Raised on a thousand pillars, wreathed around<br/>With laurel foliage, and with eagles crown'd:<br/>Of bright, transparent beryl were the walls,<br/>The friezes gold, and gold the capitals:<br/>As heaven with stars, the roof with jewels glows,<br/>And ever-living lamps depend in rows.<br/>Full in the passage of each spacious gate,<br/>The sage historians in white garments wait;<br/>Graved o'er their seats the form of Time was found,<br/>His scythe reversed, and both his pinions bound.<br/>Within stood heroes, who through loud alarms<br/>In bloody fields pursued renown in arms.<br/>High on a throne, with trophies charged, I view'd<br/>The youth that all things but himself subdued;<br/>His feet on sceptres and tiaras trod,<br/>And his horn'd head belied the Libyan god.<br/>There C√¶sar, graced with both Minervas, shone;<br/>C√¶sar, the world's great master, and his own;<br/>Unmoved, superior still in every state,<br/>And scarce detested in his country's fate.<br/>But chief were those, who not for empire fought,<br/>But with their toils their people's safety bought:<br/>High o'er the rest Epaminondas stood;<br/>Timoleon, glorious in his brother's blood;<br/>Bold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state;<br/>Great in his triumphs, in retirement great;<br/>And wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind,<br/>With boundless power unbounded virtue join'd,<br/>His own strict judge, and patron of mankind.<br/><br/>Much-suffering heroes next their honours claim,<br/>Those of less noisy, and less guilty fame,<br/>Fair Virtue's silent train: supreme of these<br/>Here ever shines the godlike Socrates:<br/>He whom ungrateful Athens could expel,<br/>At all times just, but when he sign'd the shell:<br/>Here his abode the martyr'd Phocion claims,<br/>With Agis, not the last of Spartan names:<br/>Unconquer'd Cato shows the wound he tore,<br/>And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more.<br/><br/>But in the centre of the hallow'd choir,<br/>Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire;<br/>Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand,<br/>Hold the chief honours, and the fane command.<br/>High on the first, the mighty Homer shone;<br/>Eternal adamant composed his throne;<br/>Father of verse! in holy fillets dress'd,<br/>His silver beard waved gently o'er his breast;<br/>Though blind, a boldness in his looks appears;<br/>In years he seem'd, but not impair'd by years.<br/>The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen:<br/>Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen;<br/>Here Hector, glorious from Patroclus' fall,<br/>Here dragg'd in triumph round the Trojan wall:<br/>Motion and life did every part inspire,<br/>Bold was the work, and proved the master's fire;<br/>A strong expression most he seem'd to affect,<br/>And here and there disclosed a brave neglect.<br/><br/>A golden column next in rank appear'd,<br/>On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd;<br/>Finish'd the whole, and labour'd every part,<br/>With patient touches of unwearied art:<br/>The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate,<br/>Composed his posture, and his look sedate;<br/>On Homer still he fix'd a reverend eye,<br/>Great without pride, in modest majesty.<br/>In living sculpture on the sides were spread<br/>The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead;<br/>Eliza stretch'd upon the funeral pyre,<br/>√Üneas bending with his aged sire:<br/>Troy flamed in burning gold, and o'er the throne,<br/>ARMS AND THE MAN in golden cyphers shone.<br/><br/>Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,<br/>With heads advanced, and pinions stretch'd for flight:<br/>Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode,<br/>And seem'd to labour with the inspiring god.<br/>Across the harp a careless hand he flings,<br/>And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.<br/>The figured games of Greece the column grace,<br/>Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race.<br/>The youths hang o'er their chariots as they run;<br/>The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone;<br/>The champions in distorted postures threat;<br/>And all appear'd irregularly great.<br/><br/>Here happy Horace tuned the Ausonian lyre<br/>To sweeter sounds, and temper'd Pindar's fire:<br/>Pleased with Alc√¶us' manly rage t' infuse<br/>The softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse.<br/>The polish'd pillar different sculptures grace;<br/>A work outlasting monumental brass.<br/>Here smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear,<br/>The Julian star, and great Augustus here;<br/>The doves that round the infant poet spread<br/>Myrtles and bays, hung hovering o'er his head.<br/><br/>Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light,<br/>Sat, fix'd in thought, the mighty Stagyrite;<br/>His sacred head a radiant zodiac crown'd,<br/>And various animals his side surround;<br/>His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view<br/>Superior worlds, and look all Nature through.<br/><br/>With equal rays immortal Tully shone,<br/>The Roman rostra deck'd the Consul's throne:<br/>Gathering his flowing robe, he seem'd to stand<br/>In act to speak, and graceful stretch'd his hand.<br/>Behind, Rome's Genius waits with civic crowns,<br/>And the great Father of his country owns.<br/><br/>These massy columns in a circle rise,<br/>O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:<br/>Scarce to the top I stretch'd my aching sight,<br/>So large it spread, and swell'd to such a height.<br/>Full in the midst, proud Fame's imperial seat<br/>With jewels blazed, magnificently great;<br/>The vivid emeralds there revive the eye,<br/>The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye,<br/>Bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream,<br/>And lucid amber casts a golden gleam.<br/>With various-colour'd light the pavement shone,<br/>And all on fire appear'd the glowing throne;<br/>The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze,<br/>And forms a rainbow of alternate rays.<br/>When on the goddess first I cast my sight,<br/>Scarce seem'd her stature of a cubit's height;<br/>But swell'd to larger size, the more I gazed,<br/>Till to the roof her towering front she raised.<br/>With her, the temple every moment grew,<br/>And ampler vistas open'd to my view:<br/>Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend,<br/>And arches widen, and long aisles extend.<br/>Such was her form as ancient bards have told,<br/>Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold;<br/>A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears,<br/>A thousand open eyes, and thousand listening ears.<br/>Beneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine<br/>(Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine:<br/>With eyes on Fame for ever fix'd, they sing;<br/>For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string;<br/>With Time's first birth began the heavenly lays,<br/>And last, eternal, through the length of days.<br/><br/>Around these wonders as I cast a look,<br/>The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook,<br/>And all the nations, summon'd at the call,<br/>From different quarters fill the crowded hall:<br/>Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard<br/>In various garbs promiscuous throngs appear'd;<br/>Thick as the bees, that with the spring renew<br/>Their flowery toils, and sip the fragrant dew,<br/>When the wing'd colonies first tempt the sky,<br/>O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly,<br/>Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield,<br/>And a low murmur runs along the field.<br/>Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend,<br/>And all degrees before the goddess bend;<br/>The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage,<br/>And boasting youth, and narrative old age.<br/>Their pleas were different, their request the same:<br/>For good and bad alike are fond of Fame.<br/>Some she disgraced, and some with honours crown'd;<br/>Unlike successes equal merits found.<br/>Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns,<br/>And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains.<br/><br/>First at the shrine the learn√®d world appear,<br/>And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer:<br/>'Long have we sought to instruct and please mankind,<br/>With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind;<br/>But thank'd by few, rewarded yet by none,<br/>We here appeal to thy superior throne;<br/>On wit and learning the just prize bestow,<br/>For fame is all we must expect below.'<br/><br/>The goddess heard, and bade the Muses raise<br/>The golden trumpet of eternal praise:<br/>From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound,<br/>That fills the circuit of the world around;<br/>Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud;<br/>The notes at first were rather sweet than loud:<br/>By just degrees they every moment rise,<br/>Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies.<br/>At every breath were balmy odours shed,<br/>Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;<br/>Less fragrant scents the unfolding rose exhales,<br/>Or spices breathing in Arabian gales.<br/><br/>Next these, the good and just, an awful train,<br/>Thus on their knees address the sacred fane:<br/>'Since living virtue is with envy cursed,<br/>And the best men are treated like the worst,<br/>Do thou, just goddess, call our merits forth,<br/>And give each deed the exact intrinsic worth.'<br/><br/>'Not with bare justice shall your act be crown'd,'<br/>(Said Fame), 'but high above desert renown'd:<br/>Let fuller notes the applauding world amaze,<br/>And the loud clarion labour in your praise.'<br/><br/>This band dismiss'd, behold, another crowd<br/>Preferr'd the same request, and lowly bow'd;<br/>The constant tenor of whose well-spent days<br/>No less deserved a just return of praise.<br/>But straight the direful trump of Slander sounds;<br/>Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds;<br/>Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies,<br/>The dire report through every region flies,<br/>In every ear incessant rumours rung,<br/>And gathering scandals grew on every tongue.<br/>From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke<br/>Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:<br/>The poisonous vapour blots the purple skies,<br/>And withers all before it as it flies.<br/><br/>A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore,<br/>And proud defiance in their looks they bore:<br/>'For thee' (they cried), 'amidst alarms and strife,<br/>We sail'd in tempests down the stream of life;<br/>For thee whole nations fill'd with flames and blood,<br/>And swam to empire through the purple flood.<br/>Those ills we dared, thy inspiration own,<br/>What virtue seem'd, was done for thee alone.'<br/><br/>'Ambitious fools!' (the Queen replied, and frown'd)<br/>'Be all your acts in dark oblivion drown'd;<br/>There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone,<br/>Your statues moulder'd, and your names unknown!'<br/>A sudden cloud straight snatch'd them from my sight,<br/>And each majestic phantom sunk in night.<br/><br/>Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen;<br/>Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien.<br/>'Great idol of mankind! we neither claim<br/>The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame;<br/>But safe in deserts from the applause of men,<br/>Would die unheard of, as we lived unseen;<br/>'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight<br/>Those acts of goodness which themselves requite.<br/>Oh let us still the secret joy partake,<br/>To follow virtue even for virtue's sake.'<br/><br/>'And live there men, who slight immortal Fame?<br/>Who then with incense shall adore our name?<br/>But, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride<br/>To blaze those virtues which the good would hide.<br/>Rise, Muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath;<br/>These must not sleep in darkness and in death.'<br/>She said: in air the trembling music floats,<br/>And on the winds triumphant swell the notes;<br/>So soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,<br/>Even listening angels lean'd from heaven to hear:<br/>To furthest shores the ambrosial spirit flies,<br/>Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies.<br/><br/>Next these a youthful train their vows express'd,<br/>With feathers crown'd, with gay embroidery dress'd:<br/>'Hither' (they cried) 'direct your eyes, and see<br/>The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry;<br/>Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays,<br/>Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days;<br/>Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care<br/>To pay due visits, and address the fair:<br/>In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade,<br/>But still in fancy vanquish'd every maid;<br/>Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell,<br/>Yet, would the world believe us, all were well.<br/>The joy let others have, and we the name,<br/>And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.'<br/><br/>The Queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies,<br/>And at each blast a lady's honour dies.<br/><br/>Pleased with the strange success, vast numbers press'd<br/>Around the shrine, and made the same request:<br/>'What! you,' (she cried) 'unlearn'd in arts to please,<br/>Slaves to yourselves, and even fatigued with ease,<br/>Who lose a length of undeserving days,<br/>Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise?<br/>To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall,<br/>The people's fable and the scorn of all.'<br/>Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound,<br/>Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round,<br/>Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud,<br/>And scornful hisses run through all the crowd.<br/><br/>Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done,<br/>Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;<br/>Or who their glory's dire foundation laid<br/>On sovereigns ruin'd, or on friends betray'd;<br/>Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix,<br/>Of crooked counsels, and dark politics;<br/>Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne,<br/>And beg to make the immortal treasons known.<br/>The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire,<br/>With sparks, that seem'd to set the world on fire.<br/>At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast,<br/>And startled Nature trembled with the blast.<br/><br/>This having heard and seen, some Power unknown<br/>Straight changed the scene, and snatch'd me from the throne.<br/>Before my view appear'd a structure fair,<br/>Its site uncertain, if in earth or air;<br/>With rapid motion turn'd the mansion round;<br/>With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound;<br/>Not less in number were the spacious doors,<br/>Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores;<br/>Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day,<br/>Pervious to winds, and open every way.<br/>As flames by nature to the skies ascend,<br/>As weighty bodies to the centre tend,<br/>As to the sea returning rivers roll,<br/>And the touch'd needle trembles to the pole;<br/>Hither, as to their proper place, arise<br/>All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies,<br/>Or spoke aloud, or whisper'd in the ear;<br/>Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here.<br/>As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes<br/>The sinking stone at first a circle makes;<br/>The trembling surface by the motion stirr'd,<br/>Spreads in a second circle, then a third;<br/>Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance,<br/>Fill all the watery plain, and to the margin dance:<br/>Thus every voice and sound, when first they break,<br/>On neighbouring air a soft impression make;<br/>Another ambient circle then they move;<br/>That, in its turn, impels the next above;<br/>Through undulating air the sounds are sent,<br/>And spread o'er all the fluid element.<br/><br/>There various news I heard of love and strife,<br/>Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life,<br/>Of loss and gain, of famine and of store,<br/>Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore,<br/>Of prodigies, and portents seen in air,<br/>Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair,<br/>Of turns of fortune, changes in the state,<br/>The falls of favourites, projects of the great,<br/>Of old mismanagements, taxations new:<br/>All neither wholly false, nor wholly true.<br/><br/>Above, below, without, within, around,<br/>Confused, unnumber'd multitudes are found,<br/>Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away;<br/>Hosts raised by fear, and phantoms of a day:<br/>Astrologers, that future fates foreshow;<br/>Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few;<br/>And priests, and party-zealots, numerous bands<br/>With home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands;<br/>Each talk'd aloud, or in some secret place,<br/>And wild impatience stared in every face.<br/>The flying rumours gather'd as they roll'd,<br/>Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told;<br/>And all who told it added something new,<br/>And all who heard it made enlargements too,<br/>In every ear it spread, on every tongue it grew.<br/>Thus flying east and west, and north and south,<br/>News travell'd with increase from mouth to mouth.<br/>So from a spark, that kindled first by chance,<br/>With gathering force the quickening flames advance;<br/>Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire,<br/>And towers and temples sink in floods of fire.<br/>When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung,<br/>Full grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue,<br/>Through thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow,<br/>And rush in millions on the world below.<br/>Fame sits aloft, and points them out their course,<br/>Their date determines, and prescribes their force:<br/>Some to remain, and some to perish soon;<br/>Or wane and wax alternate like the moon.<br/>Around, a thousand wing√®d wonders fly,<br/>Born by the trumpet's blast, and scatter'd through the sky.<br/><br/>There, at one passage, oft you might survey<br/>A lie and truth contending for the way;<br/>And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent,<br/>Which first should issue through the narrow vent:<br/>At last agreed, together out they fly,<br/>Inseparable now, the truth and lie;<br/>The strict companions are for ever join'd,<br/>And this or that unmix'd, no mortal e'er shall find.<br/><br/>While thus I stood, intent to see and hear,<br/>One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:<br/>'What could thus high thy rash ambition raise?<br/>Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise?'<br/><br/>''Tis true,' said I, 'not void of hopes I came,<br/>For who so fond as youthful bards of fame?<br/>But few, alas! the casual blessing boast,<br/>So hard to gain, so easy to be lost.<br/>How vain that second life in others' breath,<br/>The estate which wits inherit after death!<br/>Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign,<br/>(Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine!)<br/>The great man's curse, without the gains, endure,<br/>Be envied, wretched, and be flatter'd, poor;<br/>All luckless wits their enemies profess'd,<br/>And all successful, jealous friends at best.<br/>Nor Fame I slight, nor for her favours call;<br/>She comes unlook'd for, if she comes at all.<br/>But if the purchase costs so dear a price,<br/>As soothing folly, or exalting vice;<br/>Oh! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway,<br/>And follow still where fortune leads the way;<br/>Or if no basis bear my rising name,<br/>But the fallen ruins of another's fame;<br/>Then teach me, Heaven! to scorn the guilty bays,<br/>Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise,<br/>Unblemish'd let me live, or die unknown;<br/>Oh, grant an honest fame, or grant me none!'
