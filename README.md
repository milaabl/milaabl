# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 10 by *John Milton*

<p>
    Mean while the heinous and despiteful act<br/>Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how<br/>He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve,<br/>Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit,<br/>Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye<br/>Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart<br/>Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just,<br/>Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind<br/>Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed,<br/>Complete to have discovered and repulsed<br/>Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.<br/>For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,<br/>The high injunction, not to taste that fruit,<br/>Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,<br/>(Incurred what could they less?) the penalty;<br/>And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.<br/>Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste<br/>The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad,<br/>For Man; for of his state by this they knew,<br/>Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen<br/>Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news<br/>From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased<br/>All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare<br/>That time celestial visages, yet, mixed<br/>With pity, violated not their bliss.<br/>About the new-arrived, in multitudes<br/>The ethereal people ran, to hear and know<br/>How all befel:  They towards the throne supreme,<br/>Accountable, made haste, to make appear,<br/>With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance<br/>And easily approved; when the Most High<br/>Eternal Father, from his secret cloud,<br/>Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.<br/>Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned<br/>From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed,<br/>Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth,<br/>Which your sincerest care could not prevent;<br/>Foretold so lately what would come to pass,<br/>When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.<br/>I told ye then he should prevail, and speed<br/>On his bad errand; Man should be seduced,<br/>And flattered out of all, believing lies<br/>Against his Maker; no decree of mine<br/>Concurring to necessitate his fall,<br/>Or touch with lightest moment of impulse<br/>His free will, to her own inclining left<br/>In even scale.  But fallen he is; and now<br/>What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass<br/>On his transgression,--death denounced that day?<br/>Which he presumes already vain and void,<br/>Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,<br/>By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find<br/>Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.<br/>Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.<br/>But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,<br/>Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred<br/>All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.<br/>Easy it may be seen that I intend<br/>Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee<br/>Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed<br/>Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary,<br/>And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.<br/>So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright<br/>Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son<br/>Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full<br/>Resplendent all his Father manifest<br/>Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.<br/>Father Eternal, thine is to decree;<br/>Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will<br/>Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved,<br/>Mayest ever rest well pleased.  I go to judge<br/>On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest,<br/>Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,<br/>When time shall be; for so I undertook<br/>Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain<br/>Of right, that I may mitigate their doom<br/>On me derived; yet I shall temper so<br/>Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most<br/>Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.<br/>Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none<br/>Are to behold the judgement, but the judged,<br/>Those two; the third best absent is condemned,<br/>Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:<br/>Conviction to the serpent none belongs.<br/>Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose<br/>Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers,<br/>Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,<br/>Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence<br/>Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.<br/>Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods<br/>Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.<br/>Now was the sun in western cadence low<br/>From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour,<br/>To fan the earth now waked, and usher in<br/>The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool,<br/>Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both,<br/>To sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard<br/>Now walking in the garden, by soft winds<br/>Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,<br/>And from his presence hid themselves among<br/>The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God,<br/>Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.<br/>Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet<br/>My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,<br/>Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude,<br/>Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought:<br/>Or come I less conspicuous, or what change<br/>Absents thee, or what chance detains?--Come forth!<br/>He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first<br/>To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed;<br/>Love was not in their looks, either to God,<br/>Or to each other; but apparent guilt,<br/>And shame, and perturbation, and despair,<br/>Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.<br/>Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.<br/>I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice<br/>Afraid, being naked, hid myself.  To whom<br/>The gracious Judge without revile replied.<br/>My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,<br/>But still rejoiced; how is it now become<br/>So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked, who<br/>Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree,<br/>Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?<br/>To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.<br/>O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand<br/>Before my Judge; either to undergo<br/>Myself the total crime, or to accuse<br/>My other self, the partner of my life;<br/>Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,<br/>I should conceal, and not expose to blame<br/>By my complaint: but strict necessity<br/>Subdues me, and calamitous constraint;<br/>Lest on my head both sin and punishment,<br/>However insupportable, be all<br/>Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou<br/>Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.--<br/>This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help,<br/>And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,<br/>So fit, so acceptable, so divine,<br/>That from her hand I could suspect no ill,<br/>And what she did, whatever in itself,<br/>Her doing seemed to justify the deed;<br/>She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br/>To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.<br/>Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey<br/>Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,<br/>Superiour, or but equal, that to her<br/>Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place<br/>Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,<br/>And for thee, whose perfection far excelled<br/>Hers in all real dignity?  Adorned<br/>She was indeed, and lovely, to attract<br/>Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts<br/>Were such, as under government well seemed;<br/>Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part<br/>And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.<br/>So having said, he thus to Eve in few.<br/>Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?<br/>To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,<br/>Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge<br/>Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.<br/>The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.<br/>Which when the Lord God heard, without delay<br/>To judgement he proceeded on the accused<br/>Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer<br/>The guilt on him, who made him instrument<br/>Of mischief, and polluted from the end<br/>Of his creation; justly then accursed,<br/>As vitiated in nature:  More to know<br/>Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew)<br/>Nor altered his offence; yet God at last<br/>To Satan first in sin his doom applied,<br/>Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:<br/>And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.<br/>Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed<br/>Above all cattle, each beast of the field;<br/>Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go,<br/>And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.<br/>Between thee and the woman I will put<br/>Enmity, and between thine and her seed;<br/>Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.<br/>So spake this oracle, then verified<br/>When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve,<br/>Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven,<br/>Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave<br/>Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed<br/>In open show; and, with ascension bright,<br/>Captivity led captive through the air,<br/>The realm itself of Satan, long usurped;<br/>Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;<br/>Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise;<br/>And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.<br/>Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply<br/>By thy conception; children thou shalt bring<br/>In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will<br/>Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.<br/>On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.<br/>Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,<br/>And eaten of the tree, concerning which<br/>I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof:<br/>Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow<br/>Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life;<br/>Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth<br/>Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;<br/>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,<br/>Till thou return unto the ground; for thou<br/>Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth,<br/>For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.<br/>So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent;<br/>And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,<br/>Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood<br/>Before him naked to the air, that now<br/>Must suffer change, disdained not to begin<br/>Thenceforth the form of servant to assume;<br/>As when he washed his servants feet; so now,<br/>As father of his family, he clad<br/>Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,<br/>Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid;<br/>And thought not much to clothe his enemies;<br/>Nor he their outward only with the skins<br/>Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.<br/>Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness,<br/>Arraying, covered from his Father's sight.<br/>To him with swift ascent he up returned,<br/>Into his blissful bosom reassumed<br/>In glory, as of old; to him appeased<br/>All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man<br/>Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.<br/>Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,<br/>Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,<br/>In counterview within the gates, that now<br/>Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame<br/>Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,<br/>Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.<br/>O Son, why sit we here each other viewing<br/>Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives<br/>In other worlds, and happier seat provides<br/>For us, his offspring dear?  It cannot be<br/>But that success attends him; if mishap,<br/>Ere this he had returned, with fury driven<br/>By his avengers; since no place like this<br/>Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.<br/>Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,<br/>Wings growing, and dominion given me large<br/>Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on,<br/>Or sympathy, or some connatural force,<br/>Powerful at greatest distance to unite,<br/>With secret amity, things of like kind,<br/>By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade<br/>Inseparable, must with me along;<br/>For Death from Sin no power can separate.<br/>But, lest the difficulty of passing back<br/>Stay his return perhaps over this gulf<br/>Impassable, impervious; let us try<br/>Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine<br/>Not unagreeable, to found a path<br/>Over this main from Hell to that new world,<br/>Where Satan now prevails; a monument<br/>Of merit high to all the infernal host,<br/>Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,<br/>Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.<br/>Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn<br/>By this new-felt attraction and instinct.<br/>Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.<br/>Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong,<br/>Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err<br/>The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw<br/>Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste<br/>The savour of death from all things there that live:<br/>Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest<br/>Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.<br/>So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell<br/>Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock<br/>Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,<br/>Against the day of battle, to a field,<br/>Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured<br/>With scent of living carcasses designed<br/>For death, the following day, in bloody fight:<br/>So scented the grim Feature, and upturned<br/>His nostril wide into the murky air;<br/>Sagacious of his quarry from so far.<br/>Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste<br/>Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,<br/>Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great)<br/>Hovering upon the waters, what they met<br/>Solid or slimy, as in raging sea<br/>Tost up and down, together crouded drove,<br/>From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell;<br/>As when two polar winds, blowing adverse<br/>Upon the Cronian sea, together drive<br/>Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way<br/>Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich<br/>Cathaian coast.  The aggregated soil<br/>Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry,<br/>As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm<br/>As Delos, floating once; the rest his look<br/>Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move;<br/>And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate,<br/>Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach<br/>They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on<br/>Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge<br/>Of length prodigious, joining to the wall<br/>Immoveable of this now fenceless world,<br/>Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,<br/>Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.<br/>So, if great things to small may be compared,<br/>Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke,<br/>From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,<br/>Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont<br/>Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,<br/>And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.<br/>Now had they brought the work by wonderous art<br/>Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock,<br/>Over the vexed abyss, following the track<br/>Of Satan to the self-same place where he<br/>First lighted from his wing, and landed safe<br/>From out of Chaos, to the outside bare<br/>Of this round world:  With pins of adamant<br/>And chains they made all fast, too fast they made<br/>And durable!  And now in little space<br/>The confines met of empyrean Heaven,<br/>And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell<br/>With long reach interposed; three several ways<br/>In sight, to each of these three places led.<br/>And now their way to Earth they had descried,<br/>To Paradise first tending; when, behold!<br/>Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,<br/>Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering<br/>His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose:<br/>Disguised he came; but those his children dear<br/>Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.<br/>He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk<br/>Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape,<br/>To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act<br/>By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded<br/>Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought<br/>Vain covertures; but when he saw descend<br/>The Son of God to judge them, terrified<br/>He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun<br/>The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath<br/>Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned<br/>By night, and listening where the hapless pair<br/>Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,<br/>Thence gathered his own doom; which understood<br/>Not instant, but of future time, with joy<br/>And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned;<br/>And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot<br/>Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped<br/>Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.<br/>Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight<br/>Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased.<br/>Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair<br/>Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.<br/>O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,<br/>Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own;<br/>Thou art their author, and prime architect:<br/>For I no sooner in my heart divined,<br/>My heart, which by a secret harmony<br/>Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,<br/>That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks<br/>Now also evidence, but straight I felt,<br/>Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,<br/>That I must after thee, with this thy son;<br/>Such fatal consequence unites us three!<br/>Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,<br/>Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure<br/>Detain from following thy illustrious track.<br/>Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined<br/>Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered<br/>To fortify thus far, and overlay,<br/>With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.<br/>Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won<br/>What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained<br/>With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged<br/>Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign,<br/>There didst not; there let him still victor sway,<br/>As battle hath adjudged; from this new world<br/>Retiring, by his own doom alienated;<br/>And henceforth monarchy with thee divide<br/>Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,<br/>His quadrature, from thy orbicular world;<br/>Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.<br/>Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.<br/>Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both;<br/>High proof ye now have given to be the race<br/>Of Satan (for I glory in the name,<br/>Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,)<br/>Amply have merited of me, of all<br/>The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door<br/>Triumphal with triumphal act have met,<br/>Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm,<br/>Hell and this world, one realm, one continent<br/>Of easy thorough-fare.  Therefore, while I<br/>Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,<br/>To my associate Powers, them to acquaint<br/>With these successes, and with them rejoice;<br/>You two this way, among these numerous orbs,<br/>All yours, right down to Paradise descend;<br/>There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth<br/>Dominion exercise and in the air,<br/>Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;<br/>Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.<br/>My substitutes I send ye, and create<br/>Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might<br/>Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now<br/>My hold of this new kingdom all depends,<br/>Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.<br/>If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell<br/>No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!<br/>So saying he dismissed them; they with speed<br/>Their course through thickest constellations held,<br/>Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,<br/>And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse<br/>Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down<br/>The causey to Hell-gate:  On either side<br/>Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,<br/>And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,<br/>That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate,<br/>Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,<br/>And all about found desolate; for those,<br/>Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,<br/>Flown to the upper world; the rest were all<br/>Far to the inland retired, about the walls<br/>Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat<br/>Of Lucifer, so by allusion called<br/>Of that bright star to Satan paragoned;<br/>There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand<br/>In council sat, solicitous what chance<br/>Might intercept their emperour sent; so he<br/>Departing gave command, and they observed.<br/>As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,<br/>By Astracan, over the snowy plains,<br/>Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns<br/>Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond<br/>The realm of Aladule, in his retreat<br/>To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late<br/>Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell<br/>Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch<br/>Round their metropolis; and now expecting<br/>Each hour their great adventurer, from the search<br/>Of foreign worlds:  He through the midst unmarked,<br/>In show plebeian Angel militant<br/>Of lowest order, passed; and from the door<br/>Of that Plutonian hall, invisible<br/>Ascended his high throne; which, under state<br/>Of richest texture spread, at the upper end<br/>Was placed in regal lustre.  Down a while<br/>He sat, and round about him saw unseen:<br/>At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head<br/>And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad<br/>With what permissive glory since his fall<br/>Was left him, or false glitter:  All amazed<br/>At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng<br/>Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,<br/>Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim:<br/>Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers,<br/>Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy<br/>Congratulant approached him; who with hand<br/>Silence, and with these words attention, won.<br/>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;<br/>For in possession such, not only of right,<br/>I call ye, and declare ye now; returned<br/>Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth<br/>Triumphant out of this infernal pit<br/>Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,<br/>And dungeon of our tyrant:  Now possess,<br/>As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven<br/>Little inferiour, by my adventure hard<br/>With peril great achieved.  Long were to tell<br/>What I have done; what suffered;with what pain<br/>Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep<br/>Of horrible confusion; over which<br/>By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,<br/>To expedite your glorious march; but I<br/>Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride<br/>The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb<br/>Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild;<br/>That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed<br/>My journey strange, with clamorous uproar<br/>Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found<br/>The new created world, which fame in Heaven<br/>Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful<br/>Of absolute perfection! therein Man<br/>Placed in a Paradise, by our exile<br/>Made happy:  Him by fraud I have seduced<br/>From his Creator; and, the more to encrease<br/>Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat<br/>Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up<br/>Both his beloved Man, and all his world,<br/>To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,<br/>Without our hazard, labour, or alarm;<br/>To range in, and to dwell, and over Man<br/>To rule, as over all he should have ruled.<br/>True is, me also he hath judged, or rather<br/>Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape<br/>Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,<br/>Is enmity which he will put between<br/>Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel;<br/>His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:<br/>A world who would not purchase with a bruise,<br/>Or much more grievous pain?--Ye have the account<br/>Of my performance:  What remains, ye Gods,<br/>But up, and enter now into full bliss?<br/>So having said, a while he stood, expecting<br/>Their universal shout, and high applause,<br/>To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears<br/>On all sides, from innumerable tongues,<br/>A dismal universal hiss, the sound<br/>Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long<br/>Had leisure, wondering at himself now more,<br/>His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare;<br/>His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining<br/>Each other, till supplanted down he fell<br/>A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,<br/>Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power<br/>Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,<br/>According to his doom: he would have spoke,<br/>But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue<br/>To forked tongue; for now were all transformed<br/>Alike, to serpents all, as accessories<br/>To his bold riot:  Dreadful was the din<br/>Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now<br/>With complicated monsters head and tail,<br/>Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,<br/>Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear,<br/>And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil<br/>Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle<br/>Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst,<br/>Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun<br/>Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime,<br/>Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed<br/>Above the rest still to retain; they all<br/>Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,<br/>Where all yet left of that revolted rout,<br/>Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array;<br/>Sublime with expectation when to see<br/>In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;<br/>They saw, but other sight instead! a croud<br/>Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell,<br/>And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw,<br/>They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms,<br/>Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;<br/>And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form<br/>Catched, by contagion; like in punishment,<br/>As in their crime.  Thus was the applause they meant,<br/>Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame<br/>Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood<br/>A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,<br/>His will who reigns above, to aggravate<br/>Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that<br/>Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve<br/>Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange<br/>Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining<br/>For one forbidden tree a multitude<br/>Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;<br/>Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,<br/>Though to delude them sent, could not abstain;<br/>But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees<br/>Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks<br/>That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked<br/>The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew<br/>Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;<br/>This more delusive, not the touch, but taste<br/>Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay<br/>Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit<br/>Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste<br/>With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,<br/>Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,<br/>With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,<br/>With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell<br/>Into the same illusion, not as Man<br/>Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued<br/>And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,<br/>Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed;<br/>Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo,<br/>This annual humbling certain numbered days,<br/>To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.<br/>However, some tradition they dispersed<br/>Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,<br/>And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called<br/>Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide--<br/>Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule<br/>Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven<br/>And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.<br/>Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair<br/>Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before,<br/>Once actual; now in body, and to dwell<br/>Habitual habitant; behind her Death,<br/>Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet<br/>On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.<br/>Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!<br/>What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned<br/>With travel difficult, not better far<br/>Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch,<br/>Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?<br/>Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.<br/>To me, who with eternal famine pine,<br/>Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven;<br/>There best, where most with ravine I may meet;<br/>Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems<br/>To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.<br/>To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.<br/>Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,<br/>Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl;<br/>No homely morsels! and, whatever thing<br/>The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared;<br/>Till I, in Man residing, through the race,<br/>His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect;<br/>And season him thy last and sweetest prey.<br/>This said, they both betook them several ways,<br/>Both to destroy, or unimmortal make<br/>All kinds, and for destruction to mature<br/>Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,<br/>From his transcendent seat the Saints among,<br/>To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.<br/>See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance<br/>To waste and havock yonder world, which I<br/>So fair and good created; and had still<br/>Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man<br/>Let in these wasteful furies, who impute<br/>Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell<br/>And his adherents, that with so much ease<br/>I suffer them to enter and possess<br/>A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem<br/>To gratify my scornful enemies,<br/>That laugh, as if, transported with some fit<br/>Of passion, I to them had quitted all,<br/>At random yielded up to their misrule;<br/>And know not that I called, and drew them thither,<br/>My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth<br/>Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed<br/>On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst<br/>With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling<br/>Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,<br/>Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,<br/>Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell<br/>For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.<br/>Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure<br/>To sanctity, that shall receive no stain:<br/>Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.<br/>He ended, and the heavenly audience loud<br/>Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,<br/>Through multitude that sung:  Just are thy ways,<br/>Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;<br/>Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,<br/>Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom<br/>New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,<br/>Or down from Heaven descend.--Such was their song;<br/>While the Creator, calling forth by name<br/>His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,<br/>As sorted best with present things.  The sun<br/>Had first his precept so to move, so shine,<br/>As might affect the earth with cold and heat<br/>Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call<br/>Decrepit winter; from the south to bring<br/>Solstitial summer's heat.  To the blanc moon<br/>Her office they prescribed; to the other five<br/>Their planetary motions, and aspects,<br/>In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,<br/>Of noxious efficacy, and when to join<br/>In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed<br/>Their influence malignant when to shower,<br/>Which of them rising with the sun, or falling,<br/>Should prove tempestuous:  To the winds they set<br/>Their corners, when with bluster to confound<br/>Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll<br/>With terrour through the dark aereal hall.<br/>Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse<br/>The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more,<br/>From the sun's axle; they with labour pushed<br/>Oblique the centrick globe:  Some say, the sun<br/>Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road<br/>Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven<br/>Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,<br/>Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain<br/>By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,<br/>As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change<br/>Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring<br/>Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers,<br/>Equal in days and nights, except to those<br/>Beyond the polar circles; to them day<br/>Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun,<br/>To recompense his distance, in their sight<br/>Had rounded still the horizon, and not known<br/>Or east or west; which had forbid the snow<br/>From cold Estotiland, and south as far<br/>Beneath Magellan.  At that tasted fruit<br/>The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned<br/>His course intended; else, how had the world<br/>Inhabited, though sinless, more than now,<br/>Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?<br/>These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced<br/>Like change on sea and land; sideral blast,<br/>Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot,<br/>Corrupt and pestilent:  Now from the north<br/>Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore,<br/>Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice,<br/>And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw,<br/>Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud,<br/>And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn;<br/>With adverse blast upturns them from the south<br/>Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds<br/>From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce,<br/>Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds,<br/>Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise,<br/>Sirocco and Libecchio.  Thus began<br/>Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first,<br/>Daughter of Sin, among the irrational<br/>Death introduced, through fierce antipathy:<br/>Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl,<br/>And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving,<br/>Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe<br/>Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim,<br/>Glared on him passing.  These were from without<br/>The growing miseries, which Adam saw<br/>Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,<br/>To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within;<br/>And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,<br/>Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.<br/>O miserable of happy!  Is this the end<br/>Of this new glorious world, and me so late<br/>The glory of that glory, who now become<br/>Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face<br/>Of God, whom to behold was then my highth<br/>Of happiness!--Yet well, if here would end<br/>The misery; I deserved it, and would bear<br/>My own deservings; but this will not serve:<br/>All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,<br/>Is propagated curse.  O voice, once heard<br/>Delightfully, Encrease and multiply;<br/>Now death to hear! for what can I encrease,<br/>Or multiply, but curses on my head?<br/>Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling<br/>The evil on him brought by me, will curse<br/>My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure,<br/>For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks<br/>Shall be the execration: so, besides<br/>Mine own that bide upon me, all from me<br/>Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound;<br/>On me, as on their natural center, light<br/>Heavy, though in their place.  O fleeting joys<br/>Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!<br/>Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay<br/>To mould me Man? did I solicit thee<br/>From darkness to promote me, or here place<br/>In this delicious garden?  As my will<br/>Concurred not to my being, it were but right<br/>And equal to reduce me to my dust;<br/>Desirous to resign and render back<br/>All I received; unable to perform<br/>Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold<br/>The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,<br/>Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added<br/>The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable<br/>Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out<br/>To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet<br/>Mortality my sentence, and be earth<br/>Insensible!  How glad would lay me down<br/>As in my mother's lap!  There I should rest,<br/>And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more<br/>Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse<br/>To me, and to my offspring, would torment me<br/>With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt<br/>Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die;<br/>Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man<br/>Which God inspired, cannot together perish<br/>With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave,<br/>Or in some other dismal place, who knows<br/>But I shall die a living death?  O thought<br/>Horrid, if true!  Yet why? It was but breath<br/>Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life<br/>And sin?  The body properly had neither,<br/>All of me then shall die: let this appease<br/>The doubt, since human reach no further knows.<br/>For though the Lord of all be infinite,<br/>Is his wrath also?  Be it, Man is not so,<br/>But mortal doomed.  How can he exercise<br/>Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?<br/>Can he make deathless death?  That were to make<br/>Strange contradiction, which to God himself<br/>Impossible is held; as argument<br/>Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out,<br/>For anger's sake, finite to infinite,<br/>In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour,<br/>Satisfied never?  That were to extend<br/>His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law;<br/>By which all causes else, according still<br/>To the reception of their matter, act;<br/>Not to the extent of their own sphere.  But say<br/>That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,<br/>Bereaving sense, but endless misery<br/>From this day onward; which I feel begun<br/>Both in me, and without me; and so last<br/>To perpetuity;--Ay me!that fear<br/>Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution<br/>On my defenceless head; both Death and I<br/>Am found eternal, and incorporate both;<br/>Nor I on my part single; in me all<br/>Posterity stands cursed:  Fair patrimony<br/>That I must leave ye, Sons!  O, were I able<br/>To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!<br/>So disinherited, how would you bless<br/>Me, now your curse!  Ah, why should all mankind,<br/>For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned,<br/>It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed,<br/>But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved<br/>Not to do only, but to will the same<br/>With me?  How can they then acquitted stand<br/>In sight of God?  Him, after all disputes,<br/>Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain,<br/>And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still<br/>But to my own conviction: first and last<br/>On me, me only, as the source and spring<br/>Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;<br/>So might the wrath!  Fond wish!couldst thou support<br/>That burden, heavier than the earth to bear;<br/>Than all the world much heavier, though divided<br/>With that bad Woman?  Thus, what thou desirest,<br/>And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope<br/>Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable<br/>Beyond all past example and future;<br/>To Satan only like both crime and doom.<br/>O Conscience! into what abyss of fears<br/>And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which<br/>I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!<br/>Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,<br/>Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell,<br/>Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air<br/>Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom;<br/>Which to his evil conscience represented<br/>All things with double terrour:  On the ground<br/>Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft<br/>Cursed his creation;  Death as oft accused<br/>Of tardy execution, since denounced<br/>The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,<br/>Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke<br/>To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,<br/>Justice Divine not hasten to be just?<br/>But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine<br/>Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,<br/>O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!<br/>With other echo late I taught your shades<br/>To answer, and resound far other song.--<br/>Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,<br/>Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,<br/>Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:<br/>But her with stern regard he thus repelled.<br/>Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best<br/>Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false<br/>And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,<br/>Like his, and colour serpentine, may show<br/>Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee<br/>Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended<br/>To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee<br/>I had persisted happy; had not thy pride<br/>And wandering vanity, when least was safe,<br/>Rejected my forewarning, and disdained<br/>Not to be trusted; longing to be seen,<br/>Though by the Devil himself; him overweening<br/>To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting,<br/>Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee<br/>To trust thee from my side; imagined wise,<br/>Constant, mature, proof against all assaults;<br/>And understood not all was but a show,<br/>Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib<br/>Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,<br/>More to the part sinister, from me drawn;<br/>Well if thrown out, as supernumerary<br/>To my just number found.  O! why did God,<br/>Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven<br/>With Spirits masculine, create at last<br/>This novelty on earth, this fair defect<br/>Of nature, and not fill the world at once<br/>With Men, as Angels, without feminine;<br/>Or find some other way to generate<br/>Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen,<br/>And more that shall befall; innumerable<br/>Disturbances on earth through female snares,<br/>And strait conjunction with this sex: for either<br/>He never shall find out fit mate, but such<br/>As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;<br/>Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain<br/>Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained<br/>By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld<br/>By parents; or his happiest choice too late<br/>Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound<br/>To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:<br/>Which infinite calamity shall cause<br/>To human life, and houshold peace confound.<br/>He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,<br/>Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing<br/>And tresses all disordered, at his feet<br/>Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought<br/>His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.<br/>Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven<br/>What love sincere, and reverence in my heart<br/>I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,<br/>Unhappily deceived!  Thy suppliant<br/>I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,<br/>Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,<br/>Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress,<br/>My only strength and stay:  Forlorn of thee,<br/>Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?<br/>While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,<br/>Between us two let there be peace; both joining,<br/>As joined in injuries, one enmity<br/>Against a foe by doom express assigned us,<br/>That cruel Serpent:  On me exercise not<br/>Thy hatred for this misery befallen;<br/>On me already lost, me than thyself<br/>More miserable!  Both have sinned;but thou<br/>Against God only; I against God and thee;<br/>And to the place of judgement will return,<br/>There with my cries importune Heaven; that all<br/>The sentence, from thy head removed, may light<br/>On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe;<br/>Me, me only, just object of his ire!<br/>She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,<br/>Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault<br/>Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought<br/>Commiseration:  Soon his heart relented<br/>Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,<br/>Now at his feet submissive in distress;<br/>Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,<br/>His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid:<br/>As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,<br/>And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.<br/>Unwary, and too desirous, as before,<br/>So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest<br/>The punishment all on thyself; alas!<br/>Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain<br/>His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part,<br/>And my displeasure bearest so ill.  If prayers<br/>Could alter high decrees, I to that place<br/>Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,<br/>That on my head all might be visited;<br/>Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,<br/>To me committed, and by me exposed.<br/>But rise;--let us no more contend, nor blame<br/>Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive<br/>In offices of love, how we may lighten<br/>Each other's burden, in our share of woe;<br/>Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see,<br/>Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil;<br/>A long day's dying, to augment our pain;<br/>And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived.<br/>To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.<br/>Adam, by sad experiment I know<br/>How little weight my words with thee can find,<br/>Found so erroneous; thence by just event<br/>Found so unfortunate:  Nevertheless,<br/>Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place<br/>Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain<br/>Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart<br/>Living or dying, from thee I will not hide<br/>What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,<br/>Tending to some relief of our extremes,<br/>Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,<br/>As in our evils, and of easier choice.<br/>If care of our descent perplex us most,<br/>Which must be born to certain woe, devoured<br/>By Death at last; and miserable it is<br/>To be to others cause of misery,<br/>Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring<br/>Into this cursed world a woeful race,<br/>That after wretched life must be at last<br/>Food for so foul a monster; in thy power<br/>It lies, yet ere conception to prevent<br/>The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.<br/>Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death<br/>Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two<br/>Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.<br/>But if thou judge it hard and difficult,<br/>Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain<br/>From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet;<br/>And with desire to languish without hope,<br/>Before the present object languishing<br/>With like desire; which would be misery<br/>And torment less than none of what we dread;<br/>Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free<br/>From what we fear for both, let us make short, --<br/>Let us seek Death; -- or, he not found, supply<br/>With our own hands his office on ourselves:<br/>Why stand we longer shivering under fears,<br/>That show no end but death, and have the power,<br/>Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,<br/>Destruction with destruction to destroy? --<br/>She ended here, or vehement despair<br/>Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts<br/>Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.<br/>But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,<br/>To better hopes his more attentive mind<br/>Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.<br/>Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems<br/>To argue in thee something more sublime<br/>And excellent, than what thy mind contemns;<br/>But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes<br/>That excellence thought in thee; and implies,<br/>Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret<br/>For loss of life and pleasure overloved.<br/>Or if thou covet death, as utmost end<br/>Of misery, so thinking to evade<br/>The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God<br/>Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so<br/>To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death,<br/>So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain<br/>We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts<br/>Of contumacy will provoke the Highest<br/>To make death in us live:  Then let us seek<br/>Some safer resolution, which methinks<br/>I have in view, calling to mind with heed<br/>Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise<br/>The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless<br/>Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,<br/>Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived<br/>Against us this deceit:  To crush his head<br/>Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost<br/>By death brought on ourselves, or childless days<br/>Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe<br/>Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we<br/>Instead shall double ours upon our heads.<br/>No more be mentioned then of violence<br/>Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness,<br/>That cuts us off from hope; and savours only<br/>Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,<br/>Reluctance against God and his just yoke<br/>Laid on our necks.  Remember with what mild<br/>And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,<br/>Without wrath or reviling; we expected<br/>Immediate dissolution, which we thought<br/>Was meant by death that day; when lo!to thee<br/>Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,<br/>And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy,<br/>Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope<br/>Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn<br/>My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;<br/>My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold<br/>Or heat should injure us, his timely care<br/>Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands<br/>Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;<br/>How much more, if we pray him, will his ear<br/>Be open, and his heart to pity incline,<br/>And teach us further by what means to shun<br/>The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!<br/>Which now the sky, with various face, begins<br/>To show us in this mountain; while the winds<br/>Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks<br/>Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek<br/>Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish<br/>Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star<br/>Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams<br/>Reflected may with matter sere foment;<br/>Or, by collision of two bodies, grind<br/>The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds<br/>Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,<br/>Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down<br/>Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine;<br/>And sends a comfortable heat from far,<br/>Which might supply the sun:  Such fire to use,<br/>And what may else be remedy or cure<br/>To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,<br/>He will instruct us praying, and of grace<br/>Beseeching him; so as we need not fear<br/>To pass commodiously this life, sustained<br/>By him with many comforts, till we end<br/>In dust, our final rest and native home.<br/>What better can we do, than, to the place<br/>Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall<br/>Before him reverent; and there confess<br/>Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears<br/>Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air<br/>Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
