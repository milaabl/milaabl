  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ "By the Waters of Babylon." by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    In the valley of waters we wept on the day<br/>When the host of the Stranger made Salem his prey;<br/>And our heads on our bosoms all droopingly lay,<br/>And our hearts were so full of the land far away!<br/><br/>The song they demanded in vain--it lay still<br/>In our souls as the wind that hath died on the hill--<br/>They called for the harp--but our blood they shall spill<br/>Ere our right hands shall teach them one tone of their skill.<br/><br/>All stringlessly hung in the willow's sad tree,<br/>As dead as her dead-leaf, those mute harps must be:<br/>Our hands may be fettered--our tears still are free<br/>For our God--and our Glory--and Sion, Oh _Thee!_
</p>
