# üíÆ Fragments of an Unfinished Drama by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    SCENE.--BEFORE THE CAVERN OF THE INDIAN ENCHANTRESS.<br/><br/>THE ENCHANTRESS COMES FORTH.<br/><br/>ENCHANTRESS:<br/>He came like a dream in the dawn of life,<br/>He fled like a shadow before its noon;<br/>He is gone, and my peace is turned to strife,<br/>And I wander and wane like the weary moon.<br/>O, sweet Echo, wake,<br/>And for my sake<br/>Make answer the while my heart shall break!<br/><br/>But my heart has a music which Echo's lips,<br/>Though tender and true, yet can answer not,<br/>And the shadow that moves in the soul's eclipse<br/>Can return not the kiss by his now forgot;<br/>Sweet lips! he who hath<br/>On my desolate path<br/>Cast the darkness of absence, worse than death!<br/><br/>[THE ENCHANTRESS MAKES HER SPELL: SHE IS ANSWERED BY A SPIRIT.]<br/><br/>SPIRIT:<br/>Within the silent centre of the earth<br/>My mansion is; where I have lived insphered<br/>From the beginning, and around my sleep<br/>Have woven all the wondrous imagery<br/>Of this dim spot, which mortals call the world;<br/>Infinite depths of unknown elements<br/>Massed into one impenetrable mask;<br/>Sheets of immeasurable fire, and veins<br/>Of gold and stone, and adamantine iron.<br/>And as a veil in which I walk through Heaven<br/>I have wrought mountains, seas, and waves, and clouds,<br/>And lastly light, whose interfusion dawns<br/>In the dark space of interstellar air.<br/><br/>ANOTHER SCENE.<br/><br/>INDIAN YOUTH AND LADY.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>And, if my grief should still be dearer to me<br/>Than all the pleasures in the world beside,<br/>Why would you lighten it?--<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>I offer only<br/>That which I seek, some human sympathy<br/>In this mysterious island.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>Oh! my friend,<br/>My sister, my beloved!--What do I say?<br/>My brain is dizzy, and I scarce know whether<br/>I speak to thee or her.<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>Peace, perturbed heart!<br/>I am to thee only as thou to mine,<br/>The passing wind which heals the brow at noon,<br/>And may strike cold into the breast at night,<br/>Yet cannot linger where it soothes the most,<br/>Or long soothe could it linger.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>But you said<br/>You also loved?<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>Loved! Oh, I love. Methinks<br/>This word of love is fit for all the world,<br/>And that for gentle hearts another name<br/>Would speak of gentler thoughts than the world owns.<br/>I have loved.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>And thou lovest not? if so,<br/>Young as thou art thou canst afford to weep.<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>Oh! would that I could claim exemption<br/>From all the bitterness of that sweet name.<br/>I loved, I love, and when I love no more<br/>Let joys and grief perish, and leave despair<br/>To ring the knell of youth. He stood beside me,<br/>The embodied vision of the brightest dream,<br/>Which like a dawn heralds the day of life;<br/>The shadow of his presence made my world<br/>A Paradise. All familiar things he touched,<br/>All common words he spoke, became to me<br/>Like forms and sounds of a diviner world.<br/>He was as is the sun in his fierce youth,<br/>As terrible and lovely as a tempest;<br/>He came, and went, and left me what I am.<br/>Alas! Why must I think how oft we two<br/>Have sate together near the river springs,<br/>Under the green pavilion which the willow<br/>Spreads on the floor of the unbroken fountain,<br/>Strewn, by the nurslings that linger there,<br/>Over that islet paved with flowers and moss,<br/>While the musk-rose leaves, like flakes of crimson snow,<br/>Showered on us, and the dove mourned in the pine,<br/>Sad prophetess of sorrows not her own?<br/>The crane returned to her unfrozen haunt,<br/>And the false cuckoo bade the spray good morn;<br/>And on a wintry bough the widowed bird,<br/>Hid in the deepest night of ivy-leaves,<br/>Renewed the vigils of a sleepless sorrow.<br/>I, left like her, and leaving one like her,<br/>Alike abandoned and abandoning<br/>(Oh! unlike her in this!) the gentlest youth,<br/>Whose love had made my sorrows dear to him,<br/>Even as my sorrow made his love to me!<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>One curse of Nature stamps in the same mould<br/>The features of the wretched; and they are<br/>As like as violet to violet,<br/>When memory, the ghost, their odours keeps<br/>Mid the cold relics of abandoned joy.--<br/>Proceed.<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>He was a simple innocent boy.<br/>I loved him well, but not as he desired;<br/>Yet even thus he was content to be:--<br/>A short content, for I was--<br/><br/>INDIAN [ASIDE]:<br/>God of Heaven!<br/>From such an islet, such a river-spring--!<br/>I dare not ask her if there stood upon it<br/>A pleasure-dome surmounted by a crescent,<br/>With steps to the blue water.<br/>[ALOUD.]<br/>It may be<br/>That Nature masks in life several copies<br/>Of the same lot, so that the sufferers<br/>May feel another's sorrow as their own,<br/>And find in friendship what they lost in love.<br/>That cannot be: yet it is strange that we,<br/>From the same scene, by the same path to this<br/>Realm of abandonment-- But speak! your breath--<br/>Your breath is like soft music, your words are<br/>The echoes of a voice which on my heart<br/>Sleeps like a melody of early days.<br/>But as you said--<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>He was so awful, yet<br/>So beautiful in mystery and terror,<br/>Calming me as the loveliness of heaven<br/>Soothes the unquiet sea:--and yet not so,<br/>For he seemed stormy, and would often seem<br/>A quenchless sun masked in portentous clouds;<br/>For such his thoughts, and even his actions were;<br/>But he was not of them, nor they of him,<br/>But as they hid his splendour from the earth.<br/>Some said he was a man of blood and peril,<br/>And steeped in bitter infamy to the lips.<br/>More need was there I should be innocent,<br/>More need that I should be most true and kind,<br/>And much more need that there should be found one<br/>To share remorse and scorn and solitude,<br/>And all the ills that wait on those who do<br/>The tasks of ruin in the world of life.<br/>He fled, and I have followed him.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>Such a one<br/>Is he who was the winter of my peace.<br/>But, fairest stranger, when didst thou depart<br/>From the far hills where rise the springs of India?<br/>How didst thou pass the intervening sea?<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>If I be sure I am not dreaming now,<br/>I should not doubt to say it was a dream.<br/>Methought a star came down from heaven,<br/>And rested mid the plants of India,<br/>Which I had given a shelter from the frost<br/>Within my chamber. There the meteor lay,<br/>Panting forth light among the leaves and flowers,<br/>As if it lived, and was outworn with speed;<br/>Or that it loved, and passion made the pulse<br/>Of its bright life throb like an anxious heart,<br/>Till it diffused itself; and all the chamber<br/>And walls seemed melted into emerald fire<br/>That burned not; in the midst of which appeared<br/>A spirit like a child, and laughed aloud<br/>A thrilling peal of such sweet merriment<br/>As made the blood tingle in my warm feet:<br/>Then bent over a vase, and murmuring<br/>Low, unintelligible melodies,<br/>Placed something in the mould like melon-seeds,<br/>And slowly faded, and in place of it<br/>A soft hand issued from the veil of fire,<br/>Holding a cup like a magnolia flower,<br/>And poured upon the earth within the vase<br/>The element with which it overflowed,<br/>Brighter than morning light, and purer than<br/>The water of the springs of Himalah.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>You waked not?<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>Not until my dream became<br/>Like a child's legend on the tideless sand.<br/>Which the first foam erases half, and half<br/>Leaves legible. At length I rose, and went,<br/>Visiting my flowers from pot to pot, and thought<br/>To set new cuttings in the empty urns,<br/>And when I came to that beside the lattice,<br/>I saw two little dark-green leaves<br/>Lifting the light mould at their birth, and then<br/>I half-remembered my forgotten dream.<br/>And day by day, green as a gourd in June,<br/>The plant grew fresh and thick, yet no one knew<br/>What plant it was; its stem and tendrils seemed<br/>Like emerald snakes, mottled and diamonded<br/>With azure mail and streaks of woven silver;<br/>And all the sheaths that folded the dark buds<br/>Rose like the crest of cobra-di-capel,<br/>Until the golden eye of the bright flower,<br/>Through the dark lashes of those veined lids,<br/>...disencumbered of their silent sleep,<br/>Gazed like a star into the morning light.<br/>Its leaves were delicate, you almost saw<br/>The pulses<br/>With which the purple velvet flower was fed<br/>To overflow, and like a poet's heart<br/>Changing bright fancy to sweet sentiment,<br/>Changed half the light to fragrance. It soon fell,<br/>And to a green and dewy embryo-fruit<br/>Left all its treasured beauty. Day by day<br/>I nursed the plant, and on the double flute<br/>Played to it on the sunny winter days<br/>Soft melodies, as sweet as April rain<br/>On silent leaves, and sang those words in which<br/>Passion makes Echo taunt the sleeping strings;<br/>And I would send tales of forgotten love<br/>Late into the lone night, and sing wild songs<br/>Of maids deserted in the olden time,<br/>And weep like a soft cloud in April's bosom<br/>Upon the sleeping eyelids of the plant,<br/>So that perhaps it dreamed that Spring was come,<br/>And crept abroad into the moonlight air,<br/>And loosened all its limbs, as, noon by noon,<br/>The sun averted less his oblique beam.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>And the plant died not in the frost?<br/><br/>LADY:<br/>It grew;<br/>And went out of the lattice which I left<br/>Half open for it, trailing its quaint spires<br/>Along the garden and across the lawn,<br/>And down the slope of moss and through the tufts<br/>Of wild-flower roots, and stumps of trees o'ergrown<br/>With simple lichens, and old hoary stones,<br/>On to the margin of the glassy pool,<br/>Even to a nook of unblown violets<br/>And lilies-of-the-valley yet unborn,<br/>Under a pine with ivy overgrown.<br/>And theme its fruit lay like a sleeping lizard<br/>Under the shadows; but when Spring indeed<br/>Came to unswathe her infants, and the lilies<br/>Peeped from their bright green masks to wonder at<br/>This shape of autumn couched in their recess,<br/>Then it dilated, and it grew until<br/>One half lay floating on the fountain wave,<br/>Whose pulse, elapsed in unlike sympathies,<br/>Kept time<br/>Among the snowy water-lily buds.<br/>Its shape was such as summer melody<br/>Of the south wind in spicy vales might give<br/>To some light cloud bound from the golden dawn<br/>To fairy isles of evening, and it seemed<br/>In hue and form that it had been a mirror<br/>Of all the hues and forms around it and<br/>Upon it pictured by the sunny beams<br/>Which, from the bright vibrations of the pool,<br/>Were thrown upon the rafters and the roof<br/>Of boughs and leaves, and on the pillared stems<br/>Of the dark sylvan temple, and reflections<br/>Of every infant flower and star of moss<br/>And veined leaf in the azure odorous air.<br/>And thus it lay in the Elysian calm<br/>Of its own beauty, floating on the line<br/>Which, like a film in purest space, divided<br/>The heaven beneath the water from the heaven<br/>Above the clouds; and every day I went<br/>Watching its growth and wondering;<br/>And as the day grew hot, methought I saw<br/>A glassy vapour dancing on the pool,<br/>And on it little quaint and filmy shapes.<br/>With dizzy motion, wheel and rise and fall,<br/>Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>O friend, sleep was a veil uplift from Heaven--<br/>As if Heaven dawned upon the world of dream--<br/>When darkness rose on the extinguished day<br/>Out of the eastern wilderness.<br/><br/>INDIAN:<br/>I too<br/>Have found a moment's paradise in sleep<br/>Half compensate a hell of waking sorrow.
