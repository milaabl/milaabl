# üíÆ Ginevra by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Wild, pale, and wonder-stricken, even as one<br/>Who staggers forth into the air and sun<br/>From the dark chamber of a mortal fever,<br/>Bewildered, and incapable, and ever<br/>Fancying strange comments in her dizzy brain<br/>Of usual shapes, till the familiar train<br/>Of objects and of persons passed like things<br/>Strange as a dreamer's mad imaginings,<br/>Ginevra from the nuptial altar went;<br/>The vows to which her lips had sworn assent<br/>Rung in her brain still with a jarring din,<br/>Deafening the lost intelligence within.<br/><br/>And so she moved under the bridal veil,<br/>Which made the paleness of her cheek more pale,<br/>And deepened the faint crimson of her mouth,<br/>And darkened her dark locks, as moonlight doth,--<br/>And of the gold and jewels glittering there<br/>She scarce felt conscious,--but the weary glare<br/>Lay like a chaos of unwelcome light,<br/>Vexing the sense with gorgeous undelight,<br/>A moonbeam in the shadow of a cloud<br/>Was less heavenly fair--her face was bowed,<br/>And as she passed, the diamonds in her hair<br/>Were mirrored in the polished marble stair<br/>Which led from the cathedral to the street;<br/>And ever as she went her light fair feet<br/>Erased these images.<br/><br/>The bride-maidens who round her thronging came,<br/>Some with a sense of self-rebuke and shame,<br/>Envying the unenviable; and others<br/>Making the joy which should have been another's<br/>Their own by gentle sympathy; and some<br/>Sighing to think of an unhappy home:<br/>Some few admiring what can ever lure<br/>Maidens to leave the heaven serene and pure<br/>Of parents' smiles for life's great cheat; a thing<br/>Bitter to taste, sweet in imagining.<br/><br/>But they are all dispersed--and, lo! she stands<br/>Looking in idle grief on her white hands,<br/>Alone within the garden now her own;<br/>And through the sunny air, with jangling tone,<br/>The music of the merry marriage-bells,<br/>Killing the azure silence, sinks and swells;--<br/>Absorbed like one within a dream who dreams<br/>That he is dreaming, until slumber seems<br/>A mockery of itself--when suddenly<br/>Antonio stood before her, pale as she.<br/>With agony, with sorrow, and with pride,<br/>He lifted his wan eyes upon the bride,<br/>And said--'Is this thy faith?' and then as one<br/>Whose sleeping face is stricken by the sun<br/>With light like a harsh voice, which bids him rise<br/>And look upon his day of life with eyes<br/>Which weep in vain that they can dream no more,<br/>Ginevra saw her lover, and forbore<br/>To shriek or faint, and checked the stifling blood<br/>Rushing upon her heart, and unsubdued<br/>Said--'Friend, if earthly violence or ill,<br/>Suspicion, doubt, or the tyrannic will<br/>Of parents, chance or custom, time or change,<br/>Or circumstance, or terror, or revenge,<br/>Or wildered looks, or words, or evil speech,<br/>With all their stings and venom can impeach<br/>Our love,--we love not:--if the grave which hides<br/>The victim from the tyrant, and divides<br/>The cheek that whitens from the eyes that dart<br/>Imperious inquisition to the heart<br/>That is another's, could dissever ours,<br/>We love not.'--'What! do not the silent hours<br/>Beckon thee to Gherardi's bridal bed?<br/>Is not that ring'--a pledge, he would have said,<br/>Of broken vows, but she with patient look<br/>The golden circle from her finger took,<br/>And said--'Accept this token of my faith,<br/>The pledge of vows to be absolved by death;<br/>And I am dead or shall be soon--my knell<br/>Will mix its music with that merry bell,<br/>Does it not sound as if they sweetly said<br/>"We toll a corpse out of the marriage-bed"?<br/>The flowers upon my bridal chamber strewn<br/>Will serve unfaded for my bier--so soon<br/>That even the dying violet will not die<br/>Before Ginevra.' The strong fantasy<br/>Had made her accents weaker and more weak,<br/>And quenched the crimson life upon her cheek,<br/>And glazed her eyes, and spread an atmosphere<br/>Round her, which chilled the burning noon with fear,<br/>Making her but an image of the thought<br/>Which, like a prophet or a shadow, brought<br/>News of the terrors of the coming time.<br/>Like an accuser branded with the crime<br/>He would have cast on a beloved friend,<br/>Whose dying eyes reproach not to the end<br/>The pale betrayer--he then with vain repentance<br/>Would share, he cannot now avert, the sentence--<br/>Antonio stood and would have spoken, when<br/>The compound voice of women and of men<br/>Was heard approaching; he retired, while she<br/>Was led amid the admiring company<br/>Back to the palace,--and her maidens soon<br/>Changed her attire for the afternoon,<br/>And left her at her own request to keep<br/>An hour of quiet rest:--like one asleep<br/>With open eyes and folded hands she lay,<br/>Pale in the light of the declining day.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the day sinks fast, the sun is set,<br/>And in the lighted hall the guests are met;<br/>The beautiful looked lovelier in the light<br/>Of love, and admiration, and delight<br/>Reflected from a thousand hearts and eyes,<br/>Kindling a momentary Paradise.<br/>This crowd is safer than the silent wood,<br/>Where love's own doubts disturb the solitude;<br/>On frozen hearts the fiery rain of wine<br/>Falls, and the dew of music more divine<br/>Tempers the deep emotions of the time<br/>To spirits cradled in a sunny clime:--<br/>How many meet, who never yet have met,<br/>To part too soon, but never to forget.<br/>How many saw the beauty, power and wit<br/>Of looks and words which ne'er enchanted yet;<br/>But life's familiar veil was now withdrawn,<br/>As the world leaps before an earthquake's dawn,<br/>And unprophetic of the coming hours,<br/>The matin winds from the expanded flowers<br/>Scatter their hoarded incense, and awaken<br/>The earth, until the dewy sleep is shaken<br/>From every living heart which it possesses,<br/>Through seas and winds, cities and wildernesses,<br/>As if the future and the past were all<br/>Treasured i' the instant;--so Gherardi's hall<br/>Laughed in the mirth of its lord's festival,<br/>Till some one asked--'Where is the Bride?' And then<br/>A bridesmaid went,--and ere she came again<br/>A silence fell upon the guests--a pause<br/>Of expectation, as when beauty awes<br/>All hearts with its approach, though unbeheld;<br/>Then wonder, and then fear that wonder quelled;--<br/>For whispers passed from mouth to ear which drew<br/>The colour from the hearer's cheeks, and flew<br/>Louder and swifter round the company;<br/>And then Gherardi entered with an eye<br/>Of ostentatious trouble, and a crowd<br/>Surrounded him, and some were weeping loud.<br/><br/>They found Ginevra dead! if it be death<br/>To lie without motion, or pulse, or breath,<br/>With waxen cheeks, and limbs cold, stiff, and white,<br/>And open eyes, whose fixed and glassy light<br/>Mocked at the speculation they had owned.<br/>If it be death, when there is felt around<br/>A smell of clay, a pale and icy glare,<br/>And silence, and a sense that lifts the hair<br/>From the scalp to the ankles, as it were<br/>Corruption from the spirit passing forth,<br/>And giving all it shrouded to the earth,<br/>And leaving as swift lightning in its flight<br/>Ashes, and smoke, and darkness: in our night<br/>Of thought we know thus much of death,--no more<br/>Than the unborn dream of our life before<br/>Their barks are wrecked on its inhospitable shore.<br/>The marriage feast and its solemnity<br/>Was turned to funeral pomp--the company,<br/>With heavy hearts and looks, broke up; nor they<br/>Who loved the dead went weeping on their way<br/>Alone, but sorrow mixed with sad surprise<br/>Loosened the springs of pity in all eyes,<br/>On which that form, whose fate they weep in vain,<br/>Will never, thought they, kindle smiles again.<br/>The lamps which, half extinguished in their haste,<br/>Gleamed few and faint o'er the abandoned feast,<br/>Showed as it were within the vaulted room<br/>A cloud of sorrow hanging, as if gloom<br/>Had passed out of men's minds into the air.<br/>Some few yet stood around Gherardi there,<br/>Friends and relations of the dead,--and he,<br/>A loveless man, accepted torpidly<br/>The consolation that he wanted not;<br/>Awe in the place of grief within him wrought.<br/>Their whispers made the solemn silence seem<br/>More still--some wept,...<br/>Some melted into tears without a sob,<br/>And some with hearts that might be heard to throb<br/>Leaned on the table and at intervals<br/>Shuddered to hear through the deserted halls<br/>And corridors the thrilling shrieks which came<br/>Upon the breeze of night, that shook the flame<br/>Of every torch and taper as it swept<br/>From out the chamber where the women kept;--<br/>Their tears fell on the dear companion cold<br/>Of pleasures now departed; then was knolled<br/>The bell of death, and soon the priests arrived,<br/>And finding Death their penitent had shrived,<br/>Returned like ravens from a corpse whereon<br/>A vulture has just feasted to the bone.<br/>And then the mourning women came.--<br/><br/>...
