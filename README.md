# üíÆ Granta. a Medley by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    (Reply of the Pythian Oracle to Philip of Macedon.)<br/><br/>Oh! could LE SAGE'S demon's gift<br/>  Be realis'd at my desire,<br/>This night my trembling form he'd lift<br/>  To place it on St. Mary's spire.<br/><br/>Then would, unroof'd, old Granta's halls,<br/>  Pedantic inmates full display;<br/>_Fellows_ who dream on _lawn_ or _stalls_,<br/>  The price of venal votes to pay.<br/><br/>Then would I view each rival wight,<br/>  PETTY and PALMERSTON survey;<br/>Who canvass there, with all their might,<br/>  Against the next elective day.<br/><br/>Lo! candidates and voters lie<br/>  All lull'd in sleep, a goodly number!<br/>A race renown'd for piety,<br/>  Whose conscience won't disturb their slumber.<br/><br/>Lord H---indeed, may not demur;<br/>  Fellows are sage, reflecting men:<br/>They know preferment can occur,<br/>  But very seldom,--_now_ and _then_.<br/><br/>They know the Chancellor has got<br/>  Some pretty livings in disposal:<br/>Each hopes that _one_ may be his _lot_,<br/>  And, therefore, smiles on his proposal.<br/><br/>Now from the soporific scene<br/>  I'll turn mine eye, as night grows later,<br/>To view, unheeded and unseen,<br/>  The studious sons of Alma Mater.<br/><br/>There, in apartments small and damp,<br/>  The candidate for college prizes,<br/>Sits poring by the midnight lamp;<br/>  Goes late to bed, yet early rises.<br/><br/>He surely well deserves to gain them,<br/>  With all the honours of his college,<br/>Who, striving hardly to obtain them,<br/>  Thus seeks unprofitable knowledge:<br/><br/>Who sacrifices hours of rest,<br/>  To scan precisely metres Attic;<br/>Or agitates his anxious breast,<br/>  In solving problems mathematic:<br/><br/>Who reads false quantities in Seale,<br/>  Or puzzles o'er the deep triangle;<br/>Depriv'd of many a wholesome meal;<br/>  In _barbarous Latin_ doom'd to wrangle:<br/><br/>Renouncing every pleasing page,<br/>  From authors of historic use;<br/>Preferring to the letter'd sage,<br/>  The square of the hypothenuse.<br/><br/>Still, harmless are these occupations,<br/>That hurt none but the hapless student,<br/>Compar'd with other recreations,<br/>Which bring together the imprudent;<br/><br/>Whose daring revels shock the sight,<br/>When vice and infamy combine,<br/>When Drunkenness and dice invite,<br/>As every sense is steep'd in wine.<br/><br/>Not so the methodistic crew,<br/>Who plans of reformation lay:<br/>In humble attitude they sue,<br/>And for the sins of others pray:<br/><br/>Forgetting that their pride of spirit,<br/>Their exultation in their trial,<br/>Detracts most largely from the merit<br/>Of all their boasted self-denial.<br/><br/>'Tis morn:--from these I turn my sight:<br/>What scene is this which meets the eye?<br/>A numerous crowd array'd in white,<br/>Across the green in numbers fly.<br/><br/>Loud rings in air the chapel bell;<br/>'Tis hush'd:--what sounds are these I hear?<br/>The organ's soft celestial swell<br/>Rolls deeply on the listening ear.<br/><br/>To this is join'd the sacred song,<br/>The royal minstrel's hallow'd strain;<br/>Though _he_ who hears the _music_ long,<br/>Will _never_ wish to _hear again_.<br/><br/>Our choir would scarcely be excus'd,<br/>E'en as a band of raw beginners;<br/>All mercy, now, must be refus'd<br/>To such a set of croaking sinners.<br/><br/>If David, when his toils were ended,<br/>Had heard these blockheads sing before him,<br/>To us his psalms had ne'er descended,--<br/>In furious mood he would have tore 'em.<br/><br/>The luckless Israelites, when taken<br/>By some inhuman tyrant's order,<br/>Were ask'd to sing, by joy forsaken,<br/>On Babylonian river's border.<br/><br/>Oh! had they sung in notes like these<br/>Inspir'd by stratagem or fear,<br/>They might have set their hearts at ease,<br/>The devil a soul had stay'd to hear.<br/><br/>But if I scribble longer now,<br/>The deuce a soul will _stay to read_;<br/>My pen is blunt, my ink is low;<br/>'Tis almost time to _stop_, _indeed_.<br/><br/>Therefore, farewell, old _Granta's_ spires!<br/>No more, like _Cleofas_, I fly;<br/>No more thy theme my Muse inspires:<br/>The reader's tir'd, and so am I.
