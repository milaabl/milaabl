# üíÆ Endymion: Book I by *John Keats*

<p>
    ENDYMION.<br/><br/>A Poetic Romance.<br/><br/>"THE STRETCHED METRE OF AN AN ANTIQUE SONG."<br/>INSCRIBED TO THE MEMORY OF THOMAS CHATTERTON.<br/><br/><br/>Book I<br/><br/><br/>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:<br/>Its loveliness increases; it will never<br/>Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br/>A bower quiet for us, and a sleep<br/>Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.<br/>Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing<br/>A flowery band to bind us to the earth,<br/>Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth<br/>Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,<br/>Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways<br/>Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,<br/>Some shape of beauty moves away the pall<br/>From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,<br/>Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon<br/>For simple sheep; and such are daffodils<br/>With the green world they live in; and clear rills<br/>That for themselves a cooling covert make<br/>'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,<br/>Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:<br/>And such too is the grandeur of the dooms<br/>We have imagined for the mighty dead;<br/>All lovely tales that we have heard or read:<br/>An endless fountain of immortal drink,<br/>Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.<br/><br/>  Nor do we merely feel these essences<br/>For one short hour; no, even as the trees<br/>That whisper round a temple become soon<br/>Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,<br/>The passion poesy, glories infinite,<br/>Haunt us till they become a cheering light<br/>Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,<br/>That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,<br/>They alway must be with us, or we die.<br/><br/>  Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I<br/>Will trace the story of Endymion.<br/>The very music of the name has gone<br/>Into my being, and each pleasant scene<br/>Is growing fresh before me as the green<br/>Of our own vallies: so I will begin<br/>Now while I cannot hear the city's din;<br/>Now while the early budders are just new,<br/>And run in mazes of the youngest hue<br/>About old forests; while the willow trails<br/>Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails<br/>Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year<br/>Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer<br/>My little boat, for many quiet hours,<br/>With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.<br/>Many and many a verse I hope to write,<br/>Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,<br/>Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees<br/>Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,<br/>I must be near the middle of my story.<br/>O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,<br/>See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,<br/>With universal tinge of sober gold,<br/>Be all about me when I make an end.<br/>And now at once, adventuresome, I send<br/>My herald thought into a wilderness:<br/>There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress<br/>My uncertain path with green, that I may speed<br/>Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.<br/><br/>  Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread<br/>A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed<br/>So plenteously all weed-hidden roots<br/>Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.<br/>And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,<br/>Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep<br/>A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,<br/>Never again saw he the happy pens<br/>Whither his brethren, bleating with content,<br/>Over the hills at every nightfall went.<br/>Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,<br/>That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever<br/>From the white flock, but pass'd unworried<br/>By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,<br/>Until it came to some unfooted plains<br/>Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains<br/>Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,<br/>Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,<br/>And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly<br/>To a wide lawn, whence one could only see<br/>Stems thronging all around between the swell<br/>Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell<br/>The freshness of the space of heaven above,<br/>Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove<br/>Would often beat its wings, and often too<br/>A little cloud would move across the blue.<br/><br/>  Full in the middle of this pleasantness<br/>There stood a marble altar, with a tress<br/>Of flowers budded newly; and the dew<br/>Had taken fairy phantasies to strew<br/>Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,<br/>And so the dawned light in pomp receive.<br/>For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire<br/>Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre<br/>Of brightness so unsullied, that therein<br/>A melancholy spirit well might win<br/>Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine<br/>Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine<br/>Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;<br/>The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run<br/>To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;<br/>Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass<br/>Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,<br/>To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.<br/><br/>  Now while the silent workings of the dawn<br/>Were busiest, into that self-same lawn<br/>All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped<br/>A troop of little children garlanded;<br/>Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry<br/>Earnestly round as wishing to espy<br/>Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited<br/>For many moments, ere their ears were sated<br/>With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then<br/>Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.<br/>Within a little space again it gave<br/>Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,<br/>To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking<br/>Through copse-clad vallies,--ere their death, oer-taking<br/>The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.<br/><br/>  And now, as deep into the wood as we<br/>Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light<br/>Fair faces and a rush of garments white,<br/>Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last<br/>Into the widest alley they all past,<br/>Making directly for the woodland altar.<br/>O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter<br/>In telling of this goodly company,<br/>Of their old piety, and of their glee:<br/>But let a portion of ethereal dew<br/>Fall on my head, and presently unmew<br/>My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,<br/>To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.<br/><br/>  Leading the way, young damsels danced along,<br/>Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;<br/>Each having a white wicker over brimm'd<br/>With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,<br/>A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks<br/>As may be read of in Arcadian books;<br/>Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,<br/>When the great deity, for earth too ripe,<br/>Let his divinity o'er-flowing die<br/>In music, through the vales of Thessaly:<br/>Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,<br/>And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound<br/>With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,<br/>Now coming from beneath the forest trees,<br/>A venerable priest full soberly,<br/>Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye<br/>Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,<br/>And after him his sacred vestments swept.<br/>From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,<br/>Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;<br/>And in his left he held a basket full<br/>Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:<br/>Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still<br/>Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.<br/>His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,<br/>Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth<br/>Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd<br/>Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud<br/>Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,<br/>Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd<br/>Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,<br/>Easily rolling so as scarce to mar<br/>The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:<br/>Who stood therein did seem of great renown<br/>Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,<br/>Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;<br/>And, for those simple times, his garments were<br/>A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,<br/>Was hung a silver bugle, and between<br/>His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.<br/>A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,<br/>To common lookers on, like one who dream'd<br/>Of idleness in groves Elysian:<br/>But there were some who feelingly could scan<br/>A lurking trouble in his nether lip,<br/>And see that oftentimes the reins would slip<br/>Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,<br/>And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,<br/>Of logs piled solemnly.--Ah, well-a-day,<br/>Why should our young Endymion pine away!<br/><br/>  Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,<br/>Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd<br/>To sudden veneration: women meek<br/>Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek<br/>Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.<br/>Endymion too, without a forest peer,<br/>Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,<br/>Among his brothers of the mountain chase.<br/>In midst of all, the venerable priest<br/>Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,<br/>And, after lifting up his aged hands,<br/>Thus spake he: "Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!<br/>Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:<br/>Whether descended from beneath the rocks<br/>That overtop your mountains; whether come<br/>From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;<br/>Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs<br/>Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze<br/>Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge<br/>Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,<br/>Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn<br/>By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:<br/>Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare<br/>The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;<br/>And all ye gentle girls who foster up<br/>Udderless lambs, and in a little cup<br/>Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:<br/>Yea, every one attend! for in good truth<br/>Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.<br/>Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than<br/>Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains<br/>Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains<br/>Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad<br/>Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had<br/>Great bounty from Endymion our lord.<br/>The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd<br/>His early song against yon breezy sky,<br/>That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."<br/><br/>  Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire<br/>Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;<br/>Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod<br/>With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.<br/>Now while the earth was drinking it, and while<br/>Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,<br/>And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright<br/>'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light<br/>Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:<br/><br/>  "O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang<br/>From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth<br/>Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death<br/>Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;<br/>Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress<br/>Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;<br/>And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken<br/>The dreary melody of bedded reeds--<br/>In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds<br/>The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;<br/>Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth<br/>Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx--do thou now,<br/>By thy love's milky brow!<br/>By all the trembling mazes that she ran,<br/>Hear us, great Pan!<br/><br/>  "O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles<br/>Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,<br/>What time thou wanderest at eventide<br/>Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side<br/>Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom<br/>Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom<br/>Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees<br/>Their golden honeycombs; our village leas<br/>Their fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;<br/>The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,<br/>To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries<br/>Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies<br/>Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year<br/>All its completions--be quickly near,<br/>By every wind that nods the mountain pine,<br/>O forester divine!<br/><br/>  "Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies<br/>For willing service; whether to surprise<br/>The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;<br/>Or upward ragged precipices flit<br/>To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;<br/>Or by mysterious enticement draw<br/>Bewildered shepherds to their path again;<br/>Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,<br/>And gather up all fancifullest shells<br/>For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,<br/>And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;<br/>Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,<br/>The while they pelt each other on the crown<br/>With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--<br/>By all the echoes that about thee ring,<br/>Hear us, O satyr king!<br/><br/>  "O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,<br/>While ever and anon to his shorn peers<br/>A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,<br/>When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn<br/>Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,<br/>To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:<br/>Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,<br/>That come a swooning over hollow grounds,<br/>And wither drearily on barren moors:<br/>Dread opener of the mysterious doors<br/>Leading to universal knowledge--see,<br/>Great son of Dryope,<br/>The many that are come to pay their vows<br/>With leaves about their brows!<br/><br/>  Be still the unimaginable lodge<br/>For solitary thinkings; such as dodge<br/>Conception to the very bourne of heaven,<br/>Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,<br/>That spreading in this dull and clodded earth<br/>Gives it a touch ethereal--a new birth:<br/>Be still a symbol of immensity;<br/>A firmament reflected in a sea;<br/>An element filling the space between;<br/>An unknown--but no more: we humbly screen<br/>With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,<br/>And giving out a shout most heaven rending,<br/>Conjure thee to receive our humble Paean,<br/>Upon thy Mount Lycean!<br/><br/>  Even while they brought the burden to a close,<br/>A shout from the whole multitude arose,<br/>That lingered in the air like dying rolls<br/>Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals<br/>Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.<br/>Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,<br/>Young companies nimbly began dancing<br/>To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.<br/>Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly<br/>To tunes forgotten--out of memory:<br/>Fair creatures! whose young children's children bred<br/>Thermopyl√¶ its heroes--not yet dead,<br/>But in old marbles ever beautiful.<br/>High genitors, unconscious did they cull<br/>Time's sweet first-fruits--they danc'd to weariness,<br/>And then in quiet circles did they press<br/>The hillock turf, and caught the latter end<br/>Of some strange history, potent to send<br/>A young mind from its bodily tenement.<br/>Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent<br/>On either side; pitying the sad death<br/>Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath<br/>Of Zephyr slew him,--Zephyr penitent,<br/>Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,<br/>Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.<br/>The archers too, upon a wider plain,<br/>Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,<br/>And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft<br/>Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,<br/>Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope<br/>Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee<br/>And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,<br/>Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young<br/>Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue<br/>Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,<br/>And very, very deadliness did nip<br/>Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood<br/>By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,<br/>Uplifting his strong bow into the air,<br/>Many might after brighter visions stare:<br/>After the Argonauts, in blind amaze<br/>Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,<br/>Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,<br/>There shot a golden splendour far and wide,<br/>Spangling those million poutings of the brine<br/>With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine<br/>From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;<br/>A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.<br/>Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,<br/>Might turn their steps towards the sober ring<br/>Where sat Endymion and the aged priest<br/>'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd<br/>The silvery setting of their mortal star.<br/>There they discours'd upon the fragile bar<br/>That keeps us from our homes ethereal;<br/>And what our duties there: to nightly call<br/>Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;<br/>To summon all the downiest clouds together<br/>For the sun's purple couch; to emulate<br/>In ministring the potent rule of fate<br/>With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;<br/>To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons<br/>Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,<br/>A world of other unguess'd offices.<br/>Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,<br/>Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse<br/>Each one his own anticipated bliss.<br/>One felt heart-certain that he could not miss<br/>His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,<br/>Where every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows<br/>Her lips with music for the welcoming.<br/>Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,<br/>To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,<br/>Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:<br/>Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,<br/>And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;<br/>And, ever after, through those regions be<br/>His messenger, his little Mercury.<br/>Some were athirst in soul to see again<br/>Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign<br/>In times long past; to sit with them, and talk<br/>Of all the chances in their earthly walk;<br/>Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores<br/>Of happiness, to when upon the moors,<br/>Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,<br/>And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told<br/>Their fond imaginations,--saving him<br/>Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,<br/>Endymion: yet hourly had he striven<br/>To hide the cankering venom, that had riven<br/>His fainting recollections. Now indeed<br/>His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed<br/>The sudden silence, or the whispers low,<br/>Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,<br/>Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,<br/>Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:<br/>But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,<br/>Like one who on the earth had never stept.<br/>Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,<br/>Frozen in that old tale Arabian.<br/><br/>  Who whispers him so pantingly and close?<br/>Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,<br/>His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,<br/>And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade<br/>A yielding up, a cradling on her care.<br/>Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:<br/>She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse<br/>Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,<br/>Along a path between two little streams,--<br/>Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,<br/>From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow<br/>From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;<br/>Until they came to where these streamlets fall,<br/>With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,<br/>Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush<br/>With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.<br/>A little shallop, floating there hard by,<br/>Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;<br/>And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,<br/>And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,--<br/>Peona guiding, through the water straight,<br/>Towards a bowery island opposite;<br/>Which gaining presently, she steered light<br/>Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,<br/>Where nested was an arbour, overwove<br/>By many a summer's silent fingering;<br/>To whose cool bosom she was used to bring<br/>Her playmates, with their needle broidery,<br/>And minstrel memories of times gone by.<br/><br/>  So she was gently glad to see him laid<br/>Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,<br/>On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,<br/>Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves<br/>When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,<br/>And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.<br/>Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:<br/>But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest<br/>Peona's busy hand against his lips,<br/>And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips<br/>In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps<br/>A patient watch over the stream that creeps<br/>Windingly by it, so the quiet maid<br/>Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade<br/>Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling<br/>Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling<br/>Among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.<br/><br/>  O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,<br/>That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind<br/>Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd<br/>Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key<br/>To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,<br/>Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,<br/>Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves<br/>And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world<br/>Of silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl'd<br/>Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,<br/>But renovates and lives?--Thus, in the bower,<br/>Endymion was calm'd to life again.<br/>Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,<br/>He said: "I feel this thine endearing love<br/>All through my bosom: thou art as a dove<br/>Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings<br/>About me; and the pearliest dew not brings<br/>Such morning incense from the fields of May,<br/>As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray<br/>From those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt<br/>Of sisterly affection. Can I want<br/>Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?<br/>Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears<br/>That, any longer, I will pass my days<br/>Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise<br/>My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more<br/>Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:<br/>Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll<br/>Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll<br/>The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:<br/>And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,<br/>Again I'll linger in a sloping mead<br/>To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed<br/>Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,<br/>And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat<br/>My soul to keep in its resolved course."<br/><br/>  Hereat Peona, in their silver source,<br/>Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,<br/>And took a lute, from which there pulsing came<br/>A lively prelude, fashioning the way<br/>In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay<br/>More subtle cadenced, more forest wild<br/>Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;<br/>And nothing since has floated in the air<br/>So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare<br/>Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;<br/>For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd<br/>The quick invisible strings, even though she saw<br/>Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw<br/>Before the deep intoxication.<br/>But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon<br/>Her self-possession--swung the lute aside,<br/>And earnestly said: "Brother, 'tis vain to hide<br/>That thou dost know of things mysterious,<br/>Immortal, starry; such alone could thus<br/>Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught<br/>Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught<br/>A Paphian dove upon a message sent?<br/>Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,<br/>Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen<br/>Her naked limbs among the alders green;<br/>And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace<br/>Something more high perplexing in thy face!"<br/><br/>  Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,<br/>And said, "Art thou so pale, who wast so bland<br/>And merry in our meadows? How is this?<br/>Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!--<br/>Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change<br/>Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?<br/>Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?<br/>Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,<br/>That toiling years would put within my grasp,<br/>That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp<br/>No man e'er panted for a mortal love.<br/>So all have set my heavier grief above<br/>These things which happen. Rightly have they done:<br/>I, who still saw the horizontal sun<br/>Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,<br/>Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd<br/>My spear aloft, as signal for the chace--<br/>I, who, for very sport of heart, would race<br/>With my own steed from Araby; pluck down<br/>A vulture from his towery perching; frown<br/>A lion into growling, loth retire--<br/>To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,<br/>And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast<br/>Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.<br/><br/>  "This river does not see the naked sky,<br/>Till it begins to progress silverly<br/>Around the western border of the wood,<br/>Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood<br/>Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:<br/>And in that nook, the very pride of June,<br/>Had I been used to pass my weary eves;<br/>The rather for the sun unwilling leaves<br/>So dear a picture of his sovereign power,<br/>And I could witness his most kingly hour,<br/>When he doth lighten up the golden reins,<br/>And paces leisurely down amber plains<br/>His snorting four. Now when his chariot last<br/>Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,<br/>There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed<br/>Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:<br/>At which I wondered greatly, knowing well<br/>That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;<br/>And, sitting down close by, began to muse<br/>What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,<br/>In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;<br/>Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook<br/>Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,<br/>Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth<br/>Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,<br/>Until my head was dizzy and distraught.<br/>Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole<br/>A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;<br/>And shaping visions all about my sight<br/>Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;<br/>The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,<br/>And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:<br/>And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell<br/>The enchantment that afterwards befel?<br/>Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream<br/>That never tongue, although it overteem<br/>With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,<br/>Could figure out and to conception bring<br/>All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay<br/>Watching the zenith, where the milky way<br/>Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;<br/>And travelling my eye, until the doors<br/>Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,<br/>I became loth and fearful to alight<br/>From such high soaring by a downward glance:<br/>So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,<br/>Spreading imaginary pinions wide.<br/>When, presently, the stars began to glide,<br/>And faint away, before my eager view:<br/>At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,<br/>And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;<br/>And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge<br/>The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er<br/>A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar<br/>So passionately bright, my dazzled soul<br/>Commingling with her argent spheres did roll<br/>Through clear and cloudy, even when she went<br/>At last into a dark and vapoury tent--<br/>Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train<br/>Of planets all were in the blue again.<br/>To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd<br/>My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed<br/>By a bright something, sailing down apace,<br/>Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:<br/>Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,<br/>Who from Olympus watch our destinies!<br/>Whence that completed form of all completeness?<br/>Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?<br/>Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where<br/>Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?<br/>Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;<br/>Not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun<br/>Such follying before thee--yet she had,<br/>Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;<br/>And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,<br/>Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,<br/>Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;<br/>The which were blended in, I know not how,<br/>With such a paradise of lips and eyes,<br/>Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,<br/>That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings<br/>And plays about its fancy, till the stings<br/>Of human neighbourhood envenom all.<br/>Unto what awful power shall I call?<br/>To what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet,<br/>More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet<br/>Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose<br/>From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows<br/>Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;<br/>'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million<br/>Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,<br/>Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,<br/>Handfuls of daisies."--"Endymion, how strange!<br/>Dream within dream!"--"She took an airy range,<br/>And then, towards me, like a very maid,<br/>Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,<br/>And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;<br/>Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,<br/>Yet held my recollection, even as one<br/>Who dives three fathoms where the waters run<br/>Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,<br/>I felt upmounted in that region<br/>Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,<br/>And eagles struggle with the buffeting north<br/>That balances the heavy meteor-stone;--<br/>Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,<br/>But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.<br/>Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,<br/>And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;<br/>Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd<br/>Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:<br/>There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd<br/>To faint once more by looking on my bliss--<br/>I was distracted; madly did I kiss<br/>The wooing arms which held me, and did give<br/>My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,<br/>To take in draughts of life from the gold fount<br/>Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count<br/>The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd<br/>A second self, that each might be redeem'd<br/>And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.<br/>Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press<br/>Her very cheek against my crowned lip,<br/>And, at that moment, felt my body dip<br/>Into a warmer air: a moment more,<br/>Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store<br/>Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes<br/>A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,<br/>Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,<br/>Made delicate from all white-flower bells;<br/>And once, above the edges of our nest,<br/>An arch face peep'd,--an Oread as I guess'd.<br/><br/>  "Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me<br/>In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,<br/>Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,<br/>And stare them from me? But no, like a spark<br/>That needs must die, although its little beam<br/>Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream<br/>Fell into nothing--into stupid sleep.<br/>And so it was, until a gentle creep,<br/>A careful moving caught my waking ears,<br/>And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,<br/>My clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung<br/>Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung<br/>A heavy ditty, and the sullen day<br/>Had chidden herald Hesperus away,<br/>With leaden looks: the solitary breeze<br/>Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze<br/>With wayward melancholy; and r thought,<br/>Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought<br/>Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--<br/>Away I wander'd--all the pleasant hues<br/>Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades<br/>Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades<br/>Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills<br/>Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills<br/>Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown<br/>In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown<br/>Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird<br/>Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd<br/>In little journeys, I beheld in it<br/>A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit<br/>My soul with under darkness; to entice<br/>My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:<br/>Therefore I eager followed, and did curse<br/>The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,<br/>Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!<br/>These things, with all their comfortings, are given<br/>To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,<br/>Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea<br/>Of weary life."<br/><br/>                  Thus ended he, and both<br/>Sat silent: for the maid was very loth<br/>To answer; feeling well that breathed words<br/>Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords<br/>Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps<br/>Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,<br/>And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;<br/>To put on such a look as would say, Shame<br/>On this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,<br/>She could as soon have crush'd away the life<br/>From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,<br/>She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?<br/>This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!<br/>That one who through this middle earth should pass<br/>Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave<br/>His name upon the harp-string, should achieve<br/>No higher bard than simple maidenhood,<br/>Singing alone, and fearfully,--how the blood<br/>Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray<br/>He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,<br/>If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;<br/>What could it be but love? How a ring-dove<br/>Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;<br/>And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,<br/>The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;<br/>And then the ballad of his sad life closes<br/>With sighs, and an alas!--Endymion!<br/>Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,--anon<br/>Among the winds at large--that all may hearken!<br/>Although, before the crystal heavens darken,<br/>I watch and dote upon the silver lakes<br/>Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes<br/>The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,<br/>Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands<br/>With horses prancing o'er them, palaces<br/>And towers of amethyst,--would I so tease<br/>My pleasant days, because I could not mount<br/>Into those regions? The Morphean fount<br/>Of that fine element that visions, dreams,<br/>And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams<br/>Into its airy channels with so subtle,<br/>So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,<br/>Circled a million times within the space<br/>Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,<br/>A tinting of its quality: how light<br/>Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight<br/>Than the mere nothing that engenders them!<br/>Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem<br/>Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?<br/>Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick<br/>For nothing but a dream?" Hereat the youth<br/>Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth<br/>Was in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids<br/>Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids<br/>A little breeze to creep between the fans<br/>Of careless butterflies: amid his pains<br/>He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,<br/>Full palatable; and a colour grew<br/>Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.<br/><br/>  "Peona! ever have I long'd to slake<br/>My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,<br/>No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace<br/>The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd--<br/>Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd<br/>And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope<br/>Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,<br/>To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.<br/>Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks<br/>Our ready minds to fellowship divine,<br/>A fellowship with essence; till we shine,<br/>Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold<br/>The clear religion of heaven! Fold<br/>A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,<br/>And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress<br/>Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,<br/>And with a sympathetic touch unbinds<br/>Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:<br/>Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;<br/>Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;<br/>Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave<br/>Round every spot where trod Apollo's foot;<br/>Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,<br/>Where long ago a giant battle was;<br/>And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass<br/>In every place where infant Orpheus slept.<br/>Feel we these things?--that moment have we stept<br/>Into a sort of oneness, and our state<br/>Is like a floating spirit's. But there are<br/>Richer entanglements, enthralments far<br/>More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,<br/>To the chief intensity: the crown of these<br/>Is made of love and friendship, and sits high<br/>Upon the forehead of humanity.<br/>All its more ponderous and bulky worth<br/>Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth<br/>A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,<br/>There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop<br/>Of light, and that is love: its influence,<br/>Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,<br/>At which we start and fret; till in the end,<br/>Melting into its radiance, we blend,<br/>Mingle, and so become a part of it,--<br/>Nor with aught else can our souls interknit<br/>So wingedly: when we combine therewith,<br/>Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,<br/>And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.<br/>Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,<br/>That men, who might have tower'd in the van<br/>Of all the congregated world, to fan<br/>And winnow from the coming step of time<br/>All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime<br/>Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,<br/>Have been content to let occasion die,<br/>Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.<br/>And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,<br/>Than speak against this ardent listlessness:<br/>For I have ever thought that it might bless<br/>The world with benefits unknowingly;<br/>As does the nightingale, upperched high,<br/>And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves--<br/>She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives<br/>How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.<br/>Just so may love, although 'tis understood<br/>The mere commingling of passionate breath,<br/>Produce more than our searching witnesseth:<br/>What I know not: but who, of men, can tell<br/>That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell<br/>To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,<br/>The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,<br/>The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,<br/>The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,<br/>Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,<br/>If human souls did never kiss and greet?<br/><br/>  "Now, if this earthly love has power to make<br/>Men's being mortal, immortal; to shake<br/>Ambition from their memories, and brim<br/>Their measure of content; what merest whim,<br/>Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,<br/>To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim<br/>A love immortal, an immortal too.<br/>Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,<br/>And never can be born of atomies<br/>That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,<br/>Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,<br/>My restless spirit never could endure<br/>To brood so long upon one luxury,<br/>Unless it did, though fearfully, espy<br/>A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.<br/>My sayings will the less obscured seem,<br/>When I have told thee how my waking sight<br/>Has made me scruple whether that same night<br/>Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!<br/>Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,<br/>Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,<br/>Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows<br/>Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,<br/>And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,<br/>And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide<br/>Past them, but he must brush on every side.<br/>Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,<br/>Far as the slabbed margin of a well,<br/>Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye<br/>Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.<br/>Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set<br/>Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet<br/>Edges them round, and they have golden pits:<br/>'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits<br/>In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,<br/>When all above was faint with mid-day heat.<br/>And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,<br/>I'd bubble up the water through a reed;<br/>So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships<br/>Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,<br/>With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be<br/>Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,<br/>When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,<br/>I sat contemplating the figures wild<br/>Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.<br/>Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew<br/>A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;<br/>So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver<br/>The happy chance: so happy, I was fain<br/>To follow it upon the open plain,<br/>And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!<br/>A wonder, fair as any I have told--<br/>The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,<br/>Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap<br/>Through the cool depth.--It moved as if to flee--<br/>I started up, when lo! refreshfully,<br/>There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,<br/>Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,<br/>Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,<br/>Bathing my spirit in a new delight.<br/>Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss<br/>Alone preserved me from the drear abyss<br/>Of death, for the fair form had gone again.<br/>Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain<br/>Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth<br/>On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,<br/>'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.<br/>How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure<br/>Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,<br/>By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!<br/>Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,<br/>Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:<br/>And a whole age of lingering moments crept<br/>Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept<br/>Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.<br/>Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;<br/>Once more been tortured with renewed life.<br/>When last the wintry gusts gave over strife<br/>With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies<br/>Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes<br/>In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,--<br/>That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,<br/>My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,<br/>Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd<br/>All torment from my breast;--'twas even then,<br/>Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den<br/>Of helpless discontent,--hurling my lance<br/>From place to place, and following at chance,<br/>At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,<br/>And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck<br/>In the middle of a brook,--whose silver ramble<br/>Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,<br/>Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,<br/>Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave<br/>The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,--<br/>'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock<br/>Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,<br/>Hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread<br/>Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.<br/>"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?"<br/>Said I, low voic'd: "Ah whither! 'Tis the grot<br/>Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,<br/>Doth her resign; and where her tender hands<br/>She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:<br/>Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,<br/>And babbles thorough silence, till her wits<br/>Are gone in tender madness, and anon,<br/>Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone<br/>Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,<br/>And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,<br/>To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,<br/>Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,<br/>And weave them dyingly--send honey-whispers<br/>Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers<br/>May sigh my love unto her pitying!<br/>O charitable echo! hear, and sing<br/>This ditty to her!--tell her"--so I stay'd<br/>My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,<br/>Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,<br/>And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.<br/>Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name<br/>Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:<br/>‚ÄòEndymion! the cave is secreter<br/>Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir<br/>No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise<br/>Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys<br/>And trembles through my labyrinthine hair."<br/>At that oppress'd I hurried in.--Ah! where<br/>Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?<br/>I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed<br/>Sorrow the way to death, but patiently<br/>Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;<br/>And come instead demurest meditation,<br/>To occupy me wholly, and to fashion<br/>My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.<br/>No more will I count over, link by link,<br/>My chain of grief: no longer strive to find<br/>A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind<br/>Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,<br/>Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;<br/>What a calm round of hours shall make my days.<br/>There is a paly flame of hope that plays<br/>Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught--<br/>And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,<br/>Already, a more healthy countenance?<br/>By this the sun is setting; we may chance<br/>Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."<br/><br/>  This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star<br/>Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:<br/>They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.
