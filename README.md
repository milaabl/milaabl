<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    When some proud son of man returns to earth,<br/>Unknown to glory, but upheld by birth,<br/>The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe<br/>And storied urns record who rest below:<br/>When all is done, upon the tomb is seen,<br/>Not what he was, but what he should have been:<br/>But the poor dog, in life the firmest friend,<br/>The first to welcome, foremost to defend,<br/>Whose honest heart is still his master's own,<br/>Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,<br/>Unhonour'd falls, unnoticed all his worth--<br/>Denied in heaven the soul he held on earth:<br/>While Man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,<br/>And claims himself a sole exclusive Heaven.<br/>Oh Man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,<br/>Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power,<br/>Who knows thee well must quit thee with disgust,<br/>Degraded mass of animated dust!<br/>Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,<br/>Thy smiles hypocrisy, thy words deceit!<br/>By nature vile, ennobled but by name,<br/>Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.<br/>Ye! who perchance behold this simple urn,<br/>Pass on--it honours none you wish to mourn:<br/>To mark a Friend's remains these stones arise;<br/>I never knew but one,--and here he lies.
</p>
