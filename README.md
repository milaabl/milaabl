# üíÆ The Bride of Abydos. a Turkish Tale by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
                   "Had we never loved sae kindly,<br/>                Had we never loved sae blindly,<br/>                Never met--or never parted,<br/>                We had ne'er been broken-hearted."--<br/><br/>        Burns .<br/><br/>CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle<br/>  Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?<br/>Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,<br/>  Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?<br/>Know ye the land of the cedar and vine,<br/>Where the flowers ever blossom, the beams ever shine;<br/>Where the light wings of Zephyr, oppressed with perfume,<br/>Wax faint o'er the gardens of G√∫l in her bloom;<br/>Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit,<br/>And the voice of the nightingale never is mute;<br/>Where the tints of the earth, and the hues of the sky,<br/>In colour though varied, in beauty may vie,<br/>And the purple of Ocean is deepest in dye;<br/>Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine,<br/>And all, save the spirit of man, is divine--<br/>Tis the clime of the East--'tis the land of the Sun--<br/>Can he smile on such deeds as his children have done?<br/>Oh! wild as the accents of lovers' farewell<br/>Are the hearts which they bear, and the tales which they tell.<br/><br/>    Begirt with many a gallant slave,<br/>    Apparelled as becomes the brave,<br/>    Awaiting each his Lord's behest<br/>    To guide his steps, or guard his rest,<br/>    Old Giaffir sate in his Divan:<br/>      Deep thought was in his ag√©d eye;<br/>    And though the face of Mussulman<br/>      Not oft betrays to standers by<br/>  The mind within, well skilled to hide<br/>  All but unconquerable pride,<br/>  His pensive cheek and pondering brow<br/>  Did more than he was wont avow.<br/><br/>"Let the chamber be cleared."--The train disappeared--<br/>  "Now call me the chief of the Haram guard"--<br/>With Giaffir is none but his only son,<br/>  And the Nubian awaiting the sire's award.<br/>  "Haroun--when all the crowd that wait<br/>  Are passed beyond the outer gate,<br/>  (Woe to the head whose eye beheld<br/>  My child Zuleika's face unveiled!)<br/>  Hence, lead my daughter from her tower--<br/>  Her fate is fixed this very hour;<br/>  Yet not to her repeat my thought--<br/>  By me alone be duty taught!"<br/><br/>  "Pacha! to hear is to obey."--<br/>  No more must slave to despot say--<br/>  Then to the tower had ta'en his way:<br/>  But here young Selim silence brake,<br/>    First lowly rendering reverence meet;<br/>  And downcast looked, and gently spake,<br/>    Still standing at the Pacha's feet:<br/>  For son of Moslem must expire,<br/>  Ere dare to sit before his sire!<br/>  "Father! for fear that thou shouldst chide<br/>  My sister, or her sable guide--<br/>  Know--for the fault, if fault there be,<br/>  Was mine--then fall thy frowns on me!<br/>  So lovelily the morning shone,<br/>    That--let the old and weary sleep--<br/>  I could not; and to view alone<br/>    The fairest scenes of land and deep,<br/>  With none to listen and reply<br/>  To thoughts with which my heart beat high<br/>  Were irksome--for whate'er my mood,<br/>  In sooth I love not solitude;<br/>  I on Zuleika's slumber broke,<br/>    And, as thou knowest that for me<br/>    Soon turns the Haram's grating key,<br/>  Before the guardian slaves awoke<br/>  We to the cypress groves had flown,<br/>  And made earth, main, and heaven our own!<br/>  There lingered we, beguiled too long<br/>  With Mejnoun's tale, or Sadi's song;<br/>  Till I, who heard the deep tambour<br/>  Beat thy Divan's approaching hour,<br/>  To thee, and to my duty true,<br/>  Warned by the sound, to greet thee flew:<br/>  But there Zuleika wanders yet--<br/>  Nay, Father, rage not--nor forget<br/>  That none can pierce that secret bower<br/>  But those who watch the women's tower."<br/><br/>"Son of a slave"--the Pacha said--<br/>"From unbelieving mother bred,<br/>Vain were a father's hope to see<br/>Aught that beseems a man in thee.<br/>Thou, when thine arm should bend the bow,<br/>  And hurl the dart, and curb the steed,<br/>  Thou, Greek in soul if not in creed,<br/>Must pore where babbling waters flow,<br/>And watch unfolding roses blow.<br/>Would that yon Orb, whose matin glow<br/>Thy listless eyes so much admire,<br/>Would lend thee something of his fire!<br/>Thou, who woulds't see this battlement<br/>By Christian cannon piecemeal rent;<br/>Nay, tamely view old Stambol's wall<br/>Before the dogs of Moscow fall,<br/>Nor strike one stroke for life and death<br/>Against the curs of Nazareth!<br/>Go--let thy less than woman's hand<br/>Assume the distaff--not the brand.<br/>But, Haroun!--to my daughter speed:<br/>And hark--of thine own head take heed--<br/>If thus Zuleika oft takes wing--<br/>Thou see'st yon bow--it hath a string!"<br/><br/>No sound from Selim's lip was heard,<br/>  At least that met old Giaffir's ear,<br/>But every frown and every word<br/>Pierced keener than a Christian's sword.<br/>  "Son of a slave!--reproached with fear!<br/>  Those gibes had cost another dear.<br/>Son of a slave!--and _who_ my Sire?"<br/>  Thus held his thoughts their dark career;<br/>And glances ev'n of more than ire<br/>  Flash forth, then faintly disappear.<br/>Old Giaffir gazed upon his son<br/>  And started; for within his eye<br/>He read how much his wrath had done;<br/>He saw rebellion there begun:<br/>  "Come hither, boy--what, no reply?<br/>I mark thee--and I know thee too;<br/>But there be deeds thou dar'st not do:<br/>But if thy beard had manlier length,<br/>And if thy hand had skill and strength,<br/>I'd joy to see thee break a lance,<br/>Albeit against my own perchance."<br/>As sneeringly these accents fell,<br/>On Selim's eye he fiercely gazed:<br/>  That eye returned him glance for glance,<br/>And proudly to his Sire's was raised,<br/>  Till Giaffir's quailed and shrunk askance--<br/>And why--he felt, but durst not tell.<br/>"Much I misdoubt this wayward boy<br/>Will one day work me more annoy:<br/>I never loved him from his birth,<br/>And--but his arm is little worth,<br/>And scarcely in the chase could cope<br/>With timid fawn or antelope,<br/>Far less would venture into strife<br/>Where man contends for fame and life--<br/>  I would not trust that look or tone:<br/>No--nor the blood so near my own.<br/>That blood--he hath not heard--no more--<br/>I'll watch him closer than before.<br/>He is an Arab to my sight,<br/>Or Christian crouching in the fight--<br/>But hark!--I hear Zuleika's voice;<br/>  Like Houris' hymn it meets mine ear:<br/>She is the offspring of my choice;<br/>  Oh! more than ev'n her mother dear,<br/>With all to hope, and nought to fear--<br/>My Peri! ever welcome here!<br/>Sweet, as the desert fountain's wave<br/>To lips just cooled in time to save--<br/>  Such to my longing sight art thou;<br/>Nor can they waft to Mecca's shrine<br/>More thanks for life, than I for thine,<br/>  Who blest thy birth and bless thee now."<br/><br/>Fair, as the first that fell of womankind,<br/>  When on that dread yet lovely serpent smiling,<br/>Whose Image then was stamped upon her mind--<br/>  But once beguiled--and ever more beguiling;<br/>Dazzling, as that, oh! too transcendent vision<br/>  To Sorrow's phantom-peopled slumber given,<br/>When heart meets heart again in dreams Elysian,<br/>  And paints the lost on Earth revived in Heaven;<br/>Soft, as the memory of buried love;<br/>Pure, as the prayer which Childhood wafts above;<br/>Was she--the daughter of that rude old Chief,<br/>Who met the maid with tears--but not of grief.<br/><br/>Who hath not proved how feebly words essay<br/>To fix one spark of Beauty's heavenly ray?<br/>Who doth not feel, until his failing sight<br/>Faints into dimness with its own delight,<br/>His changing cheek, his sinking heart confess<br/>The might--the majesty of Loveliness?<br/>Such was Zuleika--such around her shone<br/>The nameless charms unmarked by her alone--<br/>The light of Love, the purity of Grace,<br/>The mind, the Music breathing from her face,<br/>The heart whose softness harmonized the whole,<br/>And oh! that eye was in itself a Soul!<br/><br/>Her graceful arms in meekness bending<br/>  Across her gently-budding breast;<br/>At one kind word those arms extending<br/>  To clasp the neck of him who blest<br/>  His child caressing and carest,<br/>  Zuleika came--and Giaffir felt<br/>  His purpose half within him melt:<br/>  Not that against her fancied weal<br/>  His heart though stern could ever feel;<br/>  Affection chained her to that heart;<br/>  Ambition tore the links apart.<br/><br/>"Zuleika! child of Gentleness!<br/>  How dear this very day must tell,<br/>When I forget my own distress,<br/>  In losing what I love so well,<br/>To bid thee with another dwell:<br/>Another! and a braver man<br/>Was never seen in battle's van.<br/>We Moslem reck not much of blood:<br/>  But yet the line of Carasman<br/>Unchanged, unchangeable hath stood<br/>  First of the bold Timariot bands<br/>That won and well can keep their lands.<br/>Enough that he who comes to woo<br/>Is kinsman of the Bey Oglou:<br/>His years need scarce a thought employ;<br/>I would not have thee wed a boy.<br/>And thou shalt have a noble dower:<br/>And his and my united power<br/>Will laugh to scorn the death-firman,<br/>Which others tremble but to scan,<br/>And teach the messenger what fate<br/>The bearer of such boon may wait.<br/>And now thou know'st thy father's will;<br/>  All that thy sex hath need to know:<br/>'Twas mine to teach obedience still--<br/>  The way to love, thy Lord may show."<br/><br/>  In silence bowed the virgin's head;<br/>    And if her eye was filled with tears<br/>  That stifled feeling dare not shed,<br/>  And changed her cheek from pale to red,<br/>    And red to pale, as through her ears<br/>  Those wing√©d words like arrows sped,<br/>    What could such be but maiden fears?<br/>  So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,<br/>  Love half regrets to kiss it dry;<br/>  So sweet the blush of Bashfulness,<br/>  Even Pity scarce can wish it less!<br/><br/>  Whate'er it was the sire forgot:<br/>  Or if remembered, marked it not;<br/>  Thrice clapped his hands, and called his steed,<br/>    Resigned his gem-adorned chibouque,<br/>  And mounting featly for the mead,<br/>    With Maugrabeel and Mamaluke,<br/>    His way amid his Delis took,<br/>  To witness many an active deed<br/>  With sabre keen, or blunt jerreed.<br/>  The Kislar only and his Moors<br/>  Watch well the Haram's massy doors.<br/><br/>His head was leant upon his hand,<br/>  His eye looked o'er the dark blue water<br/>That swiftly glides and gently swells<br/>Between the winding Dardanelles;<br/>But yet he saw nor sea nor strand,<br/>Nor even his Pacha's turbaned band<br/>  Mix in the game of mimic slaughter,<br/>Careering cleave the folded felt<br/>With sabre stroke right sharply dealt;<br/>Nor marked the javelin-darting crowd,<br/>Nor heard their Ollahs wild and loud--<br/>  He thought but of old Giaffir's daughter!<br/><br/>No word from Selim's bosom broke;<br/>One sigh Zuleika's thought bespoke:<br/>Still gazed he through the lattice grate,<br/>Pale, mute, and mournfully sedate.<br/>To him Zuleika's eye was turned,<br/>But little from his aspect learned:<br/>Equal her grief, yet not the same;<br/>Her heart confessed a gentler flame:<br/>But yet that heart, alarmed or weak,<br/>She knew not why, forbade to speak.<br/>Yet speak she must--but when essay?<br/>"How strange he thus should turn away!<br/>Not thus we e'er before have met;<br/>Not thus shall be our parting yet."<br/>Thrice paced she slowly through the room,<br/>  And watched his eye--it still was fixed:<br/>  She snatched the urn wherein was mixed<br/>The Persian Atar-gul's perfume,<br/>And sprinkled all its odours o'er<br/>The pictured roof and marble floor:<br/>The drops, that through his glittering vest<br/>The playful girl's appeal addressed,<br/>Unheeded o'er his bosom flew,<br/>As if that breast were marble too.<br/>"What, sullen yet? it must not be--<br/>Oh! gentle Selim, this from thee!"<br/>She saw in curious order set<br/>  The fairest flowers of Eastern land--<br/>"He loved them once; may touch them yet,<br/>  If offered by Zuleika's hand."<br/>The childish thought was hardly breathed<br/>Before the rose was plucked and wreathed;<br/>The next fond moment saw her seat<br/>Her fairy form at Selim's feet:<br/>"This rose to calm my brother's cares<br/>A message from the Bulbul bears;<br/>It says to-night he will prolong<br/>For Selim's ear his sweetest song;<br/>And though his note is somewhat sad,<br/>He'll try for once a strain more glad,<br/>With some faint hope his altered lay<br/>May sing these gloomy thoughts away.<br/><br/>  "What! not receive my foolish flower?<br/>    Nay then I am indeed unblest:<br/>  On me can thus thy forehead lower?<br/>    And know'st thou not who loves thee best?<br/>  Oh, Selim dear! oh, more than dearest!<br/>  Say, is it me thou hat'st or fearest?<br/>  Come, lay thy head upon my breast,<br/>  And I will kiss thee into rest,<br/>  Since words of mine, and songs must fail,<br/>  Ev'n from my fabled nightingale.<br/>  I knew our sire at times was stern,<br/>  But this from thee had yet to learn:<br/>  Too well I know he loves thee not;<br/>  But is Zuleika's love forgot?<br/>  Ah! deem I right? the Pacha's plan--<br/>  This kinsman Bey of Carasman<br/>  Perhaps may prove some foe of thine.<br/>  If so, I swear by Mecca's shrine,--<br/>  If shrines that ne'er approach allow<br/>  To woman's step admit her vow,--<br/>  Without thy free consent--command--<br/>  The Sultan should not have my hand!<br/>  Think'st thou that I could bear to part<br/>  With thee, and learn to halve my heart?<br/>  Ah! were I severed from thy side,<br/>  Where were thy friend--and who my guide?<br/>  Years have not seen, Time shall not see,<br/>  The hour that tears my soul from thee:<br/>  Ev'n Azrael, from his deadly quiver<br/>    When flies that shaft, and fly it must,<br/>  That parts all else, shall doom for ever<br/>    Our hearts to undivided dust!"<br/><br/>He lived--he breathed--he moved--he felt;<br/>He raised the maid from where she knelt;<br/>His trance was gone, his keen eye shone<br/>With thoughts that long in darkness dwelt;<br/>With thoughts that burn--in rays that melt.<br/>As the stream late concealed<br/>  By the fringe of its willows,<br/>When it rushes reveal'd<br/>  In the light of its billows;<br/>As the bolt bursts on high<br/>  From the black cloud that bound it,<br/>Flashed the soul of that eye<br/>  Through the long lashes round it.<br/>A war-horse at the trumpet's sound,<br/>A lion roused by heedless hound,<br/>A tyrant waked to sudden strife<br/>By graze of ill-directed knife,<br/>Starts not to more convulsive life<br/>Than he, who heard that vow, displayed,<br/>And all, before repressed, betrayed:<br/>"Now thou art mine, for ever mine,<br/>With life to keep, and scarce with life resign;<br/>Now thou art mine, that sacred oath,<br/>Though sworn by one, hath bound us both.<br/>Yes, fondly, wisely hast thou done;<br/>That vow hath saved more heads than one:<br/>But blench not thou--thy simplest tress<br/>Claims more from me than tenderness;<br/>I would not wrong the slenderest hair<br/>That clusters round thy forehead fair,<br/>For all the treasures buried far<br/>Within the caves of Istakar.<br/>This morning clouds upon me lowered,<br/>Reproaches on my head were showered,<br/>And Giaffir almost called me coward!<br/>Now I have motive to be brave;<br/>The son of his neglected slave,<br/>Nay, start not,'twas the term he gave,<br/>May show, though little apt to vaunt,<br/>A heart his words nor deeds can daunt.<br/>_His_ son, indeed!--yet, thanks to thee,<br/>Perchance I am, at least shall be;<br/>But let our plighted secret vow<br/>Be only known to us as now.<br/>I know the wretch who dares demand<br/>From Giaffir thy reluctant hand;<br/>More ill-got wealth, a meaner soul<br/>Holds not a Musselim's control;<br/>Was he not bred in Egripo?<br/>A viler race let Israel show!<br/>But let that pass--to none be told<br/>Our oath; the rest shall time unfold.<br/>To me and mine leave Osman Bey!<br/>I've partisans for Peril's day:<br/>Think not I am what I appear;<br/>I've arms--and friends--and vengeance near."<br/><br/>"Think not thou art what thou appearest!<br/>  My Selim, thou art sadly changed:<br/>This morn I saw thee gentlest--dearest--<br/>  But now thou'rt from thyself estranged.<br/>My love thou surely knew'st before,<br/>It ne'er was less--nor can be more.<br/>To see thee--hear thee--near thee stay--<br/>  And hate the night--I know not why,<br/>Save that we meet not but by day;<br/>  With thee to live, with thee to die,<br/>  I dare not to my hope deny:<br/>Thy cheek--thine eyes--thy lips to kiss--<br/>Like this--and this--no more than this;<br/>For, Allah! sure thy lips are flame:<br/>  What fever in thy veins is flushing?<br/>My own have nearly caught the same,<br/>  At least I feel my cheek, too, blushing.<br/>To soothe thy sickness, watch thy health,<br/>Partake, but never waste thy wealth,<br/>Or stand with smiles unmurmuring by,<br/>And lighten half thy poverty;<br/>Do all but close thy dying eye,<br/>For that I could not live to try;<br/>To these alone my thoughts aspire:<br/>More can I do? or thou require?<br/>But, Selim, thou must answer why<br/>We need so much of mystery?<br/>The cause I cannot dream nor tell,<br/>But be it, since thou say'st 'tis well;<br/>Yet what thou mean'st by 'arms' and 'friends,'<br/>Beyond my weaker sense extends.<br/>I meant that Giaffir should have heard<br/>  The very vow I plighted thee;<br/>His wrath would not revoke my word:<br/>  But surely he would leave me free.<br/>  Can this fond wish seem strange in me,<br/>To be what I have ever been?<br/>What other hath Zuleika seen<br/>From simple childhood's earliest hour?<br/>  What other can she seek to see<br/>Than thee, companion of her bower,<br/>  The partner of her infancy?<br/>These cherished thoughts with life begun,<br/>  Say, why must I no more avow?<br/>What change is wrought to make me shun<br/>  The truth--my pride, and thine till now?<br/>To meet the gaze of stranger's eyes<br/>Our law--our creed--our God denies;<br/>Nor shall one wandering thought of mine<br/>At such, our Prophet's will, repine:<br/>No! happier made by that decree,<br/>He left me all in leaving thee.<br/>Deep were my anguish, thus compelled<br/>To wed with one I ne'er beheld:<br/>This wherefore should I not reveal?<br/>Why wilt thou urge me to conceal?<br/>I know the Pacha's haughty mood<br/>To thee hath never boded good;<br/>And he so often storms at nought,<br/>Allah! forbid that e'er he ought!<br/>And why I know not, but within<br/>My heart concealment weighs like sin.<br/>If then such secrecy be crime,<br/>  And such it feels while lurking here;<br/>Oh, Selim! tell me yet in time,<br/>  Nor leave me thus to thoughts of fear.<br/>Ah! yonder see the Tchocadar,<br/>My father leaves the mimic war;<br/>I tremble now to meet his eye--<br/>Say, Selim, canst thou tell me why?"<br/><br/>"Zuleika--to thy tower's retreat<br/>Betake thee--Giaffir I can greet:<br/>And now with him I fain must prate<br/>Of firmans, imposts, levies, state.<br/>There's fearful news from Danube's banks,<br/>Our Vizier nobly thins his ranks<br/>For which the Giaour may give him thanks!<br/>Our Sultan hath a shorter way<br/>Such costly triumph to repay.<br/>But, mark me, when the twilight drum<br/>  Hath warned the troops to food and sleep,<br/>Unto thy cell with Selim come;<br/>  Then softly from the Haram creep<br/>  Where we may wander by the deep:<br/>  Our garden battlements are steep;<br/>Nor these will rash intruder climb<br/>To list our words, or stint our time;<br/>And if he doth, I want not steel<br/>Which some have felt, and more may feel.<br/>Then shalt thou learn of Selim more<br/>Than thou hast heard or thought before:<br/>Trust me, Zuleika--fear not me!<br/>Thou know'st I hold a Haram key."<br/><br/>"Fear thee, my Selim! ne'er till now<br/>Did words like this----"<br/><br/>    "Delay not thou;<br/>I keep the key--and Haroun's guard<br/>Have _some_, and hope of _more_ reward.<br/>To-night, Zuleika, thou shalt hear<br/>My tale, my purpose, and my fear:<br/>I am not, love! what I appear."<br/><br/>CANTO THE SECOND.<br/><br/>The winds are high on Helle's wave,<br/>  As on that night of stormy water<br/>When Love, who sent, forgot to save<br/>The young--the beautiful--the brave--<br/>  The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.<br/>Oh!

to the hurried question of Despair:<br/>"Where is my child?"--an Echo answers--"Where?"<br/><br/>Within the place of thousand tombs<br/>  That shine beneath, while dark above<br/>The sad but living cypress glooms<br/>  And withers not, though branch and leaf<br/>Are stamped with an eternal grief,<br/>  Like early unrequited Love,<br/>One spot exists, which ever blooms,<br/>  Ev'n in that deadly grove--<br/>A single rose is shedding there<br/>  Its lonely lustre, meek and pale:<br/>It looks as planted by Despair--<br/>  So white--so faint--the slightest gale<br/>Might whirl the leaves on high;<br/>  And yet, though storms and blight assail,<br/>And hands more rude than wintry sky<br/>  May wring it from the stem--in vain--<br/>  To-morrow sees it bloom again!<br/>The stalk some Spirit gently rears,<br/>And waters with celestial tears;<br/>  For well may maids of Helle deem<br/>That this can be no earthly flower,<br/>Which mocks the tempest's withering hour,<br/>And buds unsheltered by a bower;<br/>Nor droops, though Spring refuse her shower,<br/>  Nor woos the Summer beam:<br/>To it the livelong night there sings<br/>  A Bird unseen--but not remote:<br/>Invisible his airy wings,<br/>But soft as harp that Houri strings<br/>  His long entrancing note!<br/>It were the Bulbul; but his throat,<br/>  Though mournful, pours not such a strain:<br/>For they who listen cannot leave<br/>The spot, but linger there and grieve,<br/>  As if they loved in vain!<br/>And yet so sweet the tears they shed,<br/>'Tis sorrow so unmixed with dread,<br/>They scarce can bear the morn to break<br/>  That melancholy spell,<br/>And longer yet would weep and wake,<br/>  He sings so wild and well!<br/>But when the day-blush bursts from high<br/>  Expires that magic melody.<br/>And some have been who could believe,<br/>(So fondly youthful dreams deceive,<br/>  Yet harsh be they that blame,)<br/>That note so piercing and profound<br/>Will shape and syllable its sound<br/>  Into Zuleika's name.<br/>'Tis from her cypress summit heard,<br/>That melts in air the liquid word:<br/>'Tis from her lowly virgin earth<br/>That white rose takes its tender birth.<br/>There late was laid a marble stone;<br/>Eve saw it placed--the Morrow gone!<br/>It was no mortal arm that bore<br/>That deep fixed pillar to the shore;<br/>For there, as Helle's legends tell,<br/>Next morn 'twas found where Selim fell;<br/>Lashed by the tumbling tide, whose wave<br/>Denied his bones a holier grave:<br/>And there by night, reclined, 'tis said.<br/>Is seen a ghastly turbaned head:<br/>  And hence extended by the billow,<br/>  'Tis named the "Pirate-phantom's pillow!"<br/>  Where first it lay that mourning flower<br/>  Hath flourished; flourisheth this hour,<br/>Alone and dewy--coldly pure and pale;<br/>As weeping Beauty's cheek at Sorrow's tale!
