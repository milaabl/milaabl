# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Squire's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>"HEY! Godde's mercy!" said our Hoste tho,<br/>"Now such a wife I pray God keep me fro'.<br/>Lo, suche sleightes and subtilities<br/>In women be; for aye as busy as bees<br/>Are they us silly men for to deceive,<br/>And from the soothe will they ever weive,<br/>As this Merchante's tale it proveth well.<br/>But natheless, as true as any steel,<br/>I have a wife, though that she poore be;<br/>But of her tongue a labbing shrew is she;<br/>And yet she hath a heap of vices mo'.<br/>Thereof no force; let all such thinges go.<br/>But wit ye what? in counsel be it said,<br/>Me rueth sore I am unto her tied;<br/>For, an' I shoulde reckon every vice<br/>Which that she hath, y-wis I were too nice;<br/>And cause why, it should reported be<br/>And told her by some of this company<br/>(By whom, it needeth not for to declare,<br/>Since women connen utter such chaffare ),<br/>And eke my wit sufficeth not thereto<br/>To tellen all; wherefore my tale is do.<br/>Squier, come near, if it your wille be,<br/>And say somewhat of love, for certes ye<br/>Conne thereon as much as any man."<br/>"Nay, Sir," quoth he; "but such thing as I can,<br/>With hearty will, -- for I will not rebel<br/>Against your lust, -- a tale will I tell.<br/>Have me excused if I speak amiss;<br/>My will is good; and lo, my tale is this."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>Pars Prima.<br/><br/>At Sarra, in the land of Tartary,<br/>There dwelt a king that warrayed Russie,<br/>Through which there died many a doughty man;<br/>This noble king was called Cambuscan,<br/>Which in his time was of so great renown,<br/>That there was nowhere in no regioun<br/>So excellent a lord in alle thing:<br/>Him lacked nought that longeth to a king,<br/>As of the sect of which that he was born.<br/>He kept his law to which he was y-sworn,<br/>And thereto he was hardy, wise, and rich,<br/>And piteous and just, always y-lich;<br/>True of his word, benign and honourable;<br/>Of his corage as any centre stable;<br/>Young, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous<br/>As any bachelor of all his house.<br/>A fair person he was, and fortunate,<br/>And kept alway so well his royal estate,<br/>That there was nowhere such another man.<br/>This noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan,<br/>Hadde two sons by Elfeta his wife,<br/>Of which the eldest highte Algarsife,<br/>The other was y-called Camballo.<br/>A daughter had this worthy king also,<br/>That youngest was, and highte Canace:<br/>But for to telle you all her beauty,<br/>It lies not in my tongue, nor my conning;<br/>I dare not undertake so high a thing:<br/>Mine English eke is insufficient,<br/>It muste be a rhetor excellent,<br/>That couth his colours longing for that art,<br/>If he should her describen any part;<br/>I am none such, I must speak as I can.<br/><br/>And so befell, that when this Cambuscan<br/>Had twenty winters borne his diadem,<br/>As he was wont from year to year, I deem,<br/>He let the feast of his nativity<br/>Do crye, throughout Sarra his city,<br/>The last Idus of March, after the year.<br/>Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,<br/>For he was nigh his exaltation<br/>In Marte's face, and in his mansion<br/>In Aries, the choleric hot sign:<br/>Full lusty was the weather and benign;<br/>For which the fowls against the sunne sheen,<br/>What for the season and the younge green,<br/>Full loude sange their affections:<br/>Them seemed to have got protections<br/>Against the sword of winter keen and cold.<br/>This Cambuscan, of which I have you told,<br/>In royal vesture, sat upon his dais,<br/>With diadem, full high in his palace;<br/>And held his feast so solemn and so rich,<br/>That in this worlde was there none it lich.<br/>Of which if I should tell all the array,<br/>Then would it occupy a summer's day;<br/>And eke it needeth not for to devise<br/>At every course the order of service.<br/>I will not tellen of their strange sewes,<br/>Nor of their swannes, nor their heronsews.<br/>Eke in that land, as telle knightes old,<br/>There is some meat that is full dainty hold,<br/>That in this land men reck of it full small:<br/>There is no man that may reporten all.<br/>I will not tarry you, for it is prime,<br/>And for it is no fruit, but loss of time;<br/>Unto my purpose I will have recourse.<br/>And so befell that, after the third course,<br/>While that this king sat thus in his nobley,<br/>Hearing his ministreles their thinges play<br/>Before him at his board deliciously,<br/>In at the halle door all suddenly<br/>There came a knight upon a steed of brass,<br/>And in his hand a broad mirror of glass;<br/>Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring,<br/>And by his side a naked sword hanging:<br/>And up he rode unto the highe board.<br/>In all the hall was there not spoke a word,<br/>For marvel of this knight; him to behold<br/>Full busily they waited, young and old.<br/><br/>This strange knight, that came thus suddenly,<br/>All armed, save his head, full richely,<br/>Saluted king, and queen, and lordes all,<br/>By order as they satten in the hall,<br/>With so high reverence and observance,<br/>As well in speech as in his countenance,<br/>That Gawain  with his olde courtesy,<br/>Though he were come again out of Faerie,<br/>Him coulde not amende with a word.<br/>And after this, before the highe board,<br/>He with a manly voice said his message,<br/>After the form used in his language,<br/>Withoute vice of syllable or letter.<br/>And, for his tale shoulde seem the better,<br/>Accordant to his worde's was his cheer,<br/>As teacheth art of speech them that it lear.<br/>Albeit that I cannot sound his style,<br/>Nor cannot climb over so high a stile,<br/>Yet say I this, as to commune intent,<br/>Thus much amounteth all that ever he meant,<br/>If it so be that I have it in mind.<br/>He said; "The king of Araby and Ind,<br/>My liege lord, on this solemne day<br/>Saluteth you as he best can and may,<br/>And sendeth you, in honour of your feast,<br/>By me, that am all ready at your hest,<br/>This steed of brass, that easily and well<br/>Can in the space of one day naturel<br/>(This is to say, in four-and-twenty hours),<br/>Whereso you list, in drought or else in show'rs,<br/>Beare your body into every place<br/>To which your hearte willeth for to pace,<br/>Withoute wem of you, through foul or fair.<br/>Or if you list to fly as high in air<br/>As doth an eagle, when him list to soar,<br/>This same steed shall bear you evermore<br/>Withoute harm, till ye be where you lest<br/>(Though that ye sleepen on his back, or rest),<br/>And turn again, with writhing of a pin.<br/>He that it wrought, he coude many a gin;<br/>He waited in any a constellation,<br/>Ere he had done this operation,<br/>And knew full many a seal  and many a bond<br/>This mirror eke, that I have in mine hond,<br/>Hath such a might, that men may in it see<br/>When there shall fall any adversity<br/>Unto your realm, or to yourself also,<br/>And openly who is your friend or foe.<br/>And over all this, if any lady bright<br/>Hath set her heart on any manner wight,<br/>If he be false, she shall his treason see,<br/>His newe love, and all his subtlety,<br/>So openly that there shall nothing hide.<br/>Wherefore, against this lusty summer-tide,<br/>This mirror, and this ring that ye may see,<br/>He hath sent to my lady Canace,<br/>Your excellente daughter that is here.<br/>The virtue of this ring, if ye will hear,<br/>Is this, that if her list it for to wear<br/>Upon her thumb, or in her purse it bear,<br/>There is no fowl that flyeth under heaven,<br/>That she shall not well understand his steven,<br/>And know his meaning openly and plain,<br/>And answer him in his language again:<br/>And every grass that groweth upon root<br/>She shall eke know, to whom it will do boot,<br/>All be his woundes ne'er so deep and wide.<br/>This naked sword, that hangeth by my side,<br/>Such virtue hath, that what man that it smite,<br/>Throughout his armour it will carve and bite,<br/>Were it as thick as is a branched oak:<br/>And what man is y-wounded with the stroke<br/>Shall ne'er be whole, till that you list, of grace,<br/>To stroke him with the flat in thilke place<br/>Where he is hurt; this is as much to sayn,<br/>Ye muste with the flatte sword again<br/>Stroke him upon the wound, and it will close.<br/>This is the very sooth, withoute glose;<br/>It faileth not, while it is in your hold."<br/><br/>And when this knight had thus his tale told,<br/>He rode out of the hall, and down he light.<br/>His steede, which that shone as sunne bright,<br/>Stood in the court as still as any stone.<br/>The knight is to his chamber led anon,<br/>And is unarmed, and to meat y-set.<br/>These presents be full richely y-fet, --<br/>This is to say, the sword and the mirrour, --<br/>And borne anon into the highe tow'r,<br/>With certain officers ordain'd therefor;<br/>And unto Canace the ring is bore<br/>Solemnely, where she sat at the table;<br/>But sickerly, withouten any fable,<br/>The horse of brass, that may not be remued.<br/>It stood as it were to the ground y-glued;<br/>There may no man out of the place it drive<br/>For no engine of windlass or polive;<br/>And cause why, for they can not the craft;<br/>And therefore in the place they have it laft,<br/>Till that the knight hath taught them the mannere<br/>To voide him, as ye shall after hear.<br/><br/>Great was the press, that swarmed to and fro<br/>To gauren on this horse that stoode so:<br/>For it so high was, and so broad and long,<br/>So well proportioned for to be strong,<br/>Right as it were a steed of Lombardy;<br/>Therewith so horsely, and so quick of eye,<br/>As it a gentle Poileis  courser were:<br/>For certes, from his tail unto his ear<br/>Nature nor art ne could him not amend<br/>In no degree, as all the people wend.<br/>But evermore their moste wonder was<br/>How that it coulde go, and was of brass;<br/>It was of Faerie, as the people seem'd.<br/>Diverse folk diversely they deem'd;<br/>As many heads, as many wittes been.<br/>They murmured, as doth a swarm of been,<br/>And made skills after their fantasies,<br/>Rehearsing of the olde poetries,<br/>And said that it was like the Pegasee,<br/>The horse that hadde winges for to flee;<br/>Or else it was the Greeke's horse Sinon,<br/>That broughte Troye to destruction,<br/>As men may in the olde gestes read.<br/>Mine heart," quoth one, "is evermore in dread;<br/>I trow some men of armes be therein,<br/>That shape them this city for to win:<br/>It were right good that all such thing were know."<br/>Another rowned to his fellow low,<br/>And said, "He lies; for it is rather like<br/>An apparence made by some magic,<br/>As jugglers playen at these feastes great."<br/>Of sundry doubts they jangle thus and treat.<br/>As lewed people deeme commonly<br/>Of thinges that be made more subtilly<br/>Than they can in their lewdness comprehend;<br/>They deeme gladly to the badder end.<br/>And some of them wonder'd on the mirrour,<br/>That borne was up into the master tow'r,<br/>How men might in it suche thinges see.<br/>Another answer'd and said, it might well be<br/>Naturally by compositions<br/>Of angles, and of sly reflections;<br/>And saide that in Rome was such a one.<br/>They speak of Alhazen and Vitellon,<br/>And Aristotle, that wrote in their lives<br/>Of quainte mirrors, and of prospectives,<br/>As knowe they that have their bookes heard.<br/>And other folk have wonder'd on the swerd,<br/>That woulde pierce throughout every thing;<br/>And fell in speech of Telephus the king,<br/>And of Achilles for his quainte spear,<br/>For he could with it bothe heal and dere,<br/>Right in such wise as men may with the swerd<br/>Of which right now ye have yourselves heard.<br/>They spake of sundry hard'ning of metal,<br/>And spake of medicines therewithal,<br/>And how, and when, it shoulde harden'd be,<br/>Which is unknowen algate unto me.<br/>Then spake they of Canacee's ring,<br/>And saiden all, that such a wondrous thing<br/>Of craft of rings heard they never none,<br/>Save that he, Moses, and King Solomon,<br/>Hadden a name of conning in such art.<br/>Thus said the people, and drew them apart.<br/>Put natheless some saide that it was<br/>Wonder to maken of fern ashes glass,<br/>And yet is glass nought like ashes of fern;<br/>But for they have y-knowen it so ferne<br/>Therefore ceaseth their jangling and their wonder.<br/>As sore wonder some on cause of thunder,<br/>On ebb and flood, on gossamer and mist,<br/>And on all things, till that the cause is wist.<br/>Thus jangle they, and deemen and devise,<br/>Till that the king gan from his board arise.<br/><br/>Phoebus had left the angle meridional,<br/>And yet ascending was the beast royal,<br/>The gentle Lion, with his Aldrian,<br/>When that this Tartar king, this Cambuscan,<br/>Rose from the board, there as he sat full high<br/>Before him went the loude minstrelsy,<br/>Till he came to his chamber of parements,<br/>There as they sounded diverse instruments,<br/>That it was like a heaven for to hear.<br/>Now danced lusty Venus' children dear:<br/>For in the Fish their lady sat full<br/>And looked on them with a friendly eye.<br/>This noble king is set upon his throne;<br/>This strange knight is fetched to him full sone,<br/>And on the dance he goes with Canace.<br/>Here is the revel and the jollity,<br/>That is not able a dull man to devise:<br/>He must have knowen love and his service,<br/>And been a feastly man, as fresh as May,<br/>That shoulde you devise such array.<br/>Who coulde telle you the form of dances<br/>So uncouth, and so freshe countenances<br/>Such subtle lookings and dissimulances,<br/>For dread of jealous men's apperceivings?<br/>No man but Launcelot, and he is dead.<br/>Therefore I pass o'er all this lustihead<br/>I say no more, but in this jolliness<br/>I leave them, till to supper men them dress.<br/>The steward bids the spices for to hie<br/>And eke the wine, in all this melody;<br/>The ushers and the squiers be y-gone,<br/>The spices and the wine is come anon;<br/>They eat and drink, and when this hath an end,<br/>Unto the temple, as reason was, they wend;<br/>The service done, they suppen all by day<br/>What needeth you rehearse their array?<br/>Each man wot well, that at a kinge's feast<br/>Is plenty, to the most, and to the least,<br/>And dainties more than be in my knowing.<br/><br/>At after supper went this noble king<br/>To see the horse of brass, with all a rout<br/>Of lordes and of ladies him about.<br/>Such wond'ring was there on this horse of brass,<br/>That, since the great siege of Troye was,<br/>There as men wonder'd on a horse also,<br/>Ne'er was there such a wond'ring as was tho.<br/>But finally the king asked the knight<br/>The virtue of this courser, and the might,<br/>And prayed him to tell his governance.<br/>The horse anon began to trip and dance,<br/>When that the knight laid hand upon his rein,<br/>And saide, "Sir, there is no more to sayn,<br/>But when you list to riden anywhere,<br/>Ye muste trill a pin, stands in his ear,<br/>Which I shall telle you betwixt us two;<br/>Ye muste name him to what place also,<br/>Or to what country that you list to ride.<br/>And when ye come where you list abide,<br/>Bid him descend, and trill another pin<br/>(For therein lies th' effect of all the gin),<br/>And he will down descend and do your will,<br/>And in that place he will abide still;<br/>Though all the world had the contrary swore,<br/>He shall not thence be throwen nor be bore.<br/>Or, if you list to bid him thennes gon,<br/>Trill this pin, and he will vanish anon<br/>Out of the sight of every manner wight,<br/>And come again, be it by day or night,<br/>When that you list to clepe him again<br/>In such a guise, as I shall to you sayn<br/>Betwixte you and me, and that full soon.<br/>Ride  when you list, there is no more to do'n.'<br/>Informed when the king was of the knight,<br/>And had conceived in his wit aright<br/>The manner and the form of all this thing,<br/>Full glad and blithe, this noble doughty king<br/>Repaired to his revel as beforn.<br/>The bridle is into the tower borne,<br/>And kept among his jewels lefe and dear;<br/>The horse vanish'd, I n'ot in what mannere,<br/>Out of their sight; ye get no more of me:<br/>But thus I leave in lust and jollity<br/>This Cambuscan his lordes feastying,<br/>Until well nigh the day began to spring.<br/><br/>Pars Secunda.<br/><br/>The norice of digestion, the sleep,<br/>Gan on them wink, and bade them take keep,<br/>That muche mirth and labour will have rest.<br/>And with a gaping mouth he all them kest,<br/>And said, that it was time to lie down,<br/>For blood was in his dominatioun:<br/>"Cherish the blood, nature's friend," quoth he.<br/>They thanked him gaping, by two and three;<br/>And every wight gan draw him to his rest;<br/>As sleep them bade, they took it for the best.<br/>Their dreames shall not now be told for me;<br/>Full are their heades of fumosity,<br/>That caused dreams of which there is no charge:<br/>They slepte; till that, it was prime large,<br/>The moste part, but it was Canace;<br/>She was full measurable, as women be:<br/>For of her father had she ta'en her leave<br/>To go to rest, soon after it was eve;<br/>Her liste not appalled for to be;<br/>Nor on the morrow unfeastly for to see;<br/>And slept her firste sleep; and then awoke.<br/>For such a joy she in her hearte took<br/>Both of her quainte a ring and her mirrour,.<br/>That twenty times she changed her colour;<br/>And in her sleep, right for th' impression<br/>Of her mirror, she had a vision.<br/>Wherefore, ere that the sunne gan up glide,<br/>She call'd upon her mistress' her beside,<br/>And saide, that her liste for to rise.<br/><br/>These olde women, that be gladly wise<br/>As are her mistresses answer'd anon,<br/>And said; "Madame, whither will ye gon<br/>Thus early? for the folk be all in rest."<br/>"I will," quoth she, "arise; for me lest<br/>No longer for to sleep, and walk about."<br/>Her mistresses call'd women a great rout,<br/>And up they rose, well a ten or twelve;<br/>Up rose freshe Canace herselve,<br/>As ruddy and bright as is the yonnge sun<br/>That in the Ram is four degrees y-run;<br/>No higher was he, when she ready was;<br/>And forth she walked easily a pace,<br/>Array'd after the lusty season swoot,<br/>Lightely for to play, and walk on foot,<br/>Nought but with five or six of her meinie;<br/>And in a trench forth in the park went she.<br/>The vapour, which up from the earthe glode,<br/>Made the sun to seem ruddy and broad:<br/>But, natheless, it was so fair a sight<br/>That it made all their heartes for to light,<br/>What for the season and the morrowning,<br/>And for the fowles that she hearde sing.<br/>For right anon she wiste what they meant<br/>Right by their song, and knew all their intent.<br/>The knotte, why that every tale is told,<br/>If it be tarried till the list be cold<br/>Of them that have it hearken'd after yore,<br/>The savour passeth ever longer more;<br/>For fulsomness of the prolixity:<br/>And by that same reason thinketh me.<br/>I shoulde unto the knotte condescend,<br/>And maken of her walking soon an end.<br/><br/>Amid a tree fordry, as white as chalk,<br/>There sat a falcon o'er her head full high,<br/>That with a piteous voice so gan to cry;<br/>That all the wood resounded of her cry,<br/>And beat she had herself so piteously<br/>With both her winges, till the redde blood<br/>Ran endelong the tree, there as she stood<br/>And ever-in-one alway she cried and shright;<br/>And with her beak herselfe she so pight,<br/>That there is no tiger, nor cruel beast,<br/>That dwelleth either in wood or in forest;<br/>But would have wept, if that he weepe could,<br/>For sorrow of her; she shriek'd alway so loud.<br/>For there was never yet no man alive,<br/>If that he could a falcon well descrive;<br/>That heard of such another of fairness<br/>As well of plumage, as of gentleness;<br/>Of shape, of all that mighte reckon'd be.<br/>A falcon peregrine seemed she,<br/>Of fremde land; and ever as she stood<br/>She swooned now and now for lack of blood;<br/>Till well-nigh is she fallen from the tree.<br/><br/>This faire kinge's daughter Canace,<br/>That on her finger bare the quainte ring,<br/>Through which she understood well every  thing<br/>That any fowl may in his leden sayn,<br/>And could him answer in his leden again;<br/>Hath understoode what this falcon said,<br/>And well-nigh for the ruth almost she died;.<br/>And to the tree she went, full hastily,<br/>And on this falcon looked piteously;<br/>And held her lap abroad; for well she wist<br/>The falcon muste falle from the twist<br/>When that she swooned next, for lack of blood.<br/>A longe while to waite her she stood;<br/>Till at the last she apake in this mannere<br/>Unto the hawk, as ye shall after hear:<br/>"What is the cause, if it be for to tell,<br/>That ye be in this furial pain of hell?"<br/>Quoth Canace unto this hawk above;<br/>"Is this for sorrow of of death; or loss of love?<br/>For; as I trow, these be the causes two;<br/>That cause most a gentle hearte woe:<br/>Of other harm it needeth not to speak.<br/>For ye yourself upon yourself awreak;<br/>Which proveth well, that either ire or dread<br/>Must be occasion of your cruel deed,<br/>Since that I see none other wight you chase:<br/>For love of God, as do yourselfe grace;<br/>Or what may be your help? for, west nor east,<br/>I never saw ere now no bird nor beast<br/>That fared with himself so piteously<br/>Ye slay me with your sorrow verily;<br/>I have of you so great compassioun.<br/>For Godde's love come from the tree adown<br/>And, as I am a kinge's daughter true,<br/>If that I verily the causes knew<br/>Of your disease, if it lay in my might,<br/>I would amend it, ere that it were night,<br/>So wisly help me the great God of kind.<br/>And herbes shall I right enoughe find,<br/>To heale with your hurtes hastily."<br/>Then shriek'd this falcon yet more piteously<br/>Than ever she did, and fell to ground anon,<br/>And lay aswoon, as dead as lies a stone,<br/>Till Canace had in her lap her take,<br/>Unto that time she gan of swoon awake:<br/>And, after that she out of swoon abraid,<br/>Right in her hawke's leden thus she said:<br/><br/>"That pity runneth soon in gentle heart<br/>(Feeling his simil'tude in paines smart),<br/>Is proved every day, as men may see,<br/>As well by work as by authority;<br/>For gentle hearte kitheth gentleness.<br/>I see well, that ye have on my distress<br/>Compassion, my faire Canace,<br/>Of very womanly benignity<br/>That nature in your princples hath set.<br/>But for no hope for to fare the bet,<br/>But for t' obey unto your hearte free,<br/>And for to make others aware by me,<br/>As by the whelp chastis'd is the lion,<br/>Right for that cause and that conclusion,<br/>While that I have a leisure and a space,<br/>Mine harm I will confessen ere I pace."<br/>And ever while the one her sorrow told,<br/>The other wept, as she to water wo'ld,<br/>Till that the falcon bade her to be still,<br/>And with a sigh right thus she said her till:<br/>"Where I was bred (alas that ilke day!)<br/>And foster'd in a rock of marble gray<br/>So tenderly, that nothing ailed me,<br/>I wiste not what was adversity,<br/>Till I could flee full high under the sky.<br/>Then dwell'd a tercelet  me faste by,<br/>That seem'd a well of alle gentleness;<br/>All were he full of treason and falseness,<br/>It was so wrapped under humble cheer,<br/>And under hue of truth, in such mannere,<br/>Under pleasance, and under busy pain,<br/>That no wight weened that he coulde feign,<br/>So deep in grain he dyed his colours.<br/>Right as a serpent hides him under flow'rs,<br/>Till he may see his time for to bite,<br/>Right so this god of love's hypocrite<br/>Did so his ceremonies and obeisances,<br/>And kept in semblance all his observances,<br/>That sounden unto gentleness of love.<br/>As on a tomb is all the fair above,<br/>And under is the corpse, which that ye wet,<br/>Such was this hypocrite, both cold and hot;<br/>And in this wise he served his intent,<br/>That, save the fiend, none wiste what he meant:<br/>Till he so long had weeped and complain'd,<br/>And many a year his service to me feign'd,<br/>Till that mine heart, too piteous and too nice,<br/>All innocent of his crowned malice,<br/>Forfeared of his death, as thoughte me,<br/>Upon his oathes and his surety<br/>Granted him love, on this conditioun,<br/>That evermore mine honour and renown<br/>Were saved, bothe privy and apert;<br/>This is to say, that, after his desert,<br/>I gave him all my heart and all my thought<br/>(God wot, and he, that other wayes nought),<br/>And took his heart in change of mine for aye.<br/>But sooth is said, gone since many a day,<br/>A true wight and a thiefe think not one.<br/>And when he saw the thing so far y-gone,<br/>That I had granted him fully my love,<br/>In such a wise as I have said above,<br/>And given him my true heart as free<br/>As he swore that he gave his heart to me,<br/>Anon this tiger, full of doubleness,<br/>Fell on his knees with so great humbleness,<br/>With so high reverence, as by his cheer,<br/>So like a gentle lover in mannere,<br/>So ravish'd, as it seemed, for the joy,<br/>That never Jason, nor Paris of Troy, --<br/>Jason? certes, nor ever other man,<br/>Since Lamech  was, that alderfirst began<br/>To love two, as write folk beforn,<br/>Nor ever since the firste man was born,<br/>Coulde no man, by twenty thousand<br/>Counterfeit the sophimes of his art;<br/>Where doubleness of feigning should approach,<br/>Nor worthy were t'unbuckle his galoche,<br/>Nor could so thank a wight, as he did me.<br/>His manner was a heaven for to see<br/>To any woman, were she ne'er so wise;<br/>So painted he and kempt, at point devise,<br/>As well his wordes as his countenance.<br/>And I so lov'd him for his obeisance,<br/>And for the truth I deemed in his heart,<br/>That, if so were that any thing him smart,<br/>All were it ne'er so lite, and I it wist,<br/>Methought I felt death at my hearte twist.<br/>And shortly, so farforth this thing is went,<br/>That my will was his wille's instrument;<br/>That is to say, my will obey'd his will<br/>In alle thing, as far as reason fill,<br/>Keeping the boundes of my worship ever;<br/>And never had I thing so lefe, or lever,<br/>As him, God wot, nor never shall no mo'.<br/><br/>"This lasted longer than a year or two,<br/>That I supposed of him naught but good.<br/>But finally, thus at the last it stood,<br/>That fortune woulde that he muste twin<br/>Out of that place which that I was in.<br/>Whe'er me was woe, it is no question;<br/>I cannot make of it description.<br/>For one thing dare I telle boldely,<br/>I know what is the pain of death thereby;<br/>Such harm I felt, for he might not byleve.<br/>So on a day of me he took his leave,<br/>So sorrowful eke, that I ween'd verily,<br/>That he had felt as muche harm as I,<br/>When that I heard him speak, and saw his hue.<br/>But natheless, I thought he was so true,<br/>And eke that he repaire should again<br/>Within a little while, sooth to sayn,<br/>And reason would eke that he muste go<br/>For his honour, as often happ'neth so,<br/>That I made virtue of necessity,<br/>And took it well, since that it muste be.<br/>As I best might, I hid from him my sorrow,<br/>And took him by the hand, Saint John to borrow,<br/>And said him thus; 'Lo, I am youres all;<br/>Be such as I have been to you, and shall.'<br/>What he answer'd, it needs not to rehearse;<br/>Who can say bet than he, who can do worse?<br/>When he had all well said, then had he done.<br/>Therefore behoveth him a full long spoon,<br/>That shall eat with a fiend; thus heard I say.<br/>So at the last he muste forth his way,<br/>And forth he flew, till he came where him lest.<br/>When it came him to purpose for to rest,<br/>I trow that he had thilke text in mind,<br/>That alle thing repairing to his kind<br/>Gladdeth himself;  thus say men, as I guess;<br/>Men love of [proper] kind newfangleness,<br/>As birdes do, that men in cages feed.<br/>For though thou night and day take of them heed,<br/>And strew their cage fair and soft as silk,<br/>And give them sugar, honey, bread, and milk,<br/>Yet, right anon as that his door is up,<br/>He with his feet will spurne down his cup,<br/>And to the wood he will, and wormes eat;<br/>So newefangle be they of their meat,<br/>And love novelties, of proper kind;<br/>No gentleness of bloode may them bind.<br/>So far'd this tercelet, alas the day!<br/>Though he were gentle born, and fresh, and gay,<br/>And goodly for to see, and humble, and free,<br/>He saw upon a time a kite flee,<br/>And suddenly he loved this kite so,<br/>That all his love is clean from me y-go:<br/>And hath his trothe falsed in this wise.<br/>Thus hath the kite my love in her service,<br/>And I am lorn withoute remedy."<br/><br/>And with that word this falcon gan to cry,<br/>And swooned eft in Canacee's barme<br/>Great was the sorrow, for that hawke's harm,<br/>That Canace and all her women made;<br/>They wist not how they might the falcon glade.<br/>But Canace home bare her in her lap,<br/>And softely in plasters gan her wrap,<br/>There as she with her beak had hurt herselve.<br/>Now cannot Canace but herbes delve<br/>Out of the ground, and make salves new<br/>Of herbes precious and fine of hue,<br/>To heale with this hawk; from day to night<br/>She did her business, and all her might.<br/>And by her bedde's head she made a mew,<br/>And cover'd it with velouettes blue,<br/>In sign of truth that is in woman seen;<br/>And all without the mew is painted green,<br/>In which were painted all these false fowls,<br/>As be these tidifes, tercelets, and owls;<br/>And pies, on them for to cry and chide,<br/>Right for despite were painted them beside.<br/><br/>Thus leave I Canace her hawk keeping.<br/>I will no more as now speak of her ring,<br/>Till it come eft to purpose for to sayn<br/>How that this falcon got her love again<br/>Repentant, as the story telleth us,<br/>By mediation of Camballus,<br/>The kinge's son of which that I you told.<br/>But henceforth I will my process hold<br/>To speak of aventures, and of battailes,<br/>That yet was never heard so great marvailles.<br/>First I will telle you of Cambuscan,<br/>That in his time many a city wan;<br/>And after will I speak of Algarsife,<br/>How he won Theodora to his wife,<br/>For whom full oft in great peril he was,<br/>N'had he been holpen by the horse of brass.<br/>And after will I speak of Camballo,<br/>That fought in listes with the brethren two<br/>For Canace, ere that he might her win;<br/>And where I left I will again begin.
