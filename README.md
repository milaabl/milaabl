  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Alastor: Or, the Spirit of Solitude by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    'The good die first,<br/>And those whose hearts are dry as summer dust,<br/>Burn to the socket!'<br/><br/>Earth, Ocean, Air, beloved brotherhood!<br/>If our great Mother has imbued my soul<br/>With aught of natural piety to feel<br/>Your love, and recompense the boon with mine;<br/>If dewy morn, and odorous noon, and even,<br/>With sunset and its gorgeous ministers,<br/>And solemn midnight's tingling silentness;<br/>If autumn's hollow sighs in the sere wood,<br/>And winter robing with pure snow and crowns<br/>Of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs;<br/>If spring's voluptuous pantings when she breathes<br/>Her first sweet kisses, have been dear to me;<br/>If no bright bird, insect, or gentle beast<br/>I consciously have injured, but still loved<br/>And cherished these my kindred; then forgive<br/>This boast, beloved brethren, and withdraw<br/>No portion of your wonted favour now!<br/><br/>Mother of this unfathomable world!<br/>Favour my solemn song, for I have loved<br/>Thee ever, and thee only; I have watched<br/>Thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps,<br/>And my heart ever gazes on the depth<br/>Of thy deep mysteries. I have made my bed<br/>In charnels and on coffins, where black death<br/>Keeps record of the trophies won from thee,<br/>Hoping to still these obstinate questionings<br/>Of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost,<br/>Thy messenger, to render up the tale<br/>Of what we are. In lone and silent hours,<br/>When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness,<br/>Like an inspired and desperate alchymist<br/>Staking his very life on some dark hope,<br/>Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks<br/>With my most innocent love, until strange tears,<br/>Uniting with those breathless kisses, made<br/>Such magic as compels the charmed night<br/>To render up thy charge:...and, though ne'er yet<br/>Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary,<br/>Enough from incommunicable dream,<br/>And twilight phantasms, and deep noon-day thought,<br/>Has shone within me, that serenely now<br/>And moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre<br/>Suspended in the solitary dome<br/>Of some mysterious and deserted fane,<br/>I wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain<br/>May modulate with murmurs of the air,<br/>And motions of the forests and the sea,<br/>And voice of living beings, and woven hymns<br/>Of night and day, and the deep heart of man.<br/><br/>There was a Poet whose untimely tomb<br/>No human hands with pious reverence reared,<br/>But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds<br/>Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid<br/>Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:--<br/>A lovely youth,--no mourning maiden decked<br/>With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,<br/>The lone couch of his everlasting sleep:--<br/>Gentle, and brave, and generous,--no lorn bard<br/>Breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh:<br/>He lived, he died, he sung in solitude.<br/>Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,<br/>And virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined<br/>And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.<br/>The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,<br/>And Silence, too enamoured of that voice,<br/>Locks its mute music in her rugged cell.<br/><br/>By solemn vision, and bright silver dream<br/>His infancy was nurtured. Every sight<br/>And sound from the vast earth and ambient air,<br/>Sent to his heart its choicest impulses.<br/>The fountains of divine philosophy<br/>Fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great,<br/>Or good, or lovely, which the sacred past<br/>In truth or fable consecrates, he felt<br/>And knew. When early youth had passed, he left<br/>His cold fireside and alienated home<br/>To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands.<br/>Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness<br/>Has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought<br/>With his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men,<br/>His rest and food. Nature's most secret steps<br/>He like her shadow has pursued, where'er<br/>The red volcano overcanopies<br/>Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice<br/>With burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes<br/>On black bare pointed islets ever beat<br/>With sluggish surge, or where the secret caves,<br/>Rugged and dark, winding among the springs<br/>Of fire and poison, inaccessible<br/>To avarice or pride, their starry domes<br/>Of diamond and of gold expand above<br/>Numberless and immeasurable halls,<br/>Frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines<br/>Of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite.<br/>Nor had that scene of ampler majesty<br/>Than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven<br/>And the green earth lost in his heart its claims<br/>To love and wonder; he would linger long<br/>In lonesome vales, making the wild his home,<br/>Until the doves and squirrels would partake<br/>From his innocuous hand his bloodless food,<br/>Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks,<br/>And the wild antelope, that starts whene'er<br/>The dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend<br/>Her timid steps, to gaze upon a form<br/>More graceful than her own.<br/>His wandering step,<br/>Obedient to high thoughts, has visited<br/>The awful ruins of the days of old:<br/>Athens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste<br/>Where stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers<br/>Of Babylon, the eternal pyramids,<br/>Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange,<br/>Sculptured on alabaster obelisk,<br/>Or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphynx,<br/>Dark Aethiopia in her desert hills<br/>Conceals. Among the ruined temples there,<br/>Stupendous columns, and wild images<br/>Of more than man, where marble daemons watch<br/>The Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men<br/>Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around,<br/>He lingered, poring on memorials<br/>Of the world's youth: through the long burning day<br/>Gazed on those speechless shapes; nor, when the moon<br/>Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades<br/>Suspended he that task, but ever gazed<br/>And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind<br/>Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw<br/>The thrilling secrets of the birth of time.<br/><br/>Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,<br/>Her daily portion, from her father's tent,<br/>And spread her matting for his couch, and stole<br/>From duties and repose to tend his steps,<br/>Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe<br/>To speak her love:--and watched his nightly sleep,<br/>Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips<br/>Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath<br/>Of innocent dreams arose; then, when red morn<br/>Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home<br/>Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned.<br/><br/>The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie,<br/>And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,<br/>And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down<br/>Indus and Oxus from their icy caves,<br/>In joy and exultation held his way;<br/>Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within<br/>Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine<br/>Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,<br/>Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched<br/>His languid limbs. A vision on his sleep<br/>There came, a dream of hopes that never yet<br/>Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veiled maid<br/>Sate near him, talking in low solemn tones.<br/>Her voice was like the voice of his own soul<br/>Heard in the calm of thought; its music long,<br/>Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held<br/>His inmost sense suspended in its web<br/>Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues.<br/>Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,<br/>And lofty hopes of divine liberty,<br/>Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy,<br/>Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood<br/>Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame<br/>A permeating fire; wild numbers then<br/>She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs<br/>Subdued by its own pathos; her fair hands<br/>Were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp<br/>Strange symphony, and in their branching veins<br/>The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.<br/>The beating of her heart was heard to fill<br/>The pauses of her music, and her breath<br/>Tumultuously accorded with those fits<br/>Of intermitted song. Sudden she rose,<br/>As if her heart impatiently endured<br/>Its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned,<br/>And saw by the warm light of their own life<br/>Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil<br/>Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,<br/>Her dark locks floating in the breath of night,<br/>Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips<br/>Outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly.<br/>His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess<br/>Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled<br/>His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet<br/>Her panting bosom:...she drew back a while,<br/>Then, yielding to the irresistible joy,<br/>With frantic gesture and short breathless cry<br/>Folded his frame in her dissolving arms.<br/>Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night<br/>Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,<br/>Like a dark flood suspended in its course,<br/>Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.<br/><br/>Roused by the shock he started from his trance--<br/>The cold white light of morning, the blue moon<br/>Low in the west, the clear and garish hills,<br/>The distinct valley and the vacant woods,<br/>Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled<br/>The hues of heaven that canopied his bower<br/>Of yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep,<br/>The mystery and the majesty of Earth,<br/>The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes<br/>Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly<br/>As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven.<br/>The spirit of sweet human love has sent<br/>A vision to the sleep of him who spurned<br/>Her choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues<br/>Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade;<br/>He overleaps the bounds. Alas! Alas!<br/>Were limbs, and breath, and being intertwined<br/>Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, for ever lost<br/>In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep,<br/>That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death<br/>Conduct to thy mysterious paradise,<br/>O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds<br/>And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake,<br/>Lead only to a black and watery depth,<br/>While death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung,<br/>Where every shade which the foul grave exhales<br/>Hides its dead eye from the detested day,<br/>Conducts, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms?<br/>This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart;<br/>The insatiate hope which it awakened, stung<br/>His brain even like despair.<br/>While daylight held<br/>The sky, the Poet kept mute conference<br/>With his still soul. At night the passion came,<br/>Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,<br/>And shook him from his rest, and led him forth<br/>Into the darkness.--As an eagle, grasped<br/>In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast<br/>Burn with the poison, and precipitates<br/>Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud,<br/>Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight<br/>O'er the wide aery wilderness: thus driven<br/>By the bright shadow of that lovely dream,<br/>Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night,<br/>Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,<br/>Startling with careless step the moonlight snake,<br/>He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,<br/>Shedding the mockery of its vital hues<br/>Upon his cheek of death. He wandered on<br/>Till vast Aornos seen from Petra's steep<br/>Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud;<br/>Through Balk, and where the desolated tombs<br/>Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind<br/>Their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on,<br/>Day after day a weary waste of hours,<br/>Bearing within his life the brooding care<br/>That ever fed on its decaying flame.<br/>And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair,<br/>Sered by the autumn of strange suffering<br/>Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand<br/>Hung like dead bone within its withered skin;<br/>Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone<br/>As in a furnace burning secretly<br/>From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers,<br/>Who ministered with human charity<br/>His human wants, beheld with wondering awe<br/>Their fleeting visitant. The mountaineer,<br/>Encountering on some dizzy precipice<br/>That spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of wind<br/>With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet<br/>Disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused<br/>In its career: the infant would conceal<br/>His troubled visage in his mother's robe<br/>In terror at the glare of those wild eyes,<br/>To remember their strange light in many a dream<br/>Of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught<br/>By nature, would interpret half the woe<br/>That wasted him, would call him with false names<br/>Brother and friend, would press his pallid hand<br/>At parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path<br/>Of his departure from their father's door.<br/><br/>At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore<br/>He paused, a wide and melancholy waste<br/>Of putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged<br/>His steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,<br/>Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds.<br/>It rose as he approached, and, with strong wings<br/>Scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course<br/>High over the immeasurable main.<br/>His eyes pursued its flight:--'Thou hast a home,<br/>Beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home,<br/>Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck<br/>With thine, and welcome thy return with eyes<br/>Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy.<br/>And what am I that I should linger here,<br/>With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes,<br/>Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned<br/>To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers<br/>In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven<br/>That echoes not my thoughts?' A gloomy smile<br/>Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips.<br/>For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly<br/>Its precious charge, and silent death exposed,<br/>Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure,<br/>With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms.<br/><br/>Startled by his own thoughts he looked around.<br/>There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight<br/>Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind.<br/>A little shallop floating near the shore<br/>Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze.<br/>It had been long abandoned, for its sides<br/>Gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints<br/>Swayed with the undulations of the tide.<br/>A restless impulse urged him to embark<br/>And meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste;<br/>For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves<br/>The slimy caverns of the populous deep.<br/><br/>The day was fair and sunny; sea and sky<br/>Drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind<br/>Swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves.<br/>Following his eager soul, the wanderer<br/>Leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft<br/>On the bare mast, and took his lonely seat,<br/>And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea<br/>Like a torn cloud before the hurricane.<br/><br/>As one that in a silver vision floats<br/>Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds<br/>Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly<br/>Along the dark and ruffled waters fled<br/>The straining boat.--A whirlwind swept it on,<br/>With fierce gusts and precipitating force,<br/>Through the white ridges of the chafed sea.<br/>The waves arose. Higher and higher still<br/>Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge<br/>Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp.<br/>Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war<br/>Of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast<br/>Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven<br/>With dark obliterating course, he sate:<br/>As if their genii were the ministers<br/>Appointed to conduct him to the light<br/>Of those beloved eyes, the Poet sate,<br/>Holding the steady helm. Evening came on,<br/>The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues<br/>High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray<br/>That canopied his path o'er the waste deep;<br/>Twilight, ascending slowly from the east,<br/>Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks<br/>O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day;<br/>Night followed, clad with stars. On every side<br/>More horribly the multitudinous streams<br/>Of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war<br/>Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock<br/>The calm and spangled sky. The little boat<br/>Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam<br/>Down the steep cataract of a wintry river;<br/>Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave;<br/>Now leaving far behind the bursting mass<br/>That fell, convulsing ocean: safely fled--<br/>As if that frail and wasted human form,<br/>Had been an elemental god.<br/><br/>At midnight<br/>The moon arose; and lo! the ethereal cliffs<br/>Of Caucasus, whose icy summits shone<br/>Among the stars like sunlight, and around<br/>Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves<br/>Bursting and eddying irresistibly<br/>Rage and resound forever.--Who shall save?--<br/>The boat fled on,--the boiling torrent drove,--<br/>The crags closed round with black and jagged arms,<br/>The shattered mountain overhung the sea,<br/>And faster still, beyond all human speed,<br/>Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave,<br/>The little boat was driven. A cavern there<br/>Yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths<br/>Ingulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on<br/>With unrelaxing speed.--'Vision and Love!'<br/>The Poet cried aloud, 'I have beheld<br/>The path of thy departure. Sleep and death<br/>Shall not divide us long.'<br/><br/>The boat pursued<br/>The windings of the cavern. Daylight shone<br/>At length upon that gloomy river's flow;<br/>Now, where the fiercest war among the waves<br/>Is calm, on the unfathomable stream<br/>The boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven,<br/>Exposed those black depths to the azure sky,<br/>Ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell<br/>Even to the base of Caucasus, with sound<br/>That shook the everlasting rocks, the mass<br/>Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm:<br/>Stair above stair the eddying waters rose,<br/>Circling immeasurably fast, and laved<br/>With alternating dash the gnarled roots<br/>Of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms<br/>In darkness over it. I' the midst was left,<br/>Reflecting, yet distorting every cloud,<br/>A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm.<br/>Seized by the sway of the ascending stream,<br/>With dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round,<br/>Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose,<br/>Till on the verge of the extremest curve,<br/>Where, through an opening of the rocky bank,<br/>The waters overflow, and a smooth spot<br/>Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides<br/>Is left, the boat paused shuddering.--Shall it sink<br/>Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress<br/>Of that resistless gulf embosom it?<br/>Now shall it fall?--A wandering stream of wind,<br/>Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,<br/>And, lo! with gentle motion, between banks<br/>Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream,<br/>Beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark!<br/>The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar,<br/>With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods.<br/>Where the embowering trees recede, and leave<br/>A little space of green expanse, the cove<br/>Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers<br/>For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes,<br/>Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave<br/>Of the boat's motion marred their pensive task,<br/>Which naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind,<br/>Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay<br/>Had e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed<br/>To deck with their bright hues his withered hair,<br/>But on his heart its solitude returned,<br/>And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid<br/>In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame<br/>Had yet performed its ministry: it hung<br/>Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud<br/>Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods<br/>Of night close over it.<br/>The noonday sun<br/>Now shone upon the forest, one vast mass<br/>Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence<br/>A narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves,<br/>Scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks,<br/>Mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever.<br/>The meeting boughs and implicated leaves<br/>Wove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as led<br/>By love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death,<br/>He sought in Nature's dearest haunt some bank,<br/>Her cradle, and his sepulchre. More dark<br/>And dark the shades accumulate. The oak,<br/>Expanding its immense and knotty arms,<br/>Embraces the light beech. The pyramids<br/>Of the tall cedar overarching frame<br/>Most solemn domes within, and far below,<br/>Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky,<br/>The ash and the acacia floating hang<br/>Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed<br/>In rainbow and in fire, the parasites,<br/>Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around<br/>The grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,<br/>With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,<br/>Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,<br/>These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs<br/>Uniting their close union; the woven leaves<br/>Make net-work of the dark blue light of day,<br/>And the night's noontide clearness, mutable<br/>As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns<br/>Beneath these canopies extend their swells,<br/>Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms<br/>Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen<br/>Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine,<br/>A soul-dissolving odour to invite<br/>To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell,<br/>Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep<br/>Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades,<br/>Like vaporous shapes half-seen; beyond, a well,<br/>Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave,<br/>Images all the woven boughs above,<br/>And each depending leaf, and every speck<br/>Of azure sky, darting between their chasms;<br/>Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves<br/>Its portraiture, but some inconstant star<br/>Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,<br/>Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,<br/>Or gorgeous insect floating motionless,<br/>Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings<br/>Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon.<br/><br/>Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld<br/>Their own wan light through the reflected lines<br/>Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth<br/>Of that still fountain; as the human heart,<br/>Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,<br/>Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard<br/>The motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung<br/>Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel<br/>An unaccustomed presence, and the sound<br/>Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs<br/>Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed<br/>To stand beside him--clothed in no bright robes<br/>Of shadowy silver or enshrining light,<br/>Borrowed from aught the visible world affords<br/>Of grace, or majesty, or mystery;--<br/>But, undulating woods, and silent well,<br/>And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom<br/>Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,<br/>Held commune with him, as if he and it<br/>Were all that was,--only...when his regard<br/>Was raised by intense pensiveness,...two eyes,<br/>Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought,<br/>And seemed with their serene and azure smiles<br/>To beckon him.<br/><br/>Obedient to the light<br/>That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing<br/>The windings of the dell.--The rivulet,<br/>Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine<br/>Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell<br/>Among the moss with hollow harmony<br/>Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones<br/>It danced; like childhood laughing as it went:<br/>Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept,<br/>Reflecting every herb and drooping bud<br/>That overhung its quietness.--'O stream!<br/>Whose source is inaccessibly profound,<br/>Whither do thy mysterious waters tend?<br/>Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,<br/>Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,<br/>Thy searchless fountain, and invisible course<br/>Have each their type in me; and the wide sky.<br/>And measureless ocean may declare as soon<br/>What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud<br/>Contains thy waters, as the universe<br/>Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched<br/>Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste<br/>I' the passing wind!'<br/><br/>Beside the grassy shore<br/>Of the small stream he went; he did impress<br/>On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught<br/>Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one<br/>Roused by some joyous madness from the couch<br/>Of fever, he did move; yet, not like him,<br/>Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame<br/>Of his frail exultation shall be spent,<br/>He must descend. With rapid steps he went<br/>Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow<br/>Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now<br/>The forest's solemn canopies were changed<br/>For the uniform and lightsome evening sky.<br/>Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed<br/>The struggling brook; tall spires of windlestrae<br/>Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope,<br/>And nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines<br/>Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots<br/>The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here,<br/>Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,<br/>The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin<br/>And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes<br/>Had shone, gleam stony orbs:--so from his steps<br/>Bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade<br/>Of the green groves, with all their odorous winds<br/>And musical motions. Calm, he still pursued<br/>The stream, that with a larger volume now<br/>Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there<br/>Fretted a path through its descending curves<br/>With its wintry speed. On every side now rose<br/>Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms,<br/>Lifted their black and barren pinnacles<br/>In the light of evening, and its precipice<br/>Obscuring the ravine, disclosed above,<br/>Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves,<br/>Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues<br/>To the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands<br/>Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,<br/>And seems, with its accumulated crags,<br/>To overhang the world: for wide expand<br/>Beneath the wan stars and descending moon<br/>Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,<br/>Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom<br/>Of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills<br/>Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge<br/>Of the remote horizon. The near scene,<br/>In naked and severe simplicity,<br/>Made contrast with the universe. A pine,<br/>Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy<br/>Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast<br/>Yielding one only response, at each pause<br/>In most familiar cadence, with the howl<br/>The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams<br/>Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river<br/>Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,<br/>Fell into that immeasurable void<br/>Scattering its waters to the passing winds.<br/><br/>Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine<br/>And torrent were not all;--one silent nook<br/>Was there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,<br/>Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,<br/>It overlooked in its serenity<br/>The dark earth, and the bending vault of stars.<br/>It was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile<br/>Even in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped<br/>The fissured stones with its entwining arms,<br/>And did embower with leaves for ever green,<br/>And berries dark, the smooth and even space<br/>Of its inviolated floor, and here<br/>The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore,<br/>In wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay,<br/>Red, yellow, or ethereally pale,<br/>Rivals the pride of summer. 'Tis the haunt<br/>Of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach<br/>The wilds to love tranquillity. One step,<br/>One human step alone, has ever broken<br/>The stillness of its solitude:--one voice<br/>Alone inspired its echoes;--even that voice<br/>Which hither came, floating among the winds,<br/>And led the loveliest among human forms<br/>To make their wild haunts the depository<br/>Of all the grace and beauty that endued<br/>Its motions, render up its majesty,<br/>Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm,<br/>And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,<br/>Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,<br/>Commit the colours of that varying cheek,<br/>That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes.<br/><br/>The dim and horned moon hung low, and poured<br/>A sea of lustre on the horizon's verge<br/>That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist<br/>Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank<br/>Wan moonlight even to fulness; not a star<br/>Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,<br/>Danger's grim playmates, on that precipice<br/>Slept, clasped in his embrace.--O, storm of death!<br/>Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night: 610<br/>And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still<br/>Guiding its irresistible career<br/>In thy devastating omnipotence,<br/>Art king of this frail world, from the red field<br/>Of slaughter, from the reeking hospital,<br/>The patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed<br/>Of innocence, the scaffold and the throne,<br/>A mighty voice invokes thee. Ruin calls<br/>His brother Death. A rare and regal prey<br/>He hath prepared, prowling around the world;<br/>Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men<br/>Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,<br/>Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine<br/>The unheeded tribute of a broken heart.<br/><br/>When on the threshold of the green recess<br/>The wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death<br/>Was on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,<br/>Did he resign his high and holy soul<br/>To images of the majestic past,<br/>That paused within his passive being now,<br/>Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe<br/>Through some dim latticed chamber. He did place<br/>His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk<br/>Of the old pine. Upon an ivied stone<br/>Reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest,<br/>Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink<br/>Of that obscurest chasm;--and thus he lay,<br/>Surrendering to their final impulses<br/>The hovering powers of life. Hope and despair,<br/>The torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear<br/>Marred his repose; the influxes of sense,<br/>And his own being unalloyed by pain,<br/>Yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed<br/>The stream of thought, till he lay breathing there<br/>At peace, and faintly smiling:--his last sight<br/>Was the great moon, which o'er the western line<br/>Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended,<br/>With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed<br/>To mingle. Now upon the jagged hills<br/>It rests; and still as the divided frame<br/>Of the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood,<br/>That ever beat in mystic sympathy<br/>With nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still:<br/>And when two lessening points of light alone<br/>Gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp<br/>Of his faint respiration scarce did stir<br/>The stagnate night:--till the minutest ray<br/>Was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart.<br/>It paused--it fluttered. But when heaven remained<br/>Utterly black, the murky shades involved<br/>An image, silent, cold, and motionless,<br/>As their own voiceless earth and vacant air.<br/>Even as a vapour fed with golden beams<br/>That ministered on sunlight, ere the west<br/>Eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame--<br/>No sense, no motion, no divinity--<br/>A fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings<br/>The breath of heaven did wander--a bright stream<br/>Once fed with many-voiced waves--a dream<br/>Of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever,<br/>Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now.<br/><br/>Oh, for Medea's wondrous alchemy,<br/>Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam<br/>With bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale<br/>From vernal blooms fresh fragrance! O, that God,<br/>Profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice<br/>Which but one living man has drained, who now,<br/>Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels<br/>No proud exemption in the blighting curse<br/>He bears, over the world wanders for ever,<br/>Lone as incarnate death! O, that the dream<br/>Of dark magician in his visioned cave,<br/>Raking the cinders of a crucible<br/>For life and power, even when his feeble hand<br/>Shakes in its last decay, were the true law<br/>Of this so lovely world! But thou art fled,<br/>Like some frail exhalation; which the dawn<br/>Robes in its golden beams,--ah! thou hast fled!<br/>The brave, the gentle and the beautiful,<br/>The child of grace and genius. Heartless things<br/>Are done and said i' the world, and many worms<br/>And beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth<br/>From sea and mountain, city and wilderness,<br/>In vesper low or joyous orison,<br/>Lifts still its solemn voice:--but thou art fled--<br/>Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes<br/>Of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee<br/>Been purest ministers, who are, alas!<br/>Now thou art not. Upon those pallid lips<br/>So sweet even in their silence, on those eyes<br/>That image sleep in death, upon that form<br/>Yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear<br/>Be shed--not even in thought. Nor, when those hues<br/>Are gone, and those divinest lineaments,<br/>Worn by the senseless wind, shall live alone<br/>In the frail pauses of this simple strain,<br/>Let not high verse, mourning the memory<br/>Of that which is no more, or painting's woe<br/>Or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery<br/>Their own cold powers. Art and eloquence,<br/>And all the shows o' the world are frail and vain<br/>To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade.<br/>It is a woe "too deep for tears," when all<br/>Is reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,<br/>Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves<br/>Those who remain behind, not sobs or groans,<br/>The passionate tumult of a clinging hope;<br/>But pale despair and cold tranquillity,<br/>Nature's vast frame, the web of human things,<br/>Birth and the grave, that are not as they were.
