  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Samson Agonistes by *John Milton*

<p>
    Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.<br/><br/><br/>TRAGEDY, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the<br/>gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems:<br/>therefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear,<br/>or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is<br/>to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight,<br/>stirr'd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is<br/>Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for<br/>so in Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are us'd against<br/>melancholy, sowr against sowr, salt to remove salt humours.<br/>Hence Philosophers and other gravest Writers, as Cicero, Plutarch<br/>and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and<br/>illustrate thir discourse.  The Apostle Paul himself thought it not<br/>unworthy to insert a verse of Euripides into the Text of Holy<br/>Scripture, I Cor. 15. 33. and Paraeus commenting on the<br/>Revelation, divides the whole Book as a Tragedy, into Acts<br/>distinguisht each by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song<br/>between.  Heretofore Men in highest dignity have labour'd not a<br/>little to be thought able to compose a Tragedy.  Of that honour<br/>Dionysius the elder was no less ambitious, then before of his<br/>attaining to the Tyranny. Augustus Caesar also had begun his<br/>Ajax, but unable to please his own judgment with what he had<br/>begun. left it unfinisht.  Seneca the Philosopher is by some thought<br/>the Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go<br/>under that name.  Gregory Nazianzen a Father of the Church,<br/>thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a<br/>Tragedy which he entitl'd, Christ suffering. This is mention'd to<br/>vindicate Tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which<br/>in the account of many it undergoes at this day with other common<br/>Interludes; hap'ning through the Poets error of intermixing Comic<br/>stuff with Tragic sadness and gravity; or introducing trivial and<br/>vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd; and<br/>brought in without discretion, corruptly to gratifie the people. And<br/>though antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet using sometimes, in<br/>case of self defence, or explanation, that which Martial calls an<br/>Epistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth after the antient<br/>manner, much different from what among us passes for best, thus<br/>much before-hand may be Epistl'd; that Chorus is here introduc'd<br/>after the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and still in<br/>use among the Italians. In the modelling therefore of this Poem<br/>with good reason, the Antients and Italians are rather follow'd, as<br/>of much more authority and fame. The measure of Verse us'd in<br/>the Chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the Greeks Monostrophic, or<br/>rather Apolelymenon, without regard had to Strophe, Antistrophe<br/>or Epod, which were a kind of Stanza's fram'd only for the Music,<br/>then us'd with the Chorus that sung; not essential to the Poem, and<br/>therefore not material; or being divided into Stanza's or Pauses<br/>they may be call'd Allaeostropha.  Division into Act and Scene<br/>referring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work never was<br/>intended) is here omitted.<br/><br/> It suffices if the whole Drama be found not produc't beyond the<br/>fift Act, of the style and uniformitie, and that commonly call'd the<br/>Plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such<br/>oeconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with<br/>verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not<br/>unacquainted with Aeschulus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three<br/>Tragic Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule to all who<br/>endeavour to write Tragedy. The circumscription of time wherein<br/>the whole Drama begins and ends, is according to antient rule, and<br/>best example, within the space of 24 hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The ARGUMENT.<br/><br/><br/>Samson made Captive, Blind, and now in the Prison at Gaza, there<br/>to labour as in a common work-house, on a Festival day, in the<br/>general cessation from labour, comes forth into the open Air, to a<br/>place nigh, somewhat retir'd there to sit a while and bemoan his<br/>condition. Where he happens at length to be visited by certain<br/>friends and equals of his tribe, which make the Chorus, who seek<br/>to comfort him what they can ; then by his old Father Manoa, who<br/>endeavours the like, and withal tells him his purpose to procure his<br/>liberty by ransom; lastly, that this Feast was proclaim'd by the<br/>Philistins as a day of Thanksgiving for thir deliverance from the<br/>hands of Samson, which yet more troubles him.  Manoa then<br/>departs to prosecute his endeavour with the Philistian Lords for<br/>Samson's redemption; who in the mean while is visited by other<br/>persons; and lastly by a publick Officer to require coming to the<br/>Feast before the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength in<br/>thir presence; he at first refuses, dismissing the publick officer with<br/>absolute denyal to come; at length perswaded inwardly that this<br/>was from God, he yields to go along with him, who came now the<br/>second time with great threatnings to fetch him; the Chorus yet<br/>remaining on the place, Manoa returns full of joyful hope, to<br/>procure e're long his Sons deliverance: in the midst of which<br/>discourse an Ebrew comes in haste confusedly at first; and<br/>afterward more distinctly relating the Catastrophe, what Samson<br/>had done to the Philistins, and by accident to himself; wherewith<br/>the Tragedy ends.<br/><br/><br/>The Persons<br/><br/>Samson.<br/>Manoa the father of Samson.<br/>Dalila his wife.<br/>Harapha of Gath.<br/>Publick Officer.<br/>Messenger.<br/>Chorus of Danites<br/><br/><br/>The Scene before the Prison in Gaza.<br/><br/>Sam:  A little onward lend thy guiding hand<br/>To these dark steps, a little further on;<br/>For yonder bank hath choice of Sun or shade,<br/>There I am wont to sit, when any chance<br/>Relieves me from my task of servile toyl,<br/>Daily in the common Prison else enjoyn'd me,<br/>Where I a Prisoner chain'd, scarce freely draw<br/>The air imprison'd also, close and damp,<br/>Unwholsom draught: but here I feel amends,<br/>The breath of Heav'n fresh-blowing, pure and sweet,<br/>With day-spring born; here leave me to respire.<br/>This day a solemn Feast the people hold<br/>To Dagon thir Sea-Idol, and forbid<br/>Laborious works, unwillingly this rest<br/>Thir Superstition yields me; hence with leave<br/>Retiring from the popular noise, I seek<br/>This unfrequented place to find some ease,<br/>Ease to the body some, none to the mind<br/>From restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm<br/>Of Hornets arm'd, no sooner found alone,<br/>But rush upon me thronging, and present<br/>Times past, what once I was, and what am now.<br/>O wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold<br/>Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight<br/>Of both my Parents all in flames ascended<br/>From off the Altar, where an Off'ring burn'd,<br/>As in a fiery column charioting<br/>His Godlike presence, and from some great act<br/>Or benefit reveal'd to Abraham's race?<br/>Why was my breeding order'd and prescrib'd<br/>As of a person separate to God,<br/>Design'd for great exploits; if I must dye<br/>Betray'd, Captiv'd, and both my Eyes put out,<br/>Made of my Enemies the scorn and gaze;<br/>To grind in Brazen Fetters under task<br/>With this Heav'n-gifted strength? O glorious strength<br/>Put to the labour of a Beast, debas't<br/>Lower then bondslave! Promise was that I<br/>Should Israel from Philistian yoke deliver;<br/>Ask for this great Deliverer now, and find him<br/>Eyeless in Gaza at the Mill with slaves,<br/>Himself in bonds under Philistian yoke;<br/>Yet stay, let me not rashly call in doubt<br/>Divine Prediction; what if all foretold<br/>Had been fulfilld but through mine own default,<br/>Whom have I to complain of but my self?<br/>Who this high gift of strength committed to me,<br/>In what part lodg'd, how easily bereft me,<br/>Under the Seal of silence could not keep,<br/>But weakly to a woman must reveal it<br/>O'recome with importunity and tears.<br/>O impotence of mind, in body strong!<br/>But what is strength without a double share<br/>Of wisdom, vast, unwieldy, burdensom,<br/>Proudly secure, yet liable to fall<br/>By weakest suttleties, not made to rule,<br/>But to subserve where wisdom bears command.<br/>God, when he gave me strength, to shew withal<br/>How slight the gift was, hung it in my Hair.<br/>But peace, I must not quarrel with the will<br/>Of highest dispensation, which herein<br/>Happ'ly had ends above my reach to know:<br/>Suffices that to me strength is my bane,<br/>And proves the sourse of all my miseries;<br/>So many, and so huge, that each apart<br/>Would ask a life to wail, but chief of all,<br/>O loss of sight, of thee I most complain!<br/>Blind among enemies, O worse then chains,<br/>Dungeon, or beggery, or decrepit age!<br/>Light the prime work of God to me is extinct,<br/>And all her various objects of delight<br/>Annull'd, which might in part my grief have eas'd,<br/>Inferiour to the vilest now become<br/>Of man or worm; the vilest here excel me,<br/>They creep, yet see, I dark in light expos'd<br/>To daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,<br/>Within doors, or without, still as a fool,<br/>In power of others, never in my own;<br/>Scarce half I seem to live, dead more then half.<br/>O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,<br/>Irrecoverably dark, total Eclipse<br/>Without all hope of day!<br/>O first created Beam, and thou great Word,<br/>Let there be light, and light was over all;<br/>Why am I thus bereav'd thy prime decree?<br/>The Sun to me is dark<br/>And silent as the Moon,<br/>When she deserts the night<br/>Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.<br/>Since light so necessary is to life,<br/>And almost life itself, if it be true<br/>That light is in the Soul,<br/>She all in every part; why was the sight<br/>To such a tender ball as th' eye confin'd?<br/>So obvious and so easie to be quench't,<br/>And not as feeling through all parts diffus'd,<br/>That she might look at will through every pore?<br/>Then had I not been thus exil'd from light;<br/>As in the land of darkness yet in light,<br/>To live a life half dead, a living death,<br/>And buried; but O yet more miserable!<br/>My self, my Sepulcher, a moving Grave,<br/>Buried, yet not exempt<br/>By priviledge of death and burial<br/>From worst of other evils, pains and wrongs,<br/>But made hereby obnoxious more<br/>To all the miseries of life,<br/>Life in captivity<br/>Among inhuman foes.<br/>But who are these? for with joint pace I hear<br/>The tread of many feet stearing this way;<br/>Perhaps my enemies who come to stare<br/>At my affliction, and perhaps to insult,<br/>Thir daily practice to afflict me more.<br/><br/>Chor:  This, this is he; softly a while,<br/>Let us not break in upon him;<br/>O change beyond report, thought, or belief!<br/>See how he lies at random, carelessly diffus'd,<br/>With languish't head unpropt,<br/>As one past hope, abandon'd<br/>And by himself given over;<br/>In slavish habit, ill-fitted weeds<br/>O're worn and soild;<br/>Or do my eyes misrepresent?  Can this be hee,<br/>That Heroic, that Renown'd,<br/>Irresistible Samson? whom unarm'd<br/>No strength of man, or fiercest wild beast could withstand;<br/>Who tore the Lion, as the Lion tears the Kid,<br/>Ran on embattelld Armies clad in Iron,<br/>And weaponless himself,<br/>Made Arms ridiculous, useless the forgery<br/>Of brazen shield and spear, the hammer'd Cuirass,<br/>Chalybean temper'd steel, and frock of mail<br/>Adamantean Proof;<br/>But safest he who stood aloof,<br/>When insupportably his foot advanc't,<br/>In scorn of thir proud arms and warlike tools,<br/>Spurn'd them to death by Troops.  The bold Ascalonite<br/>Fled from his Lion ramp, old Warriors turn'd<br/>Thir plated backs under his heel;<br/>Or grovling soild thir crested helmets in the dust.<br/>Then with what trivial weapon came to Hand,<br/>The Jaw of a dead Ass, his sword of bone,<br/>A thousand fore-skins fell, the flower of Palestin<br/>In Ramath-lechi famous to this day:<br/>Then by main force pull'd up, and on his shoulders bore<br/>The Gates of Azza, Post, and massie Bar<br/>Up to the Hill by Hebron, seat of Giants old,<br/>No journey of a Sabbath day, and loaded so;<br/>Like whom the Gentiles feign to bear up Heav'n.<br/>Which shall I first bewail,<br/>Thy Bondage or lost Sight,<br/>Prison within Prison<br/>Inseparably dark?<br/>Thou art become (O worst imprisonment!)<br/>The Dungeon of thy self; thy Soul<br/> (Which Men enjoying sight oft without cause complain)<br/>Imprison'd now indeed,<br/>In real darkness of the body dwells,<br/>Shut up from outward light<br/>To incorporate with gloomy night;<br/>For inward light alas<br/>Puts forth no visual beam.<br/>O mirror of our fickle state,<br/>Since man on earth unparallel'd!<br/>The rarer thy example stands,<br/>By how much from the top of wondrous glory,<br/>Strongest of mortal men,<br/>To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fall'n.<br/>For him I reckon not in high estate<br/>Whom long descent of birth<br/>Or the sphear of fortune raises;<br/>But thee whose strength, while vertue was her mate<br/>Might have subdu'd the Earth,<br/>Universally crown'd with highest praises.<br/><br/>Sam:  I hear the sound of words, thir sense the air<br/>Dissolves unjointed e're it reach my ear.<br/><br/>Chor:  Hee speaks, let us draw nigh.  Matchless in might,<br/>The glory late of Israel, now the grief;<br/>We come thy friends and neighbours not unknown<br/>From Eshtaol and Zora's fruitful Vale<br/>To visit or bewail thee, or if better,<br/>Counsel or Consolation we may bring,<br/>Salve to thy Sores, apt words have power to swage<br/>The tumors of a troubl'd mind,<br/>And are as Balm to fester'd wounds.<br/><br/>Sam:  Your coming, Friends, revives me, for I learn<br/>Now of my own experience, not by talk,<br/>How counterfeit a coin they are who friends<br/>Bear in their Superscription (of the most<br/>I would be understood) in prosperous days<br/>They swarm, but in adverse withdraw their head<br/>Not to be found, though sought.  Wee see, O friends.<br/>How many evils have enclos'd me round;<br/>Yet that which was the worst now least afflicts me,<br/>Blindness, for had I sight, confus'd with shame,<br/>How could I once look up, or heave the head,<br/>Who like a foolish Pilot have shipwrack't,<br/>My Vessel trusted to me from above,<br/>Gloriously rigg'd; and for a word, a tear,<br/>Fool, have divulg'd the secret gift of God<br/>To a deceitful Woman : tell me Friends,<br/>Am I not sung and proverbd for a Fool<br/>In every street, do they not say, how well<br/>Are come upon him his deserts? yet why?<br/>Immeasurable strength they might behold<br/>In me, of wisdom nothing more then mean;<br/>This with the other should, at least, have paird,<br/>These two proportiond ill drove me transverse.<br/><br/>Chor:  Tax not divine disposal, wisest Men<br/>Have err'd, and by bad Women been deceiv'd;<br/>And shall again, pretend they ne're so wise.<br/>Deject not then so overmuch thy self,<br/>Who hast of sorrow thy full load besides;<br/>Yet truth to say, I oft have heard men wonder<br/>Why thou shouldst wed Philistian women rather<br/>Then of thine own Tribe fairer, or as fair,<br/>At least of thy own Nation, and as noble.<br/><br/>Sam:  The first I saw at Timna, and she pleas'd<br/>Mee, not my Parents, that I sought to wed,<br/>The daughter of an Infidel: they knew not<br/>That what I motion'd was of God; I knew<br/>From intimate impulse, and therefore urg'd<br/>The Marriage on; that by occasion hence<br/>I might begin Israel's Deliverance,<br/>The work to which I was divinely call'd;<br/>She proving false, the next I took to Wife<br/>(O that I never had! fond wish too late)<br/>Was in the Vale of Sorec, Dalila,<br/>That specious Monster, my accomplisht snare.<br/>I thought it lawful from my former act,<br/>And the same end; still watching to oppress<br/>Israel's oppressours: of what now I suffer<br/>She was not the prime cause, but I my self,<br/>Who vanquisht with a peal of words (O weakness!)<br/>Gave up my fort of silence to a Woman.<br/><br/>Chor:  In seeking just occasion to provoke<br/>The Philistine, thy Countries Enemy,<br/>Thou never wast remiss, I hear thee witness:<br/>Yet Israel still serves with all his Sons.<br/><br/>Sam:  That fault I take not on me, but transfer<br/>On Israel's Governours, and Heads of Tribes,<br/>Who seeing those great acts which God had done<br/>Singly by me against their Conquerours<br/>Acknowledg'd not, or not at all consider'd<br/>Deliverance offerd : I on th' other side<br/>Us'd no ambition to commend my deeds,<br/>The deeds themselves, though mute, spoke loud the dooer;<br/>But they persisted deaf, and would not seem<br/>To count them things worth notice, till at length<br/>Thir Lords the Philistines with gather'd powers<br/>Enterd Judea seeking mee, who then<br/>Safe to the rock of Etham was retir'd,<br/>Not flying, but fore-casting in what place<br/>To set upon them, what advantag'd best;<br/>Mean while the men of Judah to prevent<br/>The harrass of thir Land, beset me round;<br/>I willingly on some conditions came<br/>Into thir hands, and they as gladly yield me<br/>To the uncircumcis'd a welcom prey,<br/>Bound with two cords; but cords to me were threds<br/>Toucht with the flame: on thir whole Host I flew<br/>Unarm'd, and with a trivial weapon fell'd<br/>Thir choicest youth; they only liv'd who fled.<br/>Had Judah that day join'd, or one whole Tribe,<br/>They had by this possess'd the Towers of Gath,<br/>And lorded over them whom now they serve;<br/>But what more oft in Nations grown corrupt,<br/>And by thir vices brought to servitude,<br/>Then to love Bondage more then Liberty,<br/>Bondage with ease then strenuous liberty;<br/>And to despise, or envy, or suspect<br/>Whom God hath of his special favour rais'd<br/>As thir Deliverer; if he aught begin,<br/>How frequent to desert him, and at last<br/>To heap ingratitude on worthiest deeds?<br/><br/>Chor:  Thy words to my remembrance bring<br/>How Succoth and the Fort of Penuel<br/>Thir great Deliverer contemn'd,<br/>The matchless Gideon in pursuit<br/>Of Madian and her vanquisht Kings;<br/>And how ingrateful Ephraim<br/>Not worse then by his shield and spear<br/>Had dealt with Jephtha, who by argument,<br/>Defended Israel from the Ammonite,<br/>Had not his prowess quell'd thir pride<br/>In that sore battel when so many dy'd<br/>Without Reprieve adjudg'd to death,<br/>For want of well pronouncing Shibboleth.<br/><br/>Sam:  Of such examples adde mee to the roul,<br/>Mee easily indeed mine may neglect,<br/>But Gods propos'd deliverance not so.<br/><br/>Chor: Just are the ways of God,<br/>And justifiable to Men;<br/>Unless there be who think not God at all,<br/>If any be, they walk obscure;<br/>For of such Doctrine never was there School,<br/>But the heart of the Fool,<br/>And no man therein Doctor but himself.<br/>Yet more there be who doubt his ways not just,<br/>As to his own edicts, found contradicting,<br/>Then give the rains to wandring thought,<br/>Regardless of his glories diminution;<br/>Till by thir own perplexities involv'd<br/>They ravel more, still less resolv'd,<br/>But never find self-satisfying solution.<br/>As if they would confine th' interminable,<br/>And tie him to his own prescript,<br/>Who made our Laws to bind us, not himself,<br/>And hath full right to exempt<br/>Whom so it pleases him by choice<br/>From National obstriction, without taint<br/>Of sin, or legal debt;<br/>For with his own Laws he can best dispence.<br/>He would not else who never wanted means,<br/>Nor in respect of the enemy just cause<br/>To set his people free,<br/>Have prompted this Heroic Nazarite,<br/>Against his vow of strictest purity,<br/>To seek in marriage that fallacious Bride,<br/>Unclean, unchaste.<br/>Down Reason then, at least vain reasonings down,<br/>Though Reason here aver<br/>That moral verdit quits her of unclean :<br/>Unchaste was subsequent, her stain not his.<br/>But see here comes thy reverend Sire<br/>With careful step, Locks white as doune,<br/>Old Manoah: advise<br/>Forthwith how thou oughtst to receive him.<br/><br/>Sam:  Ay me, another inward grief awak't,<br/>With mention of that name renews th' assault.<br/><br/>Man:  Brethren and men of Dan, for such ye seem,<br/>Though in this uncouth place; if old respect,<br/>As I suppose, towards your once gloried friend,<br/>My Son now Captive, hither hath inform'd<br/>Your younger feet, while mine cast back with age<br/>Came lagging after; say if he be here.<br/><br/>Chor:  As signal now in low dejected state,<br/>As earst in highest; behold him where be lies.<br/><br/>Man:  O miserable change! is this the man,<br/>That invincible Samson, far renown'd,<br/>The dread of Israel's foes, who with a strength<br/>Equivalent to Angels walk'd thir streets,<br/>None offering fight; who single combatant<br/>Duell'd thir Armies rank't in proud array,<br/>Himself an Army, now unequal match<br/>To save himself against a coward arm'd<br/>At one spears length.  O ever failing trust<br/>In mortal strength! and oh what not in man<br/>Deceivable and vain! Nay what thing good<br/>Pray'd for, but often proves our woe, our bane?<br/>I pray'd for Children, and thought barrenness<br/>In wedlock a reproach; I gain'd a Son,<br/>And such a Son as all Men hail'd me happy;<br/>Who would be now a Father in my stead?<br/>O wherefore did God grant me my request,<br/>And as a blessing with such pomp adorn'd?<br/>Why are his gifts desirable, to tempt<br/>Our earnest Prayers, then giv'n with solemn hand<br/>As Graces, draw a Scorpions tail behind?<br/>For this did the Angel twice descend? for this<br/>Ordain'd thy nurture holy, as of a Plant;<br/>Select, and Sacred, Glorious for a while,<br/>The miracle of men: then in an hour<br/>Ensnar'd, assaulted, overcome, led bound,<br/>Thy Foes derision, Captive, Poor, and Blind<br/>Into a Dungeon thrust, to work with Slaves?<br/>Alas methinks whom God hath chosen once<br/>To worthiest deeds, if he through frailty err,<br/>He should not so o'rewhelm, and as a thrall<br/>Subject him to so foul indignities,<br/>Be it but for honours sake of former deeds.<br/><br/>Sam:  Appoint not heavenly disposition, Father,<br/>Nothing of all these evils hath befall'n me<br/>But justly; I my self have brought them on,<br/>Sole Author I, sole cause: if aught seem vile,<br/>As vile hath been my folly, who have profan'd<br/>The mystery of God giv'n me under pledge<br/>Of vow, and have betray'd it to a woman,<br/>A Canaanite, my faithless enemy.<br/>This well I knew, nor was at all surpris'd,<br/>But warn'd by oft experience: did not she<br/>Of Timna first betray me, and reveal<br/>The secret wrested from me in her highth<br/>Of Nuptial Love profest, carrying it strait<br/>To them who had corrupted her, my Spies,<br/>And Rivals? In this other was there found<br/>More Faith? who also in her prime of love,<br/>Spousal embraces, vitiated with Gold,<br/>Though offer'd only, by the sent conceiv'd<br/>Her spurious first-born; Treason against me?<br/>Thrice she assay'd with flattering prayers and sighs,<br/>And amorous reproaches to win from me<br/>My capital secret, in what part my strength<br/>Lay stor'd in what part summ'd, that she might know:<br/>Thrice I deluded her, and turn'd to sport<br/>Her importunity, each time perceiving<br/>How openly, and with what impudence<br/>She purpos'd to betray me, and (which was worse<br/>Then undissembl'd hate) with what contempt<br/>She sought to make me Traytor to my self;<br/>Yet the fourth time, when mustring all her wiles,<br/>With blandisht parlies, feminine assaults,<br/>Tongue-batteries, she surceas'd not day nor night<br/>To storm me over-watch't, and wearied out.<br/>At times when men seek most repose and rest,<br/>I yielded, and unlock'd her all my heart,<br/>Who with a grain of manhood well resolv'd<br/>Might easily have shook off all her snares :<br/>But foul effeminacy held me yok't<br/>Her Bond-slave; O indignity, O blot<br/>To Honour and Religion! servil mind<br/>Rewarded well with servil punishment!<br/>The base degree to which I now am fall'n,<br/>These rags, this grinding, is not yet so base<br/>As was my former servitude, ignoble,<br/>Unmanly, ignominious, infamous,<br/>True slavery, and that blindness worse then this,<br/>That saw not how degeneratly I serv'd.<br/><br/>Man:  I cannot praise thy Marriage choises, Son,<br/>Rather approv'd them not; but thou didst plead<br/>Divine impulsion prompting how thou might'st<br/>Find some occasion to infest our Foes.<br/>I state not that; this I am sure; our Foes<br/>Found soon occasion thereby to make thee<br/>Thir Captive, and thir triumph; thou the sooner<br/>Temptation found'st, or over-potent charms<br/>To violate the sacred trust of silence<br/>Deposited within thee; which to have kept<br/>Tacit, was in thy power; true; and thou hear'st<br/>Enough, and more the burden of that fault;<br/>Bitterly hast thou paid, and still art paying<br/>That rigid score.  A worse thing yet remains,<br/>This day the Philistines a popular Feast<br/>Here celebrate in Gaza, and proclaim<br/>Great Pomp, and Sacrifice, and Praises loud<br/>To Dagon, as their God who hath deliver'd<br/>Thee Samson bound and blind into thir hands,<br/>Them out of thine, who slew'st them many a slain.<br/>So Dagon shall be magnifi'd, and God,<br/>Besides whom is no God, compar'd with Idols,<br/>Disglorifi'd, blasphem'd, and had in scorn<br/>By th' Idolatrous rout amidst thir wine;<br/>Which to have come to pass by means of thee,<br/>Samson, of all thy sufferings think the heaviest,<br/>Of all reproach the most with shame that ever<br/>Could have befall'n thee and thy Fathers house.<br/><br/>Sam:  Father, I do acknowledge and confess<br/>That I this honour, I this pomp have brought<br/>To Dagon, and advanc'd his praises high<br/>Among the Heathen round; to God have brought<br/>Dishonour, obloquie, and op't the mouths<br/>Of Idolists, and Atheists; have brought scandal<br/>To Israel diffidence of God, and doubt<br/>In feeble hearts, propense anough before<br/>To waver, or fall off and joyn with Idols:<br/>Which is my chief affliction, shame and sorrow,<br/>The anguish of my Soul, that suffers not<br/>Mine eie to harbour sleep, or thoughts to rest.<br/>This only hope relieves me, that the strife<br/>With me hath end; all the contest is now<br/>'Twixt God and Dagon; Dagon hath presum'd,<br/>Me overthrown, to enter lists with God,<br/>His Deity comparing and preferring<br/>Before the God of Abraham. He, he sure,<br/>Will not connive, or linger, thus provok'd,<br/>But will arise and his great name assert:<br/>Dagon must stoop, and shall e're long receive<br/>Such a discomfit, as shall quite despoil him<br/>Of all these boasted Trophies won on me,<br/>And with confusion blank his Worshippers.<br/><br/>Man: With cause this hope relieves thee, and these words<br/>I as a Prophecy receive: for God,<br/>Nothing more certain, will not long defer<br/>To vindicate the glory of his name<br/>Against all competition, nor will long<br/>Endure it, doubtful whether God be Lord,<br/>Or Dagon.  But for thee what shall be done?<br/>Thou must not in the mean while here forgot<br/>Lie in this miserable loathsom plight<br/>Neglected.  I already have made way<br/>To some Philistian Lords, with whom to treat<br/>About thy ransom: well they may by this<br/>Have satisfi'd thir utmost of revenge<br/>By pains and slaveries, worse then death inflicted<br/>On thee, who now no more canst do them harm.<br/><br/>Sam:  Spare that proposal, Father, spare the trouble<br/>Of that sollicitation; let me here,<br/>As I deserve, pay on my punishment;<br/>And expiate, if possible, my crime,<br/>Shameful garrulity.  To have reveal'd<br/>Secrets of men, the secrets of a friend,<br/>How hainous had the fact been, how deserving<br/>Contempt, and scorn of all, to be excluded<br/>All friendship, and avoided as a blab,<br/>The mark of fool set on his front?<br/>But I Gods counsel have not kept, his holy  secret<br/>Presumptuously have publish'd, impiously,<br/>Weakly at least, and shamefully: A sin<br/>That Gentiles in thir Parables condemn<br/>To thir abyss and horrid pains confin'd.<br/><br/>Man:  Be penitent and for thy fault contrite,<br/>But act not in thy own affliction, Son,<br/>Repent the sin, but if the punishment<br/>Thou canst avoid, selfpreservation bids;<br/>Or th' execution leave to high disposal,<br/>And let another hand, not thine, exact<br/>Thy penal forfeit from thy self; perhaps<br/>God will relent, and quit thee all his debt;<br/>Who evermore approves and more accepts<br/>(Best pleas'd with humble and filial submission)<br/>Him who imploring mercy sues for life,<br/>Then who selfrigorous chooses death as due;<br/>Which argues overjust, and self-displeas'd<br/>For self-offence, more then for God offended.<br/>Reject not then what offerd means, who knows<br/>But God hath set before us, to return thee<br/>Home to thy countrey and his sacred house,<br/>Where thou mayst bring thy off'rings, to avert<br/>His further ire, with praiers and vows renew'd.<br/><br/>Sam:  His pardon I implore; but as for life,<br/>To what end should I seek it? when in strength<br/>All mortals I excell'd, and great in hopes<br/>With youthful courage and magnanimous thoughts<br/>Of birth from  Heav'n foretold and high exploits,<br/>Full of divine instinct, after some proof<br/>Of acts indeed heroic, far beyond<br/>The Sons of Anac, famous now and blaz'd,<br/>Fearless of danger, like a petty God<br/>I walk'd about admir'd of all and dreaded<br/>On hostile ground, none daring my affront.<br/>Then swoll'n with pride into the snare I fell<br/>Of fair fallacious looks, venereal trains,<br/>Softn'd with pleasure and voluptuous life;<br/>At length to lay my head and hallow'd pledge<br/>Of all my strength in the lascivious lap<br/>Of a deceitful Concubine who shore me<br/>Like a tame Weather, all my precious fleece,<br/>Then turn'd me out ridiculous, despoil'd,<br/>Shav'n, and disarm'd among my enemies.<br/><br/>Chor.  Desire of wine and all delicious drinks,<br/>Which many a famous Warriour overturns,<br/>Thou couldst repress, nor did the dancing Rubie<br/>Sparkling; out-pow'rd, the flavor, or the smell,<br/>Or taste that cheers the heart of Gods and men,<br/>Allure thee from the cool Crystalline stream.<br/><br/>Sam. Where ever fountain or fresh current flow'd<br/>Against the Eastern ray, translucent, pure,<br/>With touch aetherial of Heav'ns fiery rod<br/>I drank, from the clear milkie juice allaying<br/>Thirst, and refresht; nor envy'd them the grape<br/>Whose heads that turbulent liquor fills with fumes.<br/><br/>Chor.  O madness, to think use of strongest wines<br/>And strongest drinks our chief support of health,<br/>When God with these forbid'n made choice to rear<br/>His mighty Champion, strong above compare,<br/>Whose drink was only from the liquid brook.<br/><br/> Sam.  But what avail'd this temperance, not compleat<br/>Against another object more enticing?<br/>What boots it at one gate to make defence,<br/>And at another to let in the foe<br/>Effeminatly vanquish't? by which means,<br/>Now blind, disheartn'd, sham'd, dishonour'd, quell'd,<br/>To what can I be useful, wherein serve<br/>My Nation, and the work from Heav'n impos'd,<br/>But to sit idle on the houshold hearth,<br/>A burdenous drone; to visitants a gaze,<br/>Or pitied object, these redundant locks<br/>Robustious to no purpose clustring down,<br/>Vain monument of strength; till length of years<br/>And sedentary numness craze my limbs<br/>To a contemptible old age obscure.<br/>Here rather let me drudge and earn my bread,<br/>Till vermin or the draff of servil food<br/>Consume me, and oft-invocated death<br/>Hast'n the welcom end of all my pains.<br/><br/>Man.  Wilt thou then serve the Philistines with that gift<br/>Which was expresly giv'n thee to annoy them?<br/>Better at home lie bed-rid, not only idle,<br/>Inglorious, unimploy'd, with age out-worn.<br/>But God who caus'd a fountain at thy prayer<br/>From the dry ground to spring, thy thirst to allay<br/>After the brunt of battel, can as easie<br/>Cause light again within thy eies to spring,<br/>Wherewith to serve him better then thou hast;<br/>And I perswade me so; why else this strength<br/>Miraculous yet remaining in those locks?<br/>His might continues in thee not for naught,<br/>Nor shall his wondrous gifts be frustrate thus.<br/><br/>Sam:  All otherwise to me my thoughts portend,<br/>That these dark orbs no more shall treat with light,<br/>Nor th' other light of life continue long,<br/>But yield to double darkness nigh at hand:<br/>So much I feel my genial spirits droop,<br/>My hopes all flat, nature within me seems<br/>In all her functions weary of herself;<br/>My race of glory run, and race of shame,<br/>And I shall shortly be with them that rest.<br/><br/>Man.  Believe not these suggestions which proceed<br/>From anguish of the mind and humours black,<br/>That mingle with thy fancy.  I however<br/>Must not omit a Fathers timely care<br/>To prosecute the means of thy deliverance<br/>By ransom or how else: mean while be calm,<br/>And healing words from these thy friends admit.<br/><br/>Sam.  O that torment should not be confin'd<br/>To the bodies wounds and sores<br/>With maladies innumerable<br/>In heart, head, brest, and reins;<br/>But must secret passage find<br/>To th' inmost mind,<br/>There exercise all his fierce accidents,<br/>And on her purest spirits prey,<br/>As on entrails, joints, and limbs,<br/>With answerable pains, but more intense,<br/>'Though void of corporal sense.<br/>My griefs not only pain me<br/>As a lingring disease,<br/>But finding no redress, ferment and rage,<br/>Nor less then wounds immedicable<br/>Ranckle, and fester, and gangrene,<br/>To black mortification.<br/>Thoughts my Tormenters arm'd with deadly stings<br/>Mangle my apprehensive tenderest parts,<br/>Exasperate, exulcerate, and raise<br/>Dire inflammation which no cooling herb<br/>Or rnedcinal liquor can asswage,<br/>Nor breath of Vernal Air from snowy Alp.<br/>Sleep hath forsook and giv'n me o're<br/>To deaths benumming Opium as my only cure.<br/>Thence faintings, swounings of despair,<br/>And sense of Heav'ns desertion.<br/>I was his nursling once and choice delight,<br/>His destin'd from the womb,<br/>Promisd by Heavenly message twice descending.<br/>Under his special eie<br/>Abstemious I grew up and thriv'd amain;<br/>He led me on to mightiest deeds<br/>Above the nerve of mortal arm<br/>Against the uncircumcis'd, our enemies.<br/>But now hath cast me off as never known,<br/>And to those cruel enemies,<br/>Whom I by his appointment had provok't,<br/>Left me all helpless with th' irreparable loss<br/>Of sight, reserv'd alive to be repeated<br/>The subject of thir cruelty, or scorn.<br/>Nor am I in the list of them that hope;<br/>Hopeless are all my evils, all remediless;<br/>This one prayer yet remains, might I be heard,<br/>No long petition, speedy death,<br/>The close of all my miseries, and the balm.<br/><br/>Chor:  Many are the sayings of the wise<br/>In antient and in modern books enroll'd;<br/>Extolling Patience as the truest fortitude;<br/>And to the bearing well of all calamities,<br/>All chances incident to mans frail life<br/>Consolatories writ<br/>With studied argument, and much perswasion sought<br/>Lenient of grief and anxious thought,<br/>But with th' afflicted in his pangs thir sound<br/>Little prevails, or rather seems a tune,<br/>Harsh, and of dissonant mood from his complaint,<br/>Unless he feel within<br/>Some sourse of consolation from above;<br/>Secret refreshings, that repair his strength,<br/>And fainting spirits uphold.<br/>God of our Fathers, what is man!<br/>That thou towards him with hand so various,<br/>Or might I say contrarious,<br/>Temperst thy providence through his short course,<br/>Not evenly, as thou rul'st<br/>The Angelic orders and inferiour creatures mute,<br/>Irrational and brute.<br/>Nor do I name of men the common rout,<br/>That wandring loose about<br/>Grow up and perish, as the summer flie,<br/>Heads without name no more rememberd,<br/>But such as thou hast solemnly elected,<br/>With gifts and graces eminently adorn'd<br/>To some great work, thy glory,<br/>And peoples safety, which in part they effect:<br/>Yet toward these thus dignifi'd, thou oft<br/>Amidst thir highth of noon,<br/>Changest thy countenance, and thy hand with no regard<br/>Of highest favours past<br/>From thee on them, or them to thee of service.<br/>Nor only dost degrade them, or remit<br/>To life obscur'd, which were a fair dismission,<br/>But throw'st them lower then thou didst exalt them high,<br/>Unseemly falls in human eie,<br/>Too grievous for the trespass or omission,<br/>Oft leav'st them to the hostile sword<br/>Of Heathen and prophane, thir carkasses<br/>To dogs and fowls a prey, or else captiv'd:<br/>Or to the unjust tribunals, under change of times,<br/>And condemnation of the ingrateful multitude.<br/>If these they scape, perhaps in poverty<br/>With sickness and disease thou bow'st them down,<br/>Painful diseases and deform'd,<br/>In crude old age;<br/>Though not disordinate, yet causless suffring<br/>The punishment of dissolute days, in fine,<br/>Just or unjust, alike seem miserable,<br/>For oft alike, both come to evil end.<br/>So deal not with this once thy glorious Champion,<br/>The Image of thy strength, and mighty minister.<br/>What do I beg? how hast thou dealt already?<br/>Behold him in this state calamitous, and turn<br/>His labours, for thou canst, to peaceful end.<br/>But who is this, what thing of Sea or Land?<br/>Femal of sex it seems,<br/>That so bedeckt, ornate, and gay,<br/>Comes this way sailing<br/>Like a stately Ship<br/>Of Tarsus, bound for th' Isles<br/>Of Javan or Gadier<br/>With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,<br/>Sails fill'd, and streamers waving,<br/>Courted by all the winds that hold them play,<br/>An Amber sent of odorous perfume<br/>Her harbinger, a damsel train behind;<br/>Some rich Philistian Matron she may seem,<br/>And now at nearer view, no other certain<br/>Than Dalila thy wife.<br/><br/>Sam:  My Wife, my Traytress, let her not come near me.<br/><br/>Cho:  Yet on she moves, now stands & eies thee fixt,<br/>About t'have spoke, but now, with head declin'd<br/>Like a fair flower surcharg'd with dew, she weeps<br/>And words addrest seem into tears dissolv'd,<br/>Wetting the borders of her silk'n veil:<br/>But now again she makes address to speak.<br/><br/>Dal:  With doubtful feet and wavering resolution<br/>I came, still dreading thy displeasure, Samson,<br/>Which to have merited, without excuse,<br/>I cannot but acknowledge; yet if tears<br/>May expiate (though the fact more evil drew<br/>In the perverse event then I foresaw)<br/>My penance hath not slack'n'd, though my pardon<br/>No way assur'd.

I saw thee mutable<br/>Of fancy, feard lest one day thou wouldst leave me<br/>As her at Timna, sought by all means therefore<br/>How to endear, and hold thee to me firmest:<br/>No better way I saw then by importuning<br/>To learn thy secrets, get into my power<br/>Thy key of strength and safety: thou wilt say,<br/>Why then reveal'd? I was assur'd by those<br/>Who tempted me, that nothing was design'd<br/>Against thee but safe custody, and hold:<br/>That made for me, I knew that liberty<br/>Would draw thee forth to perilous enterprises,<br/>While I at home sate full of cares and fears<br/>Wailing thy absence in my widow'd bed;<br/>Here I should still enjoy thee day and night<br/>Mine and Loves prisoner, not the Philistines,<br/>Whole to my self, unhazarded abroad,<br/>Fearless at home of partners in my love.<br/>These reasons in Loves law have past for good,<br/>Though fond and reasonless to some perhaps:<br/>And Love hath oft, well meaning, wrought much wo,<br/>Yet always pity or pardon hath obtain'd.<br/>Be not unlike all others, not austere<br/>As thou art strong, inflexible as steel.<br/>If thou in strength all mortals dost exceed,<br/>In uncompassionate anger do not so.<br/><br/>Sam:  How cunningly the sorceress displays<br/>Her own transgressions, to upbraid me mine!<br/>That malice not repentance brought thee hither,<br/>By this appears : I gave, thou say'st, th' example,<br/>I led the way; bitter reproach, but true,<br/>I to my self was false e're thou to me,<br/>Such pardon therefore as I give my folly,<br/>Take to thy wicked deed: which when thou seest<br/>Impartial, self-severe, inexorable,<br/>Thou wilt renounce thy seeking, and much rather<br/>Confess it feign'd, weakness is thy excuse,<br/>And I believe it, weakness to resist<br/>Philistian gold: if weakness may excuse,<br/>What Murtherer, what Traytor, Parricide,<br/>Incestuous, Sacrilegious, but may plead it?<br/>All wickedness is weakness : that plea therefore<br/>With God or Man will gain thee no remission.<br/>But Love constrain'd thee; call it furious rage<br/>To satisfie thy lust: Love seeks to have Love;<br/>My love how couldst thou hope, who tookst the way<br/>To raise in me inexpiable hate,<br/>Knowing, as needs I must, by thee betray'd ?<br/>In vain thou striv'st to cover shame with shame,<br/>Or by evasions thy crime uncoverst more.<br/><br/>Dal:  Since thou determinst weakness for no plea<br/>In man or woman, though to thy own condemning,<br/>Hear what assaults I had, what snares besides,<br/>What sieges girt me round, e're I consented;<br/>Which might have aw'd the best resolv'd of men,<br/>The constantest to have yielded without blame.<br/>It was not gold, as to my charge thou lay'st,<br/>That wrought with me: thou know'st the Magistrates<br/>And Princes of my countrey came in person,<br/>Sollicited, commanded, threatn'd, urg'd,<br/>Adjur'd by all the bonds of civil Duty<br/>And of Religion, press'd how just it was,<br/>How honourable, how glorious to entrap<br/>A common enemy, who had destroy'd<br/>Such numbers of our Nation : and the Priest<br/>Was not behind, but ever at my ear,<br/>Preaching how meritorious with the gods<br/>It would be to ensnare an irreligious<br/>Dishonourer of Dagon : what had I<br/>To oppose against such powerful arguments?<br/>Only my love of thee held long debate;<br/>And combated in silence all these reasons<br/>With hard contest: at length that grounded maxim<br/>So rife and celebrated in the mouths<br/>Of wisest men; that to the public good<br/>Private respects must yield; with grave authority'<br/>Took full possession of me and prevail'd;<br/>Vertue, as I thought, truth, duty so enjoyning.<br/><br/>Sam:  I thought where all thy circling wiles would end;<br/>In feign'd Religion, smooth hypocrisie.<br/>But had thy love, still odiously pretended,<br/>Bin, as it ought, sincere, it would have taught thee<br/>Far other reasonings, brought forth other deeds.<br/>I before all the daughters of my Tribe<br/>And of my Nation chose thee from among<br/>My enemies, lov'd thee, as too well thou knew'st,<br/>Too well, unbosom'd all my secrets to thee,<br/>Not out of levity, but over-powr'd<br/>By thy request, who could deny thee nothing;<br/>Yet now am judg'd an enemy.  Why then<br/>Didst thou at first receive me for thy husband?<br/>Then, as since then, thy countries foe profest:<br/>Being once a wife, for me thou wast to leave<br/>Parents and countrey; nor was I their subject,<br/>Nor under their protection but my own,<br/>Thou mine, not theirs: if aught against my life<br/>Thy countrey sought of thee, it sought unjustly,<br/>Against the law of nature, law of nations,<br/>No more thy countrey, but an impious crew<br/>Of men conspiring to uphold thir state<br/>By worse than hostile deeds, violating the ends<br/>For which our countrey is a name so dear;<br/>Not therefore to be obey'd.  But zeal mov'd thee;<br/>To please thy gods thou didst it; gods unable<br/>To acquit themselves and prosecute their foes<br/>But by ungodly deeds, the contradiction<br/>Of their own deity, Gods cannot be:<br/>Less therefore to be pleas'd, obey'd, or fear'd,<br/>These false pretexts and varnish'd colours failing,<br/>Bare in thy guilt how foul must thou appear?<br/><br/>Dal:  In argument with men a woman ever<br/>Goes by the worse, whatever be her cause.<br/><br/>Sam:  For want of words no doubt, or lack of breath,<br/>Witness when I was worried with thy peals.<br/><br/>Dal:  I was a fool, too rash, and quite mistaken<br/>In what I thought would have succeeded best.<br/>Let me obtain forgiveness of thee, Samson,<br/>Afford me place to shew what recompence<br/>Towards thee I intend for what I have misdone,<br/>Misguided: only what remains past cure<br/>Bear not too sensibly, nor still insist<br/>To afflict thy self in vain: though sight be lost,<br/>Life yet hath many solaces, enjoy'd<br/>Where other senses want not their delights<br/>At home in leisure and domestic ease,<br/>Exempt from many a care and chance to which<br/>Eye-sight exposes daily men abroad.<br/>I to the Lords will intercede, not doubting<br/>Thir favourable ear, that I may fetch thee<br/>From forth this loathsom prison-house, to abide<br/>With me, where my redoubl'd love and care<br/>With nursing diligence, to me glad office,<br/>May ever tend about thee to old age<br/>With all things grateful chear'd, and so suppli'd,<br/>That what by me thou hast lost thou least shalt miss.<br/><br/>Sam:  No, no, of my condition take no care;<br/>It fits not; thou and I long since are twain;<br/>Nor think me so unwary or accurst<br/>To bring my feet again into the snare<br/>Where once I have been caught; I know thy trains<br/>Though dearly to my cost, thy ginns, and toyls;<br/>Thy fair enchanted cup, and warbling charms<br/>No more on me have power, their force is null'd,<br/>So much of Adders wisdom I have learn't<br/>To fence my ear against thy sorceries.<br/>If in my flower of youth and strength, when all men<br/>Lov'd, honour'd, fear'd me, thou alone could hate me<br/>Thy Husband, slight me, sell me, and forgo me;<br/>How wouldst thou use me now, blind, and thereby<br/>Deceiveable, in most things as a child<br/>Helpless, thence easily contemn'd, and scorn'd,<br/>And last neglected? How wouldst thou insult<br/>When I must live uxorious to thy will<br/>In perfet thraldom, how again betray me,<br/>Bearing my words and doings to the Lords<br/>To gloss upon, and censuring, frown or smile?<br/>This Gaol I count the house of Liberty<br/>To thine whose doors my feet shall never enter.<br/><br/>Dal:  Let me approach at least, and touch thy hand.<br/><br/>Sam:  Not for thy life, lest fierce remembrance wake<br/>My sudden rage to tear thee joint by joint.<br/>At distance I forgive thee, go with that;<br/>Bewail thy falshood, and the pious works<br/>It hath brought forth to make thee memorable<br/>Among illustrious women, faithful wives:<br/>Cherish thy hast'n'd widowhood with the gold<br/>Of Matrimonial treason: so farewel.<br/><br/>Dal:  I see thou art implacable, more deaf<br/>To prayers, then winds and seas, yet winds to seas<br/>Are reconcil'd at length, and Sea to Shore:<br/>Thy anger, unappeasable, still rages,<br/>Eternal tempest never to be calm'd.<br/>Why do I humble thus my self, and suing<br/>For peace, reap nothing but repulse and hate?<br/>Bid go with evil omen and the brand<br/>Of infamy upon my name denounc't?<br/>To mix with thy concernments I desist<br/>Henceforth, nor too much disapprove my own.<br/>Fame if not double-fac't is double-mouth'd,<br/>And with contrary blast proclaims most deeds,<br/>On both his wings, one black, th' other white,<br/>Bears greatest names in his wild aerie flight.<br/>My name perhaps among the Circumcis'd<br/>In Dan, in Judah, and the bordering Tribes,<br/>To all posterity may stand defam'd,<br/>With malediction mention'd, and the blot<br/>Of falshood most unconjugal traduc't.<br/>But in my countrey where I most desire,<br/>In Ecron, Gaza, Asdod, and in Gath<br/>I shall be nam'd among the famousest<br/>Of Women, sung at solemn festivals,<br/>Living and dead recorded, who to save<br/>Her countrey from a fierce destroyer, chose<br/>Above the faith of wedlock-bands, my tomb<br/>With odours visited and annual flowers.<br/>Not less renown'd then in Mount Ephraim,<br/>Jael who with inhospitable guile<br/>Smote Sisera sleeping through the Temples nail'd.<br/>Nor shall I count it hainous to enjoy<br/>The public marks of honour and reward<br/>Conferr'd upon me, for the piety<br/>Which to my countrey I was judg'd to have shewn.<br/>At this who ever envies or repines<br/>I leave him to his lot, and like my own.<br/><br/>Chor:  She's gone, a manifest Serpent by her sting<br/>Discover'd in the end, till now conceal'd.<br/><br/>Sam:  So let her go, God sent her to debase me,<br/>And aggravate my folly who committed<br/>To such a viper his most sacred trust<br/>Of secresie, my safety, and my life.<br/><br/>Chor:  Yet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power,<br/>After offence returning, to regain<br/>Love once possest, nor can be easily<br/>Repuls't, without much inward passion felt<br/>And secret sting of amorous remorse.<br/><br/>Sam:  Love-quarrels oft in pleasing concord end,<br/>Not wedlock-trechery endangering life.<br/><br/>Chor:  It is not vertue, wisdom, valour, wit,<br/>Strength, comliness of shape, or amplest merit<br/>That womans love can win or long inherit;<br/>But what it is, hard is to say,<br/>Harder to hit,<br/>(Which way soever men refer it)<br/>Much like thy riddle, Samson, in one day<br/>Or seven, though one should musing sit;<br/>If any of these or all, the Timnian bride<br/>Had not so soon preferr'd<br/>Thy Paranymph, worthless to thee compar'd,<br/>Successour in thy bed,<br/>Nor both so loosly disally'd<br/>Thir nuptials, nor this last so trecherously<br/>Had shorn the fatal harvest of thy head.<br/>Is it for that such outward ornament<br/>Was lavish't on thir Sex, that inward gifts<br/>Were left for hast unfinish't, judgment scant,<br/>Capacity not rais'd to apprehend<br/>Or value what is best<br/>In choice, but oftest to affect the wrong?<br/>Or was too much of self-love mixt,<br/>Of constancy no root infixt,<br/>That either they love nothing, or not long?<br/>What e're it be, to wisest men and best<br/>Seeming at first all heavenly under virgin veil,<br/>Soft, modest, meek, demure,<br/>Once join'd, the contrary she proves, a thorn<br/>Intestin, far within defensive arms<br/>A cleaving mischief, in his way to vertue<br/>Adverse and turbulent, or by her charms<br/>Draws him awry enslav'd<br/>With dotage, and his sense deprav'd<br/>To folly and shameful deeds which ruin ends.<br/>What Pilot so expert but needs must wreck<br/>Embarqu'd with such a Stears-mate at the Helm?<br/>Favour'd of Heav'n who finds<br/>One vertuous rarely found,<br/>That in domestic good combines:<br/>Happy that house! his way to peace is smooth:<br/>But vertue which breaks through all opposition,<br/>And all temptation can remove,<br/>Most shines and most is acceptable above.<br/>Therefore Gods universal Law<br/>Gave to the man despotic power<br/>Over his female in due awe,<br/>Nor from that right to part an hour,<br/>Smile she or lowre:<br/>So shall he least confusion draw<br/>On his whole life, not sway'd<br/>By female usurpation, nor dismay'd.<br/>But had we best retire, I see a storm?<br/><br/>Sam:  Fair days have oft contracted wind and rain.<br/><br/>Chor:  But this another kind of tempest brings.<br/><br/>Sam:  Be less abstruse, my riddling days are past.<br/><br/>Chor:  Look now for no inchanting voice, nor fear<br/>The bait of honied words; a rougher tongue<br/>Draws hitherward, I know him by his stride,<br/>The Giant Harapha of Gath, his look<br/>Haughty as is his pile high-built and proud.<br/>Comes he in peace? what wind hath blown him hither<br/>I less conjecture then when first I saw<br/>The sumptuous Dalila floating this way:<br/>His habit carries peace, his brow defiance.<br/><br/>Sam:  Or peace or not, alike to me he comes.<br/><br/>Chor:  His fraught we soon shall know, he now arrives.<br/><br/>Har:  I come not Samson, to condole thy chance,<br/>As these perhaps, yet wish it had not been,<br/>Though for no friendly intent.

Much I have heard<br/>Of thy prodigious might and feats perform'd<br/>Incredible to me, in this displeas'd,<br/>That I was never present on the place<br/>Of those encounters, where we might have tri'd<br/>Each others force in camp or listed field:<br/>And now am come to see of whom such noise<br/>Hath walk'd about, and each limb to survey,<br/>If thy appearance answer loud report.<br/><br/>Sam:  The way to know were not to see but taste.<br/><br/>Har:  Dost thou already single me; I thought<br/>Gives and the Mill had tam'd thee? O that fortune<br/>Had brought me to the field where thou art fam'd<br/>To have wrought such wonders with an Asses Jaw;<br/>I should have forc'd thee soon with other arms,<br/>Or left thy carkass where the Ass lay thrown:<br/>So had the glory of Prowess been recover'd<br/>To Palestine, won by a Philistine<br/>From the unforeskinn'd race, of whom thou hear'st<br/>The highest name for valiant Acts, that honour<br/>Certain to have won by mortal duel from thee,<br/>I lose, prevented by thy eyes put out.<br/><br/>Sam:  Boast not of what thou wouldst have done, but do<br/>What then thou would'st, thou seest it in thy hand.<br/><br/>Har:  To combat with a blind man I disdain<br/>And thou hast need much washing to be toucht.<br/><br/>Sam:  Such usage as your honourable Lords<br/>Afford me assassinated and betray'd,<br/>Who durst not with thir whole united powers<br/>In fight withstand me single and unarm'd,<br/>Nor in the house with chamber Ambushes<br/>Close-banded durst attaque me, no not sleeping,<br/>Till they had hir'd a woman with their gold<br/>Breaking her Marriage Faith to circumvent me.<br/>Therefore without feign'd shifts let be assign'd<br/>Some narrow place enclos'd, where sight may give thee.<br/>Or rather flight, no great advantage on me;<br/>Then put on all thy gorgeous arms, thy Helmet<br/>And Brigandine of brass, thy broad Habergeon.<br/>Vant-brass and Greves, and Gauntlet, add thy Spear<br/>A Weavers beam, and seven-times-folded shield.<br/>I only with an Oak'n staff will meet thee,<br/>And raise such out-cries on thy clatter'd Iron,<br/>Which long shall not with-hold mee from thy head,<br/>That in a little time while breath remains thee,<br/>Thou oft shalt wish thy self at Gath to boast<br/>Again in safety what thou wouldst have done<br/>To Samson, but shalt never see Gath more.<br/><br/>Har: Thou durst not thus disparage glorious arms<br/>Which greatest Heroes have in battel worn,<br/>Thir ornament and safety, had not spells<br/>And black enchantments, some Magicians Art<br/>Arm'd thee or charm'd thee strong, which thou from Heaven<br/>Feigndst at thy birth was giv'n thee in thy hair,<br/>Where strength can least abide, though all thy hairs<br/>Were bristles rang'd like those that ridge the back<br/>Of chaf't wild Boars, or ruffl'd Porcupines.<br/><br/>Sam:  I know no Spells, use no forbidden Arts;<br/>My trust is in the living God who gave me<br/>At my Nativity this strength, diffus'd<br/>No less through all my sinews, joints and bones,<br/>Then thine, while I preserv'd these locks unshorn,<br/>The pledge of my unviolated vow.<br/>For proof hereof, if Dagon be thy god,<br/>Go to his Temple, invocate his aid<br/>With solemnest devotion, spread before him<br/>How highly it concerns his glory now<br/>To frustrate and dissolve these Magic spells,<br/>Which I to be the power of Israel's God<br/>Avow, and challenge Dagon to the test,<br/>Offering to combat thee his Champion bold,<br/>With th' utmost of his Godhead seconded:<br/>Then thou shalt see, or rather to thy sorrow<br/>Soon feel, whose God is strongest, thine or mine.<br/><br/>Har:  Presume not on thy God, what e're he be,<br/>Thee he regards not, owns not, hath cut off<br/>Quite from his people, and delivered up<br/>Into thy Enemies hand, permitted them<br/>To put out both thine eyes, and fetter'd send thee<br/>Into the common Prison, there to grind<br/>Among the Slaves and Asses thy comrades,<br/>As good for nothing else, no better service<br/>With those, thy boyst'rous locks, no worthy match<br/>For valour to assail, nor by the sword<br/>Of noble Warriour, so to stain his honour,<br/>But by the Barbers razor best subdu'd.<br/><br/>Sam:  All these indignities, for such they are<br/>From thine, these evils I deserve and more,<br/>Acknowledge them from God inflicted on me<br/>Justly, yet despair not of his final pardon<br/>Whose ear is ever open; and his eye<br/>Gracious to re-admit the suppliant;<br/>In confidence whereof I once again<br/>Defie thee to the trial of mortal fight,<br/>By combat to decide whose god is God,<br/>Thine or whom I with Israel's Sons adore.<br/><br/>Har:  Fair honour that thou dost thy God, in trusting<br/>He will accept thee to defend his cause,<br/>A Murtherer, a Revolter, and a Robber.<br/><br/>Sam: Tongue-doubtie Giant, how dost thou prove me these?<br/><br/>Har:  Is not thy Nation subject to our Lords?<br/>Thir Magistrates confest it, when they took thee<br/>As a League-breaker and deliver'd bound<br/>Into our hands: for hadst thou not committed<br/>Notorious murder on those thirty men<br/>At Askalon, who never did thee harm,<br/>Then like a Robber stripdst them of thir robes?<br/>The Philistines, when thou hadst broke the league,<br/>Went up with armed powers thee only seeking,<br/>To others did no violence nor spoil.<br/><br/>Sam:  Among the Daughters of the Philistines<br/>I chose a Wife, which argu'd me no foe;<br/>And in your City held my Nuptial Feast:<br/>But your ill-meaning Politician Lords,<br/>Under pretence of Bridal friends and guests,<br/>Appointed to await me thirty spies,<br/>Who threatning cruel death constrain'd the bride<br/>To wring from me and tell to them my secret,<br/>That solv'd the riddle which I had propos'd.<br/>When I perceiv'd all set on enmity,<br/>As on my enemies, where ever chanc'd,<br/>I us'd hostility, and took thir spoil<br/>To pay my underminers in thir coin.<br/>My Nation was subjected to your Lords.<br/>It was the force of Conquest; force with force<br/>Is well ejected when the Conquer'd can.<br/>But I a private person, whom my Countrey<br/>As a league-breaker gave up bound, presum'd<br/>Single Rebellion and did Hostile Acts.<br/>I was no private but a person rais'd<br/>With strength sufficient and command from Heav'n<br/>To free my Countrey; if their servile minds<br/>Me their Deliverer sent would not receive,<br/>But to thir Masters gave me up for nought,<br/>Th' unworthier they; whence to this day they serve.<br/>I was to do my part from Heav'n assign'd,<br/>And had perform'd it if my known offence<br/>Had not disabl'd me, not all your force:<br/>These shifts refuted, answer thy appellant<br/>Though by his blindness maim'd for high attempts,<br/>Who now defies thee thrice to single fight,<br/>As a petty enterprise of small enforce.<br/><br/>Har:  With thee a Man condemn'd, a Slave enrol'd,<br/>Due by the Law to capital punishment?<br/>To fight with thee no man of arms will deign.<br/><br/>Sam:  Cam'st thou for this, vain boaster, to survey me,<br/>To descant on my strength, and give thy verdit?<br/>Come nearer, part not hence so slight inform'd;<br/>But take good heed my hand survey not thee.<br/>Har:  O Baal-zebub! can my ears unus'd<br/>Hear these dishonours, and not render death?<br/><br/>Sam:  No man with-holds thee, nothing from thy hand<br/>Fear I incurable; bring up thy van,<br/>My heels are fetter'd, but my fist is free.<br/><br/>Har:  This insolence other kind of answer fits.<br/><br/>Sam:  Go baffl'd coward, lest I run upon thee,<br/>Though in these chains, bulk without spirit vast,<br/>And with one buffet lay thy structure low,<br/>Or swing thee in the Air, then dash thee down<br/>To the hazard of thy brains and shatter'd sides.<br/><br/>Har:  By Astaroth e're long thou shalt lament<br/>These braveries in Irons loaden on thee.<br/><br/>Chor:  His Giantship is gone somewhat crestfall'n,<br/>Stalking with less unconsci'nable strides,<br/>And lower looks, but in a sultrie chafe.<br/><br/>Sam: I dread him not, nor all his Giant-brood,<br/>Though Fame divulge him Father of five Sons<br/>All of Gigantic size, Goliah chief.<br/><br/>Chor:  He will directly to the Lords, I fear,<br/>And with malitious counsel stir them up<br/>Some way or other yet further to afflict thee.<br/><br/>Sam:  He must allege some cause, and offer'd fight<br/>Will not dare mention, lest a question rise<br/>Whether he durst accept the offer or not,<br/>And that he durst not plain enough appear'd.<br/>Much more affliction then already felt<br/>They cannot well impose, nor I sustain;<br/>If they intend advantage of my labours<br/>The work of many hands, which earns my keeping<br/>With no small profit daily to my owners.<br/>But come what will, my deadliest foe will prove<br/>My speediest friend, by death to rid me hence,<br/>The worst that he can give, to me the best.<br/>Yet so it may fall out, because thir end<br/>Is hate, not help to me, it may with mine<br/>Draw thir own ruin who attempt the deed.<br/><br/>Chor:  Oh how comely it is and how reviving<br/>To the Spirits of just men long opprest!<br/>When God into the hands of thir deliverer<br/>Puts invincible might<br/>To quell the mighty of the Earth, th' oppressour,<br/>The brute and boist'rous force of violent men<br/>Hardy and industrious to support<br/>Tyrannic power, but raging to pursue<br/>The righteous and all such as honour Truth;<br/>He all thir Ammunition<br/>And feats of War defeats<br/>With plain Heroic magnitude of mind<br/>And celestial vigour arm'd,<br/>Thir Armories and Magazins contemns,<br/>Renders them useless, while<br/>With winged expedition<br/>Swift as the lightning glance he executes<br/>His errand on the wicked, who surpris'd<br/>Lose thir defence distracted and amaz'd.<br/>But patience is more oft the exercise<br/>Of Saints, the trial of thir fortitude,<br/>Making them each his own Deliverer,<br/>And Victor over all<br/>That tyrannie or fortune can inflict,<br/>Either of these is in thy lot,<br/>Samson, with might endu'd<br/>Above the Sons of men;
