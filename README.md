  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To Harriet by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    It is not blasphemy to hope that Heaven<br/>More perfectly will give those nameless joys<br/>Which throb within the pulses of the blood<br/>And sweeten all that bitterness which Earth<br/>Infuses in the heaven-born soul. O thou<br/>Whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy path<br/>Which this lone spirit travelled, drear and cold,<br/>Yet swiftly leading to those awful limits<br/>Which mark the bounds of Time and of the space<br/>When Time shall be no more; wilt thou not turn<br/>Those spirit-beaming eyes and look on me,<br/>Until I be assured that Earth is Heaven,<br/>And Heaven is Earth?--will not thy glowing cheek,<br/>Glowing with soft suffusion, rest on mine,<br/>And breathe magnetic sweetness through the frame<br/>Of my corporeal nature, through the soul<br/>Now knit with these fine fibres? I would give<br/>The longest and the happiest day that fate<br/>Has marked on my existence but to feel<br/>ONE soul-reviving kiss...O thou most dear,<br/>'Tis an assurance that this Earth is Heaven,<br/>And Heaven the flower of that untainted seed<br/>Which springeth here beneath such love as ours.<br/>Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve,<br/>But ours shall not be mortal! The cold hand<br/>Of Time may chill the love of earthly minds<br/>Half frozen now; the frigid intercourse<br/>Of common souls lives but a summer's day;<br/>It dies, where it arose, upon this earth.<br/>But ours! oh, 'tis the stretch of Fancy's hope<br/>To portray its continuance as now,<br/>Warm, tranquil, spirit-healing; nor when age<br/>Has tempered these wild ecstasies, and given<br/>A soberer tinge to the luxurious glow<br/>Which blazing on devotion's pinnacle<br/>Makes virtuous passion supersede the power<br/>Of reason; nor when life's aestival sun<br/>To deeper manhood shall have ripened me;<br/>Nor when some years have added judgement's store<br/>To all thy woman sweetness, all the fire<br/>Which throbs in thine enthusiast heart; not then<br/>Shall holy friendship (for what other name<br/>May love like ours assume?), not even then<br/>Shall Custom so corrupt, or the cold forms<br/>Of this desolate world so harden us,<br/>As when we think of the dear love that binds<br/>Our souls in soft communion, while we know<br/>Each other's thoughts and feelings, can we say<br/>Unblushingly a heartless compliment,<br/>Praise, hate, or love with the unthinking world,<br/>Or dare to cut the unrelaxing nerve<br/>That knits our love to virtue. Can those eyes,<br/>Beaming with mildest radiance on my heart<br/>To purify its purity, e'er bend<br/>To soothe its vice or consecrate its fears?<br/>Never, thou second Self! Is confidence<br/>So vain in virtue that I learn to doubt<br/>The mirror even of Truth? Dark flood of Time,<br/>Roll as it listeth thee; I measure not<br/>By month or moments thy ambiguous course.<br/>Another may stand by me on thy brink,,<br/>And watch the bubble whirled beyond his ken,<br/>Which pauses at my feet. The sense of love,<br/>The thirst for action, and the impassioned thought<br/>Prolong my being; if I wake no more,<br/>My life more actual living will contain<br/>Than some gray veteran's of the world's cold school,<br/>Whose listless hours unprofitably roll<br/>By one enthusiast feeling unredeemed,<br/>Virtue and Love! unbending Fortitude,<br/>Freedom, Devotedness and Purity!<br/>That life my Spirit consecrates to you.
