Pyth. x.<br/><br/>DEDICATION.<br/><br/>There is no danger to a man that knows<br/>What life and death is: there's not any law<br/>Exceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful<br/>That he should stoop to any other law.--CHAPMAN.<br/><br/>TO MARY -- --.<br/><br/>So now my summer-task is ended, Mary,<br/>And I return to thee, mine own heart's home;<br/>As to his Queen some victor Knight of Faery,<br/>Earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome;<br/>Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become<br/>A star among the stars of mortal night,<br/>If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom,<br/>Its doubtful promise thus I would unite<br/>With thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.<br/><br/>The toil which stole from thee so many an hour,<br/>Is ended,--and the fruit is at thy feet!<br/>No longer where the woods to frame a bower<br/>With interlaced branches mix and meet,<br/>Or where with sound like many voices sweet,<br/>Waterfalls leap among wild islands green,<br/>Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat<br/>Of moss-grown trees and weeds, shall I be seen;<br/>But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.<br/><br/>Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear Friend, when first<br/>The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.<br/>I do remember well the hour which burst<br/>My spirit's sleep. A fresh May-dawn it was,<br/>When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,<br/>And wept, I knew not why; until there rose<br/>From the near schoolroom, voices that, alas!<br/>Were but one echo from a world of woes--<br/>The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.<br/><br/>And then I clasped my hands and looked around--<br/>--But none was near to mock my streaming eyes,<br/>Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground--<br/>So without shame I spake:--'I will be wise,<br/>And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies<br/>Such power, for I grow weary to behold<br/>The selfish and the strong still tyrannise<br/>Without reproach or check.' I then controlled<br/>My tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.<br/><br/>And from that hour did I with earnest thought<br/>Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore;<br/>Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught<br/>I cared to learn, but from that secret store<br/>Wrought linked armour for my soul, before<br/>It might walk forth to war among mankind;<br/>Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more<br/>Within me, till there came upon my mind<br/>A sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined.<br/><br/>Alas, that love should be a blight and snare<br/>To those who seek all sympathies in one!--<br/>Such once I sought in vain; then black despair,<br/>The shadow of a starless night, was thrown<br/>Over the world in which I moved alone:--<br/>Yet never found I one not false to me,<br/>Hard hearts, and cold, like weights of icy stone<br/>Which crushed and withered mine, that could not be<br/>Aught but a lifeless clod, until revived by thee.<br/><br/>Thou Friend, whose presence on my wintry heart<br/>Fell, like bright Spring upon some herbless plain;<br/>How beautiful and calm and free thou wert<br/>In thy young wisdom, when the mortal chain<br/>Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,<br/>And walked as free as light the clouds among,<br/>Which many an envious slave then breathed in vain<br/>From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprung<br/>To meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long!<br/><br/>No more alone through the world's wilderness,<br/>Although I trod the paths of high intent,<br/>I journeyed now: no more companionless,<br/>Where solitude is like despair, I went.--<br/>There is the wisdom of a stern content<br/>When Poverty can blight the just and good,<br/>When Infamy dares mock the innocent,<br/>And cherished friends turn with the multitude<br/>To trample: this was ours, and we unshaken stood!<br/><br/>Now has descended a serener hour,<br/>And with inconstant fortune, friends return;<br/>Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power<br/>Which says:--Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.<br/>And from thy side two gentle babes are born<br/>To fill our home with smiles, and thus are we<br/>Most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn;<br/>And these delights, and thou, have been to me<br/>The parents of the Song I consecrate to thee.<br/><br/>Is it that now my inexperienced fingers<br/>But strike the prelude of a loftier strain?<br/>Or, must the lyre on which my spirit lingers<br/>Soon pause in silence, ne'er to sound again,<br/>Though it might shake the Anarch Custom's reign,<br/>And charm the minds of men to Truth's own sway<br/>Holier than was Amphion's? I would fain<br/>Reply in hope--but I am worn away,<br/>And Death and Love are yet contending for their prey.<br/><br/>And what art thou? I know, but dare not speak:<br/>Time may interpret to his silent years.<br/>Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek,<br/>And in the light thine ample forehead wears,<br/>And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears,<br/>And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy<br/>Is whispered, to subdue my fondest fears:<br/>And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I see<br/>A lamp of vestal fire burning internally.<br/><br/>They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth,<br/>Of glorious parents thou aspiring Child.<br/>I wonder not--for One then left this earth<br/>Whose life was like a setting planet mild,<br/>Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled<br/>Of its departing glory; still her fame<br/>Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild<br/>Which shake these latter days; and thou canst claim<br/>The shelter, from thy Sire, of an immortal name.<br/><br/>One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit,<br/>Which was the echo of three thousand years;<br/>And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it,<br/>As some lone man who in a desert hears<br/>The music of his home:--unwonted fears<br/>Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,<br/>And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,<br/>Like thunder-stricken dragons, for a space<br/>Left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.<br/><br/>Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!<br/>If there must be no response to my cry--<br/>If men must rise and stamp with fury blind<br/>On his pure name who loves them,--thou and I,<br/>Sweet friend! can look from our tranquillity<br/>Like lamps into the world's tempestuous night,--<br/>Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by<br/>Which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight,<br/>That burn from year to year with unextinguished light.<br/><br/>CANTO 1.<br/><br/>When the last hope of trampled France had failed<br/>Like a brief dream of unremaining glory,<br/>From visions of despair I rose, and scaled<br/>The peak of an aerial promontory,<br/>Whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary;<br/>And saw the golden dawn break forth, and waken<br/>Each cloud, and every wave:--but transitory<br/>The calm; for sudden, the firm earth was shaken,<br/>As if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken.<br/><br/>So as I stood, one blast of muttering thunder<br/>Burst in far peals along the waveless deep,<br/>When, gathering fast, around, above, and under,<br/>Long trains of tremulous mist began to creep,<br/>Until their complicating lines did steep<br/>The orient sun in shadow:--not a sound<br/>Was heard; one horrible repose did keep<br/>The forests and the floods, and all around<br/>Darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground.<br/><br/>Hark! 'tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps<br/>Earth and the ocean. See! the lightnings yawn<br/>Deluging Heaven with fire, and the lashed deeps<br/>Glitter and boil beneath: it rages on,<br/>One mighty stream, whirlwind and waves upthrown,<br/>Lightning, and hail, and darkness eddying by.<br/>There is a pause--the sea-birds, that were gone<br/>Into their caves to shriek, come forth, to spy<br/>What calm has fall'n on earth, what light is in the sky.<br/><br/>For, where the irresistible storm had cloven<br/>That fearful darkness, the blue sky was seen<br/>Fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven<br/>Most delicately, and the ocean green,<br/>Beneath that opening spot of blue serene,<br/>Quivered like burning emerald; calm was spread<br/>On all below; but far on high, between<br/>Earth and the upper air, the vast clouds fled,<br/>Countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed.<br/><br/>For ever, as the war became more fierce<br/>Between the whirlwinds and the rack on high,<br/>That spot grew more serene; blue light did pierce<br/>The woof of those white clouds, which seem to lie<br/>Far, deep, and motionless; while through the sky<br/>The pallid semicircle of the moon<br/>Passed on, in slow and moving majesty;<br/>Its upper horn arrayed in mists, which soon<br/>But slowly fled, like dew beneath the beams of noon.<br/><br/>I could not choose but gaze; a fascination<br/>Dwelt in that moon, and sky, and clouds, which drew<br/>My fancy thither, and in expectation<br/>Of what I knew not, I remained:--the hue<br/>Of the white moon, amid that heaven so blue,<br/>Suddenly stained with shadow did appear;<br/>A speck, a cloud, a shape, approaching grew,<br/>Like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere<br/>Beheld afar at sea, and swift it came anear.<br/><br/>Even like a bark, which from a chasm of mountains,<br/>Dark, vast and overhanging, on a river<br/>Which there collects the strength of all its fountains,<br/>Comes forth, whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver,<br/>Sails, oars and stream, tending to one endeavour;<br/>So, from that chasm of light a winged Form<br/>On all the winds of heaven approaching ever<br/>Floated, dilating as it came; the storm<br/>Pursued it with fierce blasts, and lightnings swift and warm.<br/><br/>A course precipitous, of dizzy speed,<br/>Suspending thought and breath; a monstrous sight!<br/>For in the air do I behold indeed<br/>An Eagle and a Serpent wreathed in fight:--<br/>And now, relaxing its impetuous flight,<br/>Before the aerial rock on which I stood,<br/>The Eagle, hovering, wheeled to left and right,<br/>And hung with lingering wings over the flood,<br/>And startled with its yells the wide air's solitude.<br/><br/>A shaft of light upon its wings descended,<br/>And every golden feather gleamed therein--<br/>Feather and scale, inextricably blended.<br/>The Serpent's mailed and many-coloured skin<br/>Shone through the plumes its coils were twined within<br/>By many a swoln and knotted fold, and high<br/>And far, the neck, receding lithe and thin,<br/>Sustained a crested head, which warily<br/>Shifted and glanced before the Eagle's steadfast eye.<br/><br/>Around, around, in ceaseless circles wheeling<br/>With clang of wings and scream, the Eagle sailed<br/>Incessantly--sometimes on high concealing<br/>Its lessening orbs, sometimes as if it failed,<br/>Drooped through the air; and still it shrieked and wailed,<br/>And casting back its eager head, with beak<br/>And talon unremittingly assailed<br/>The wreathed Serpent, who did ever seek<br/>Upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak.<br/><br/>What life, what power, was kindled and arose<br/>Within the sphere of that appalling fray!<br/>For, from the encounter of those wondrous foes,<br/>A vapour like the sea's suspended spray<br/>Hung gathered; in the void air, far away,<br/>Floated the shattered plumes; bright scales did leap,<br/>Where'er the Eagle's talons made their way,<br/>Like sparks into the darkness;--as they sweep,<br/>Blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep.<br/><br/>Swift chances in that combat--many a check,<br/>And many a change, a dark and wild turmoil;<br/>Sometimes the Snake around his enemy's neck<br/>Locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil,<br/>Until the Eagle, faint with pain and toil,<br/>Remitted his strong flight, and near the sea<br/>Languidly fluttered, hopeless so to foil<br/>His adversary, who then reared on high<br/>His red and burning crest, radiant with victory.<br/><br/>Then on the white edge of the bursting surge,<br/>Where they had sunk together, would the Snake<br/>Relax his suffocating grasp, and scourge<br/>The wind with his wild writhings; for to break<br/>That chain of torment, the vast bird would shake<br/>The strength of his unconquerable wings<br/>As in despair, and with his sinewy neck,<br/>Dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings--<br/>Then soar, as swift as smoke from a volcano springs.<br/><br/>Wile baffled wile, and strength encountered strength,<br/>Thus long, but unprevailing:--the event<br/>Of that portentous fight appeared at length:<br/>Until the lamp of day was almost spent<br/>It had endured, when lifeless, stark, and rent,<br/>Hung high that mighty Serpent, and at last<br/>Fell to the sea, while o'er the continent<br/>With clang of wings and scream the Eagle passed,<br/>Heavily borne away on the exhausted blast.<br/><br/>And with it fled the tempest, so that ocean<br/>And earth and sky shone through the atmosphere--<br/>Only, 'twas strange to see the red commotion<br/>Of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere<br/>Of sunset sweep, and their fierce roar to hear<br/>Amid the calm: down the steep path I wound<br/>To the sea-shore--the evening was most clear<br/>And beautiful, and there the sea I found<br/>Calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound.<br/><br/>There was a Woman, beautiful as morning,<br/>Sitting beneath the rocks, upon the sand<br/>Of the waste sea--fair as one flower adorning<br/>An icy wilderness; each delicate hand<br/>Lay crossed upon her bosom, and the band<br/>Of her dark hair had fall'n, and so she sate<br/>Looking upon the waves; on the bare strand<br/>Upon the sea-mark a small boat did wait,<br/>Fair as herself, like Love by Hope left desolate.<br/><br/>It seemed that this fair Shape had looked upon<br/>That unimaginable fight, and now<br/>That her sweet eyes were weary of the sun,<br/>As brightly it illustrated her woe;<br/>For in the tears which silently to flow<br/>Paused not, its lustre hung: she watching aye<br/>The foam-wreaths which the faint tide wove below<br/>Upon the spangled sands, groaned heavily,<br/>And after every groan looked up over the sea.<br/><br/>And when she saw the wounded Serpent make<br/>His path between the waves, her lips grew pale,<br/>Parted, and quivered; the tears ceased to break<br/>From her immovable eyes; no voice of wail<br/>Escaped her; but she rose, and on the gale<br/>Loosening her star-bright robe and shadowy hair<br/>Poured forth her voice; the caverns of the vale<br/>That opened to the ocean, caught it there,<br/>And filled with silver sounds the overflowing air.<br/><br/>She spake in language whose strange melody<br/>Might not belong to earth. I heard alone,<br/>What made its music more melodious be,<br/>The pity and the love of every tone;<br/>But to the Snake those accents sweet were known<br/>His native tongue and hers; nor did he beat<br/>The hoar spray idly then, but winding on<br/>Through the green shadows of the waves that meet<br/>Near to the shore, did pause beside her snowy feet.<br/><br/>Then on the sands the Woman sate again,<br/>And wept and clasped her hands, and all between,<br/>Renewed the unintelligible strain<br/>Of her melodious voice and eloquent mien;<br/>And she unveiled her bosom, and the green<br/>And glancing shadows of the sea did play<br/>O'er its marmoreal depth:--one moment seen,<br/>For ere the next, the Serpent did obey<br/>Her voice, and, coiled in rest in her embrace it lay.<br/><br/>Then she arose, and smiled on me with eyes<br/>Serene yet sorrowing, like that planet fair,<br/>While yet the daylight lingereth in the skies<br/>Which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark-red air,<br/>And said: 'To grieve is wise, but the despair<br/>Was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep:<br/>This shalt thou know, and more, if thou dost dare<br/>With me and with this Serpent, o'er the deep,<br/>A voyage divine and strange, companionship to keep.'<br/><br/>Her voice was like the wildest, saddest tone,<br/>Yet sweet, of some loved voice heard long ago.<br/>I wept. 'Shall this fair woman all alone,<br/>Over the sea with that fierce Serpent go?<br/>His head is on her heart, and who can know<br/>How soon he may devour his feeble prey?'--<br/>Such were my thoughts, when the tide gan to flow;<br/>And that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway<br/>Amid reflected stars that in the waters lay:--<br/><br/>A boat of rare device, which had no sail<br/>But its own curved prow of thin moonstone,<br/>Wrought like a web of texture fine and frail,<br/>To catch those gentlest winds which are not known<br/>To breathe, but by the steady speed alone<br/>With which it cleaves the sparkling sea; and now<br/>We are embarked--the mountains hang and frown<br/>Over the starry deep that gleams below,<br/>A vast and dim expanse, as o'er the waves we go.<br/><br/>And as we sailed, a strange and awful tale<br/>That Woman told, like such mysterious dream<br/>As makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale!<br/>'Twas midnight, and around, a shoreless stream,<br/>Wide ocean rolled, when that majestic theme<br/>Shrined in her heart found utterance, and she bent<br/>Her looks on mine; those eyes a kindling beam<br/>Of love divine into my spirit sent,<br/>And ere her lips could move, made the air eloquent.<br/><br/>'Speak not to me, but hear! Much shalt thou learn,<br/>Much must remain unthought, and more untold,<br/>In the dark Future's ever-flowing urn:<br/>Know then, that from the depth of ages old<br/>Two Powers o'er mortal things dominion hold,<br/>Ruling the world with a divided lot,<br/>Immortal, all-pervading, manifold,<br/>Twin Genii, equal Gods--when life and thought<br/>Sprang forth, they burst the womb of inessential Nought.<br/><br/>'The earliest dweller of the world, alone,<br/>Stood on the verge of chaos. Lo! afar<br/>O'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone,<br/>Sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar:<br/>A blood-red Comet and the Morning Star<br/>Mingling their beams in combat--as he stood,<br/>All thoughts within his mind waged mutual war,<br/>In dreadful sympathy--when to the flood<br/>That fair Star fell, he turned and shed his brother's blood.<br/><br/>'Thus evil triumphed, and the Spirit of evil,<br/>One Power of many shapes which none may know,<br/>One Shape of many names; the Fiend did revel<br/>In victory, reigning o'er a world of woe,<br/>For the new race of man went to and fro,<br/>Famished and homeless, loathed and loathing, wild,<br/>And hating good--for his immortal foe,<br/>He changed from starry shape, beauteous and mild,<br/>To a dire Snake, with man and beast unreconciled.<br/><br/>'The darkness lingering o'er the dawn of things,<br/>Was Evil's breath and life; this made him strong<br/>To soar aloft with overshadowing wings;<br/>And the great Spirit of Good did creep among<br/>The nations of mankind, and every tongue<br/>Cursed and blasphemed him as he passed; for none<br/>Knew good from evil, though their names were hung<br/>In mockery o'er the fane where many a groan,<br/>As King, and Lord, and God, the conquering Fiend did own,--<br/><br/>'The Fiend, whose name was Legion: Death, Decay,<br/>Earthquake and Blight, and Want, and Madness pale,<br/>Winged and wan diseases, an array<br/>Numerous as leaves that strew the autumnal gale;<br/>Poison, a snake in flowers, beneath the veil<br/>Of food and mirth, hiding his mortal head;<br/>And, without whom all these might nought avail,<br/>Fear, Hatred, Faith, and Tyranny, who spread<br/>Those subtle nets which snare the living and the dead.<br/><br/>'His spirit is their power, and they his slaves<br/>In air, and light, and thought, and language, dwell;<br/>And keep their state from palaces to graves,<br/>In all resorts of men--invisible,<br/>But when, in ebon mirror, Nightmare fell<br/>To tyrant or impostor bids them rise,<br/>Black winged demon forms--whom, from the hell,<br/>His reign and dwelling beneath nether skies,<br/>He loosens to their dark and blasting ministries.<br/><br/>'In the world's youth his empire was as firm<br/>As its foundations...Soon the Spirit of Good,<br/>Though in the likeness of a loathsome worm,<br/>Sprang from the billows of the formless flood,<br/>Which shrank and fled; and with that Fiend of blood<br/>Renewed the doubtful war...Thrones then first shook,<br/>And earth's immense and trampled multitude<br/>In hope on their own powers began to look,<br/>And Fear, the demon pale, his sanguine shrine forsook.<br/><br/>'Then Greece arose, and to its bards and sages,<br/>In dream, the golden-pinioned Genii came,<br/>Even where they slept amid the night of ages,<br/>Steeping their hearts in the divinest flame<br/>Which thy breath kindled, Power of holiest name!<br/>And oft in cycles since, when darkness gave<br/>New weapons to thy foe, their sunlike fame<br/>Upon the combat shone--a light to save,<br/>Like Paradise spread forth beyond the shadowy grave.<br/><br/>'Such is this conflict--when mankind doth strive<br/>With its oppressors in a strife of blood,<br/>Or when free thoughts, like lightnings, are alive,<br/>And in each bosom of the multitude<br/>Justice and truth with Custom's hydra brood<br/>Wage silent war; when Priests and Kings dissemble<br/>In smiles or frowns their fierce disquietude,<br/>When round pure hearts a host of hopes assemble,<br/>The Snake and Eagle meet--the world's foundations tremble!<br/><br/>'Thou hast beheld that fight--when to thy home<br/>Thou dost return, steep not its hearth in tears;<br/>Though thou may'st hear that earth is now become<br/>The tyrant's garbage, which to his compeers,<br/>The vile reward of their dishonoured years,<br/>He will dividing give.--The victor Fiend,<br/>Omnipotent of yore, now quails, and fears<br/>His triumph dearly won, which soon will lend<br/>An impulse swift and sure to his approaching end.<br/><br/>'List, stranger, list, mine is an human form,<br/>Like that thou wearest--touch me--shrink not now!<br/>My hand thou feel'st is not a ghost's, but warm<br/>With human blood.--'Twas many years ago,<br/>Since first my thirsting soul aspired to know<br/>The secrets of this wondrous world, when deep<br/>My heart was pierced with sympathy, for woe<br/>Which could not be mine own, and thought did keep,<br/>In dream, unnatural watch beside an infant's sleep.<br/><br/>'Woe could not be mine own, since far from men<br/>I dwelt, a free and happy orphan child,<br/>By the sea-shore, in a deep mountain glen;<br/>And near the waves, and through the forests wild,<br/>I roamed, to storm and darkness reconciled:<br/>For I was calm while tempest shook the sky:<br/>But when the breathless heavens in beauty smiled,<br/>I wept, sweet tears, yet too tumultuously<br/>For peace, and clasped my hands aloft in ecstasy.<br/><br/>'These were forebodings of my fate--before<br/>A woman's heart beat in my virgin breast,<br/>It had been nurtured in divinest lore:<br/>A dying poet gave me books, and blessed<br/>With wild but holy talk the sweet unrest<br/>In which I watched him as he died away--<br/>A youth with hoary hair--a fleeting guest<br/>Of our lone mountains: and this lore did sway<br/>My spirit like a storm, contending there alway.<br/><br/>'Thus the dark tale which history doth unfold<br/>I knew, but not, methinks, as others know,<br/>For they weep not; and Wisdom had unrolled<br/>The clouds which hide the gulf of mortal woe,--<br/>To few can she that warning vision show--<br/>For I loved all things with intense devotion;<br/>So that when Hope's deep source in fullest flow,<br/>Like earthquake did uplift the stagnant ocean<br/>Of human thoughts--mine shook beneath the wide emotion.<br/><br/>'When first the living blood through all these veins<br/>Kindled a thought in sense, great France sprang forth,<br/>And seized, as if to break, the ponderous chains<br/>Which bind in woe the nations of the earth.<br/>I saw, and started from my cottage-hearth;<br/>And to the clouds and waves in tameless gladness<br/>Shrieked, till they caught immeasurable mirth--<br/>And laughed in light and music: soon, sweet madness<br/>Was poured upon my heart, a soft and thrilling sadness.<br/><br/>'Deep slumber fell on me:--my dreams were fire--<br/>Soft and delightful thoughts did rest and hover<br/>Like shadows o'er my brain; and strange desire,<br/>The tempest of a passion, raging over<br/>My tranquil soul, its depths with light did cover,<br/>Which passed; and calm, and darkness, sweeter far,<br/>Came--then I loved; but not a human lover!<br/>For when I rose from sleep, the Morning Star<br/>Shone through the woodbine-wreaths which round my casement were.<br/><br/>''Twas like an eye which seemed to smile on me.<br/>I watched, till by the sun made pale, it sank<br/>Under the billows of the heaving sea;<br/>But from its beams deep love my spirit drank,<br/>And to my brain the boundless world now shrank<br/>Into one thought--one image--yes, for ever!<br/>Even like the dayspring, poured on vapours dank,<br/>The beams of that one Star did shoot and quiver<br/>Through my benighted mind--and were extinguished never.<br/><br/>'The day passed thus: at night, methought, in dream<br/>A shape of speechless beauty did appear:<br/>It stood like light on a careering stream<br/>Of golden clouds which shook the atmosphere;<br/>A winged youth, his radiant brow did wear<br/>The Morning Star: a wild dissolving bliss<br/>Over my frame he breathed, approaching near,<br/>And bent his eyes of kindling tenderness<br/>Near mine, and on my lips impressed a lingering kiss,--<br/><br/>'And said: "A Spirit loves thee, mortal maiden,<br/>How wilt thou prove thy worth?" Then joy and sleep<br/>Together fled; my soul was deeply laden,<br/>And to the shore I went to muse and weep;<br/>But as I moved, over my heart did creep<br/>A joy less soft, but more profound and strong<br/>Than my sweet dream; and it forbade to keep<br/>The path of the sea-shore: that Spirit's tongue<br/>Seemed whispering in my heart, and bore my steps along.<br/><br/>'How, to that vast and peopled city led,<br/>Which was a field of holy warfare then,<br/>I walked among the dying and the dead,<br/>And shared in fearless deeds with evil men,<br/>Calm as an angel in the dragon's den--<br/>How I braved death for liberty and truth,<br/>And spurned at peace, and power, and fame--and when<br/>Those hopes had lost the glory of their youth,<br/>How sadly I returned--might move the hearer's ruth:<br/><br/>'Warm tears throng fast! the tale may not be said--<br/>Know then, that when this grief had been subdued,<br/>I was not left, like others, cold and dead;<br/>The Spirit whom I loved, in solitude<br/>Sustained his child: the tempest-shaken wood,<br/>The waves, the fountains, and the hush of night--<br/>These were his voice, and well I understood<br/>His smile divine, when the calm sea was bright<br/>With silent stars, and Heaven was breathless with delight.<br/><br/>'In lonely glens, amid the roar of rivers,<br/>When the dim nights were moonless, have I known<br/>Joys which no tongue can tell; my pale lip quivers<br/>When thought revisits them:--know thou alone,<br/>That after many wondrous years were flown,<br/>I was awakened by a shriek of woe;<br/>And over me a mystic robe was thrown,<br/>By viewless hands, and a bright Star did glow<br/>Before my steps--the Snake then met his mortal foe.'<br/><br/>'Thou fearest not then the Serpent on thy heart?'<br/>'Fear it!' she said, with brief and passionate cry,<br/>And spake no more: that silence made me start--<br/>I looked, and we were sailing pleasantly,<br/>Swift as a cloud between the sea and sky;<br/>Beneath the rising moon seen far away,<br/>Mountains of ice, like sapphire, piled on high,<br/>Hemming the horizon round, in silence lay<br/>On the still waters--these we did approach alway.<br/><br/>And swift and swifter grew the vessel's motion,<br/>So that a dizzy trance fell on my brain--<br/>Wild music woke me; we had passed the ocean<br/>Which girds the pole, Nature's remotest reign--<br/>And we glode fast o'er a pellucid plain<br/>Of waters, azure with the noontide day.<br/>Ethereal mountains shone around--a Fane<br/>Stood in the midst, girt by green isles which lay<br/>On the blue sunny deep, resplendent far away.<br/><br/>It was a Temple, such as mortal hand<br/>Has never built, nor ecstasy, nor dream<br/>Reared in the cities of enchanted land:<br/>'Twas likest Heaven, ere yet day's purple stream<br/>Ebbs o'er the western forest, while the gleam<br/>Of the unrisen moon among the clouds<br/>Is gathering--when with many a golden beam<br/>The thronging constellations rush in crowds,<br/>Paving with fire the sky and the marmoreal floods.<br/><br/>Like what may be conceived of this vast dome,<br/>When from the depths which thought can seldom pierce<br/>Genius beholds it rise, his native home,<br/>Girt by the deserts of the Universe;<br/>Yet, nor in painting's light, or mightier verse,<br/>Or sculpture's marble language, can invest<br/>That shape to mortal sense--such glooms immerse<br/>That incommunicable sight, and rest<br/>Upon the labouring brain and overburdened breast.<br/><br/>Winding among the lawny islands fair,<br/>Whose blosmy forests starred the shadowy deep,<br/>The wingless boat paused where an ivory stair<br/>Its fretwork in the crystal sea did steep,<br/>Encircling that vast Fane's aerial heap:<br/>We disembarked, and through a portal wide<br/>We passed--whose roof of moonstone carved, did keep<br/>A glimmering o'er the forms on every side,<br/>Sculptures like life and thought, immovable, deep-eyed.<br/><br/>We came to a vast hall, whose glorious roof<br/>Was diamond, which had drunk the lightning's sheen<br/>In darkness, and now poured it through the woof<br/>Of spell-inwoven clouds hung there to screen<br/>Its blinding splendour--through such veil was seen<br/>That work of subtlest power, divine and rare;<br/>Orb above orb, with starry shapes between,<br/>And horned moons, and meteors strange and fair,<br/>On night-black columns poised--one hollow hemisphere!<br/><br/>Ten thousand columns in that quivering light<br/>Distinct--between whose shafts wound far away<br/>The long and labyrinthine aisles--more bright<br/>With their own radiance than the Heaven of Day;<br/>And on the jasper walls around, there lay<br/>Paintings, the poesy of mightiest thought,<br/>Which did the Spirit's history display;<br/>A tale of passionate change, divinely taught,<br/>Which, in their winged dance, unconscious Genii wrought.<br/><br/>Beneath, there sate on many a sapphire throne,<br/>The Great, who had departed from mankind,<br/>A mighty Senate;--some, whose white hair shone<br/>Like mountain snow, mild, beautiful, and blind;<br/>Some, female forms, whose gestures beamed with mind;<br/>And ardent youths, and children bright and fair;<br/>And some had lyres whose strings were intertwined<br/>With pale and clinging flames, which ever there<br/>Waked faint yet thrilling sounds that pierced the crystal air.<br/><br/>One seat was vacant in the midst, a throne,<br/>Reared on a pyramid like sculptured flame,<br/>Distinct with circling steps which rested on<br/>Their own deep fire--soon as the Woman came<br/>Into that hall, she shrieked the Spirit's name<br/>And fell; and vanished slowly from the sight.<br/>Darkness arose from her dissolving frame,<br/>Which gathering, filled that dome of woven light,<br/>Blotting its sphered stars with supernatural night.<br/><br/>Then first, two glittering lights were seen to glide<br/>In circles on the amethystine floor,<br/>Small serpent eyes trailing from side to side,<br/>Like meteors on a river's grassy shore,<br/>They round each other rolled, dilating more<br/>And more--then rose, commingling into one,<br/>One clear and mighty planet hanging o'er<br/>A cloud of deepest shadow, which was thrown<br/>Athwart the glowing steps and the crystalline throne.<br/><br/>The cloud which rested on that cone of flame<br/>Was cloven; beneath the planet sate a Form,<br/>Fairer than tongue can speak or thought may frame,<br/>The radiance of whose limbs rose-like and warm<br/>Flowed forth, and did with softest light inform<br/>The shadowy dome, the sculptures, and the state<br/>Of those assembled shapes--with clinging charm<br/>Sinking upon their hearts and mine. He sate<br/>Majestic, yet most mild--calm, yet compassionate.<br/><br/>Wonder and joy a passing faintness threw<br/>Over my brow--a hand supported me,<br/>Whose touch was magic strength; an eye of blue<br/>Looked into mine, like moonlight, soothingly;<br/>And a voice said:--'Thou must a listener be<br/>This day--two mighty Spirits now return,<br/>Like birds of calm, from the world's raging sea,<br/>They pour fresh light from Hope's immortal urn;<br/>A tale of human power--despair not--list and learn!<br/><br/>I looked, and lo! one stood forth eloquently.<br/>His eyes were dark and deep, and the clear brow<br/>Which shadowed them was like the morning sky,<br/>The cloudless Heaven of Spring, when in their flow<br/>Through the bright air, the soft winds as they blow<br/>Wake the green world--his gestures did obey<br/>The oracular mind that made his features glow,<br/>And where his curved lips half-open lay,<br/>Passion's divinest stream had made impetuous way.<br/><br/>Beneath the darkness of his outspread hair<br/>He stood thus beautiful; but there was One<br/>Who sate beside him like his shadow there,<br/>And held his hand--far lovelier; she was known<br/>To be thus fair, by the few lines alone<br/>Which through her floating locks and gathered cloak,<br/>Glances of soul-dissolving glory, shone:--<br/>None else beheld her eyes--in him they woke<br/>Memories which found a tongue as thus he silence broke.<br/><br/>CANTO 2.<br/><br/>The starlight smile of children, the sweet looks<br/>Of women, the fair breast from which I fed,<br/>The murmur of the unreposing brooks,<br/>And the green light which, shifting overhead,<br/>Some tangled bower of vines around me shed,<br/>The shells on the sea-sand, and the wild flowers,<br/>The lamp-light through the rafters cheerly spread,<br/>And on the twining flax--in life's young hours<br/>These sights and sounds did nurse my spirit's folded powers.<br/><br/>In Argolis, beside the echoing sea,<br/>Such impulses within my mortal frame<br/>Arose, and they were dear to memory,<br/>Like tokens of the dead:--but others came<br/>Soon, in another shape: the wondrous fame<br/>Of the past world, the vital words and deeds<br/>Of minds whom neither time nor change can tame,<br/>Traditions dark and old, whence evil creeds<br/>Start forth, and whose dim shade a stream of poison feeds.<br/><br/>I heard, as all have heard, the various story<br/>Of human life, and wept unwilling tears.<br/>Feeble historians of its shame and glory,<br/>False disputants on all its hopes and fears,<br/>Victims who worshipped ruin, chroniclers<br/>Of daily scorn, and slaves who loathed their state<br/>Yet, flattering power, had given its ministers<br/>A throne of judgement in the grave:--'twas fate,<br/>That among such as these my youth should seek its mate.<br/><br/>The land in which I lived, by a fell bane<br/>Was withered up. Tyrants dwelt side by side,<br/>And stabled in our homes,--until the chain<br/>Stifled the captive's cry, and to abide<br/>That blasting curse men had no shame--all vied<br/>In evil, slave and despot; fear with lust<br/>Strange fellowship through mutual hate had tied,<br/>Like two dark serpents tangled in the dust,<br/>Which on the paths of men their mingling poison thrust.<br/><br/>Earth, our bright home, its mountains and its waters,<br/>And the ethereal shapes which are suspended<br/>Over its green expanse, and those fair daughters,<br/>The clouds, of Sun and Ocean, who have blended<br/>The colours of the air since first extended<br/>It cradled the young world, none wandered forth<br/>To see or feel; a darkness had descended<br/>On every heart; the light which shows its worth,<br/>Must among gentle thoughts and fearless take its birth.<br/><br/>This vital world, this home of happy spirits,<br/>Was as a dungeon to my blasted kind;<br/>All that despair from murdered hope inherits<br/>They sought, and in their helpless misery blind,<br/>A deeper prison and heavier chains did find,<br/>And stronger tyrants:--a dark gulf before,<br/>The realm of a stern Ruler, yawned; behind,<br/>Terror and Time conflicting drove, and bore<br/>On their tempestuous flood the shrieking wretch from shore.<br/><br/>Out of that Ocean's wrecks had Guilt and Woe<br/>Framed a dark dwelling for their homeless thought,<br/>And, starting at the ghosts which to and fro<br/>Glide o'er its dim and gloomy strand, had brought<br/>The worship thence which they each other taught.<br/>Well might men loathe their life, well might they turn<br/>Even to the ills again from which they sought<br/>Such refuge after death!--well might they learn<br/>To gaze on this fair world with hopeless unconcern!<br/><br/>For they all pined in bondage; body and soul,<br/>Tyrant and slave, victim and torturer, bent<br/>Before one Power, to which supreme control<br/>Over their will by their own weakness lent,<br/>Made all its many names omnipotent;<br/>All symbols of things evil, all divine;<br/>And hymns of blood or mockery, which rent<br/>The air from all its fanes, did intertwine<br/>Imposture's impious toils round each discordant shrine.<br/><br/>I heard, as all have heard, life's various story,<br/>And in no careless heart transcribed the tale;<br/>But, from the sneers of men who had grown hoary<br/>In shame and scorn, from groans of crowds made pale<br/>By famine, from a mother's desolate wail<br/>O'er her polluted child, from innocent blood<br/>Poured on the earth, and brows anxious and pale<br/>With the heart's warfare, did I gather food<br/>To feed my many thoughts--a tameless multitude!<br/><br/>I wandered through the wrecks of days departed<br/>Far by the desolated shore, when even<br/>O'er the still sea and jagged islets darted<br/>The light of moonrise; in the northern Heaven,<br/>Among the clouds near the horizon driven,<br/>The mountains lay beneath one planet pale;<br/>Around me, broken tombs and columns riven<br/>Looked vast in twilight, and the sorrowing gale<br/>Waked in those ruins gray its everlasting wail!<br/><br/>I knew not who had framed these wonders then,<br/>Nor had I heard the story of their deeds;<br/>But dwellings of a race of mightier men,<br/>And monuments of less ungentle creeds<br/>Tell their own tale to him who wisely heeds<br/>The language which they speak; and now, to me<br/>The moonlight making pale the blooming weeds,<br/>The bright stars shining in the breathless sea,<br/>Interpreted those scrolls of mortal mystery.<br/><br/>Such man has been, and such may yet become!<br/>Ay, wiser, greater, gentler even than they<br/>Who on the fragments of yon shattered dome<br/>Have stamped the sign of power--I felt the sway<br/>Of the vast stream of ages bear away<br/>My floating thoughts--my heart beat loud and fast--<br/>Even as a storm let loose beneath the ray<br/>Of the still moon, my spirit onward passed<br/>Beneath truth's steady beams upon its tumult cast.<br/><br/>It shall be thus no more! too long, too long,<br/>Sons of the glorious dead, have ye lain bound<br/>In darkness and in ruin!--Hope is strong,<br/>Justice and Truth their winged child have found--<br/>Awake! arise! until the mighty sound<br/>Of your career shall scatter in its gust<br/>The thrones of the oppressor, and the ground<br/>Hide the last altar's unregarded dust,<br/>Whose Idol has so long betrayed your impious trust!<br/><br/>It must be so--I will arise and waken<br/>The multitude, and like a sulphurous hill,<br/>Which on a sudden from its snows has shaken<br/>The swoon of ages, it shall burst and fill<br/>The world with cleansing fire; it must, it will--<br/>It may not be restrained!--and who shall stand<br/>Amid the rocking earthquake steadfast still,<br/>But Laon? on high Freedom's desert land<br/>A tower whose marble walls the leagued storms withstand!<br/><br/>One summer night, in commune with the hope<br/>Thus deeply fed, amid those ruins gray<br/>I watched, beneath the dark sky's starry cope;<br/>And ever from that hour upon me lay<br/>The burden of this hope, and night or day,<br/>In vision or in dream, clove to my breast:<br/>Among mankind, or when gone far away<br/>To the lone shores and mountains, 'twas a guest<br/>Which followed where I fled, and watched when I did rest.<br/><br/>These hopes found words through which my spirit sought<br/>To weave a bondage of such sympathy,<br/>As might create some response to the thought<br/>Which ruled me now--and as the vapours lie<br/>Bright in the outspread morning's radiancy,<br/>So were these thoughts invested with the light<br/>Of language: and all bosoms made reply<br/>On which its lustre streamed, whene'er it might<br/>Through darkness wide and deep those tranced spirits smite.<br/><br/>Yes, many an eye with dizzy tears was dim,<br/>And oft I thought to clasp my own heart's brother,<br/>When I could feel the listener's senses swim,<br/>And hear his breath its own swift gaspings smother<br/>Even as my words evoked them--and another,<br/>And yet another, I did fondly deem,<br/>Felt that we all were sons of one great mother;<br/>And the cold truth such sad reverse did seem<br/>As to awake in grief from some delightful dream.<br/><br/>Yes, oft beside the ruined labyrinth<br/>Which skirts the hoary caves of the green deep,<br/>Did Laon and his friend, on one gray plinth,<br/>Round whose worn base the wild waves hiss and leap,<br/>Resting at eve, a lofty converse keep:<br/>And that this friend was false, may now be said<br/>Calmly--that he like other men could weep<br/>Tears which are lies, and could betray and spread<br/>Snares for that guileless heart which for his own had bled.<br/><br/>Then, had no great aim recompensed my sorrow,<br/>I must have sought dark respite from its stress<br/>In dreamless rest, in sleep that sees no morrow--<br/>For to tread life's dismaying wilderness<br/>Without one smile to cheer, one voice to bless,<br/>Amid the snares and scoffs of human kind,<br/>Is hard--but I betrayed it not, nor less<br/>With love that scorned return sought to unbind<br/>The interwoven clouds which make its wisdom blind.<br/><br/>With deathless minds which leave where they have passed<br/>A path of light, my soul communion knew;<br/>Till from that glorious intercourse, at last,<br/>As from a mine of magic store, I drew<br/>Words which were weapons;--round my heart there grew<br/>The adamantine armour of their power;<br/>And from my fancy wings of golden hue<br/>Sprang forth--yet not alone from wisdom's tower,<br/>A minister of truth, these plumes young Laon bore.<br/><br/>An orphan with my parents lived, whose eyes<br/>Were lodestars of delight, which drew me home<br/>When I might wander forth; nor did I prize<br/>Aught human thing beneath Heaven's mighty dome<br/>Beyond this child; so when sad hours were come,<br/>And baffled hope like ice still clung to me,<br/>Since kin were cold, and friends had now become<br/>Heartless and false, I turned from all, to be,<br/>Cythna, the only source of tears and smiles to thee.<br/><br/>What wert thou then? A child most infantine,<br/>Yet wandering far beyond that innocent age<br/>In all but its sweet looks and mien divine;<br/>Even then, methought, with the world's tyrant rage<br/>A patient warfare thy young heart did wage,<br/>When those soft eyes of scarcely conscious thought<br/>Some tale, or thine own fancies, would engage<br/>To overflow with tears, or converse fraught<br/>With passion, o'er their depths its fleeting light had wrought.<br/><br/>She moved upon this earth a shape of brightness,<br/>A power, that from its objects scarcely drew<br/>One impulse of her being--in her lightness<br/>Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew,<br/>Which wanders through the waste air's pathless blue,<br/>To nourish some far desert; she did seem<br/>Beside me, gathering beauty as she grew,<br/>Like the bright shade of some immortal dream<br/>Which walks, when tempest sleeps, the wave of life's dark stream.<br/><br/>As mine own shadow was this child to me,<br/>A second self, far dearer and more fair;<br/>Which clothed in undissolving radiancy<br/>All those steep paths which languor and despair<br/>Of human things, had made so dark and bare,<br/>But which I trod alone--nor, till bereft<br/>Of friends, and overcome by lonely care,<br/>Knew I what solace for that loss was left,<br/>Though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft.<br/><br/>Once she was dear, now she was all I had<br/>To love in human life--this playmate sweet,<br/>This child of twelve years old--so she was made<br/>My sole associate, and her willing feet<br/>Wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet,<br/>Beyond the aereal mountains whose vast cells<br/>The unreposing billows ever beat,<br/>Through forests wild and old, and lawny dells<br/>Where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells.<br/><br/>And warm and light I felt her clasping hand<br/>When twined in mine; she followed where I went,<br/>Through the lone paths of our immortal land.<br/>It had no waste but some memorial lent<br/>Which strung me to my toil--some monument<br/>Vital with mind; then Cythna by my side,<br/>Until the bright and beaming day were spent,<br/>Would rest, with looks entreating to abide,<br/>Too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied.<br/><br/>And soon I could not have refused her--thus<br/>For ever, day and night, we two were ne'er<br/>Parted, but when brief sleep divided us:<br/>And when the pauses of the lulling air<br/>Of noon beside the sea had made a lair<br/>For her soothed senses, in my arms she slept,<br/>And I kept watch over her slumbers there,<br/>While, as the shifting visions over her swept,<br/>Amid her innocent rest by turns she smiled and wept.<br/><br/>And, in the murmur of her dreams was heard<br/>Sometimes the name of Laon:--suddenly<br/>She would arise, and, like the secret bird<br/>Whom sunset wakens, fill the shore and sky<br/>With her sweet accents, a wild melody!<br/>Hymns which my soul had woven to Freedom, strong<br/>The source of passion, whence they rose, to be;<br/>Triumphant strains, which, like a spirit's tongue,<br/>To the enchanted waves that child of glory sung--<br/><br/>Her white arms lifted through the shadowy stream<br/>Of her loose hair. Oh, excellently great<br/>Seemed to me then my purpose, the vast theme<br/>Of those impassioned songs, when Cythna sate<br/>Amid the calm which rapture doth create<br/>After its tumult, her heart vibrating,<br/>Her spirit o'er the Ocean's floating state<br/>From her deep eyes far wandering, on the wing<br/>Of visions that were mine, beyond its utmost spring!<br/><br/>For, before Cythna loved it, had my song<br/>Peopled with thoughts the boundless universe,<br/>A mighty congregation, which were strong<br/>Where'er they trod the darkness to disperse<br/>The cloud of that unutterable curse<br/>Which clings upon mankind:--all things became<br/>Slaves to my holy and heroic verse,<br/>Earth, sea and sky, the planets, life and fame<br/>And fate, or whate'er else binds the world's wondrous frame.<br/><br/>And this beloved child thus felt the sway<br/>Of my conceptions, gathering like a cloud<br/>The very wind on which it rolls away:<br/>Hers too were all my thoughts, ere yet, endowed<br/>With music and with light, their fountains flowed<br/>In poesy; and her still and earnest face,<br/>Pallid with feelings which intensely glowed<br/>Within, was turned on mine with speechless grace,<br/>Watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace.<br/><br/>In me, communion with this purest being<br/>Kindled intenser zeal, and made me wise<br/>In knowledge, which, in hers mine own mind seeing,<br/>Left in the human world few mysteries:<br/>How without fear of evil or disguise<br/>Was Cythna!--what a spirit strong and mild,<br/>Which death, or pain or peril could despise,<br/>Yet melt in tenderness! what genius wild<br/>Yet mighty, was enclosed within one simple child!<br/><br/>New lore was this--old age with its gray hair,<br/>And wrinkled legends of unworthy things,<br/>And icy sneers, is nought: it cannot dare<br/>To burst the chains which life for ever flings<br/>On the entangled soul's aspiring wings,<br/>So is it cold and cruel, and is made<br/>The careless slave of that dark power which brings<br/>Evil, like blight, on man, who, still betrayed,<br/>Laughs o'er the grave in which his living hopes are laid.<br/><br/>Nor are the strong and the severe to keep<br/>The empire of the world: thus Cythna taught<br/>Even in the visions of her eloquent sleep,<br/>Unconscious of the power through which she wrought<br/>The woof of such intelligible thought,<br/>As from the tranquil strength which cradled lay<br/>In her smile-peopled rest, my spirit sought<br/>Why the deceiver and the slave has sway<br/>O'er heralds so divine of truth's arising day.<br/><br/>Within that fairest form, the female mind,<br/>Untainted by the poison clouds which rest<br/>On the dark world, a sacred home did find:<br/>But else, from the wide earth's maternal breast,<br/>Victorious Evil, which had dispossessed<br/>All native power, had those fair children torn,<br/>And made them slaves to soothe his vile unrest,<br/>And minister to lust its joys forlorn,<br/>Till they had learned to breathe the atmosphere of scorn.<br/><br/>This misery was but coldly felt, till she<br/>Became my only friend, who had endued<br/>My purpose with a wider sympathy;<br/>Thus, Cythna mourned with me the servitude<br/>In which the half of humankind were mewed<br/>Victims of lust and hate, the slaves of slaves,<br/>She mourned that grace and power were thrown as food<br/>To the hyena lust, who, among graves,<br/>Over his loathed meal, laughing in agony, raves.<br/><br/>And I, still gazing on that glorious child,<br/>Even as these thoughts flushed o'er her:--'Cythna sweet,<br/>Well with the world art thou unreconciled;<br/>Never will peace and human nature meet<br/>Till free and equal man and woman greet<br/>Domestic peace; and ere this power can make<br/>In human hearts its calm and holy seat,<br/>This slavery must be broken'--as I spake,<br/>From Cythna's eyes a light of exultation brake.<br/><br/>She replied earnestly:--'It shall be mine,<br/>This task,--mine, Laon!--thou hast much to gain;<br/>Nor wilt thou at poor Cythna's pride repine,<br/>If she should lead a happy female train<br/>To meet thee over the rejoicing plain,<br/>When myriads at thy call shall throng around<br/>The Golden City.'--Then the child did strain<br/>My arm upon her tremulous heart, and wound<br/>Her own about my neck, till some reply she found.<br/><br/>I smiled, and spake not.--'Wherefore dost thou smile<br/>At what I say? Laon, I am not weak,<br/>And, though my cheek might become pale the while,<br/>With thee, if thou desirest, will I seek<br/>Through their array of banded slaves to wreak<br/>Ruin upon the tyrants. I had thought<br/>It was more hard to turn my unpractised cheek<br/>To scorn and shame, and this beloved spot<br/>And thee, O dearest friend, to leave and murmur not.<br/><br/>'Whence came I what I am? Thou, Laon, knowest<br/>How a young child should thus undaunted be;<br/>Methinks, it is a power which thou bestowest,<br/>Through which I seek, by most resembling thee,<br/>So to become most good and great and free;<br/>Yet far beyond this Ocean's utmost roar,<br/>In towers and huts are many like to me,<br/>Who, could they see thine eyes, or feel such lore<br/>As I have learnt from them, like me would fear no more.<br/><br/>'Think'st thou that I shall speak unskilfully,<br/>And none will heed me? I remember now,<br/>How once, a slave in tortures doomed to die,<br/>Was saved, because in accents sweet and low<br/>He sung a song his Judge loved long ago,<br/>As he was led to death.--All shall relent<br/>Who hear me--tears, as mine have flowed, shall flow,<br/>Hearts beat as mine now beats, with such intent<br/>As renovates the world; a will omnipotent!<br/><br/>'Yes, I will tread Pride's golden palaces,<br/>Through Penury's roofless huts and squalid cells<br/>Will I descend, where'er in abjectness<br/>Woman with some vile slave her tyrant dwells,<br/>There with the music of thine own sweet spells<br/>Will disenchant the captives, and will pour<br/>For the despairing, from the crystal wells<br/>Of thy deep spirit, reason's mighty lore,<br/>And power shall then abound, and hope arise once more.<br/><br/>'Can man be free if woman be a slave?<br/>Chain one who lives, and breathes this boundless air,<br/>To the corruption of a closed grave!<br/>Can they whose mates are beasts, condemned to bear<br/>Scorn, heavier far than toil or anguish, dare<br/>To trample their oppressors? in their home<br/>Among their babes, thou knowest a curse would wear<br/>The shape of woman--hoary Crime would come<br/>Behind, and Fraud rebuild religion's tottering dome.<br/><br/>'I am a child:--I would not yet depart.<br/>When I go forth alone, bearing the lamp<br/>Aloft which thou hast kindled in my heart,<br/>Millions of slaves from many a dungeon damp<br/>Shall leap in joy, as the benumbing cramp<br/>Of ages leaves their limbs--no ill may harm<br/>Thy Cythna ever--truth its radiant stamp<br/>Has fixed, as an invulnerable charm,<br/>Upon her children's brow, dark Falsehood to disarm.<br/><br/>'Wait yet awhile for the appointed day--<br/>Thou wilt depart, and I with tears shall stand<br/>Watching thy dim sail skirt the ocean gray;<br/>Amid the dwellers of this lonely land<br/>I shall remain alone--and thy command<br/>Shall then dissolve the world's unquiet trance,<br/>And, multitudinous as the desert sand<br/>Borne on the storm, its millions shall advance,<br/>Thronging round thee, the light of their deliverance.<br/><br/>'Then, like the forests of some pathless mountain,<br/>Which from remotest glens two warring winds<br/>Involve in fire which not the loosened fountain<br/>Of broadest floods might quench, shall all the kinds<br/>Of evil, catch from our uniting minds<br/>The spark which must consume them;--Cythna then<br/>Will have cast off the impotence that binds<br/>Her childhood now, and through the paths of men<br/>Will pass, as the charmed bird that haunts the serpent's den.<br/><br/>'We part!--O Laon, I must dare nor tremble,<br/>To meet those looks no more!--Oh, heavy stroke!<br/>Sweet brother of my soul! can I dissemble<br/>The agony of this thought?'--As thus she spoke<br/>The gathered sobs her quivering accents broke,<br/>And in my arms she hid her beating breast.<br/>I remained still for tears--sudden she woke<br/>As one awakes from sleep, and wildly pressed<br/>My bosom, her whole frame impetuously possessed.<br/><br/>'We part to meet again--but yon blue waste,<br/>Yon desert wide and deep, holds no recess,<br/>Within whose happy silence, thus embraced<br/>We might survive all ills in one caress:<br/>Nor doth the grave--I fear 'tis passionless--<br/>Nor yon cold vacant Heaven:--we meet again<br/>Within the minds of men, whose lips shall bless<br/>Our memory, and whose hopes its light retain<br/>When these dissevered bones are trodden in the plain.'<br/><br/>I could not speak, though she had ceased, for now<br/>The fountains of her feeling, swift and deep,<br/>Seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow;<br/>So we arose, and by the starlight steep<br/>Went homeward--neither did we speak nor weep,<br/>But, pale, were calm with passion--thus subdued<br/>Like evening shades that o'er the mountains creep,<br/>We moved towards our home; where, in this mood,<br/>Each from the other sought refuge in solitude.<br/><br/>CANTO 3.<br/><br/>What thoughts had sway o'er Cythna's lonely slumber<br/>That night, I know not; but my own did seem<br/>As if they might ten thousand years outnumber<br/>Of waking life, the visions of a dream<br/>Which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream<br/>Of mind; a boundless chaos wild and vast,<br/>Whose limits yet were never memory's theme:<br/>And I lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed,<br/>Sometimes for rapture sick, sometimes for pain aghast.<br/><br/>Two hours, whose mighty circle did embrace<br/>More time than might make gray the infant world,<br/>Rolled thus, a weary and tumultuous space:<br/>When the third came, like mist on breezes curled,<br/>From my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled:<br/>Methought, upon the threshold of a cave<br/>I sate with Cythna; drooping briony, pearled<br/>With dew from the wild streamlet's shattered wave,<br/>Hung, where we sate to taste the joys which Nature gave.<br/><br/>We lived a day as we were wont to live,<br/>But Nature had a robe of glory on,<br/>And the bright air o'er every shape did weave<br/>Intenser hues, so that the herbless stone,<br/>The leafless bough among the leaves alone,<br/>Had being clearer than its own could be,<br/>And Cythna's pure and radiant self was shown,<br/>In this strange vision, so divine to me,<br/>That if I loved before, now love was agony.<br/><br/>Morn fled, noon came, evening, then night descended,<br/>And we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere<br/>Of the calm moon--when suddenly was blended<br/>With our repose a nameless sense of fear;<br/>And from the cave behind I seemed to hear<br/>Sounds gathering upwards!--accents incomplete,<br/>And stifled shrieks,--and now, more near and near,<br/>A tumult and a rush of thronging feet<br/>The cavern's secret depths beneath the earth did beat.<br/><br/>The scene was changed, and away, away, away!<br/>Through the air and over the sea we sped,<br/>And Cythna in my sheltering bosom lay,<br/>And the winds bore me--through the darkness spread<br/>Around, the gaping earth then vomited<br/>Legions of foul and ghastly shapes, which hung<br/>Upon my flight; and ever, as we fled,<br/>They plucked at Cythna--soon to me then clung<br/>A sense of actual things those monstrous dreams among.<br/><br/>And I lay struggling in the impotence<br/>Of sleep, while outward life had burst its bound,<br/>Though, still deluded, strove the tortured sense<br/>To its dire wanderings to adapt the sound<br/>Which in the light of morn was poured around<br/>Our dwelling; breathless, pale and unaware<br/>I rose, and all the cottage crowded found<br/>With armed men, whose glittering swords were bare,<br/>And whose degraded limbs the tyrant's garb did wear.<br/><br/>And, ere with rapid lips and gathered brow<br/>I could demand the cause--a feeble shriek--<br/>It was a feeble shriek, faint, far and low,<br/>Arrested me--my mien grew calm and meek,<br/>And grasping a small knife, I went to seek<br/>That voice among the crowd--'twas Cythna's cry!<br/>Beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak<br/>Its whirlwind rage:--so I passed quietly<br/>Till I beheld, where bound, that dearest child did lie.<br/><br/>I started to behold her, for delight<br/>And exultation, and a joyance free,<br/>Solemn, serene and lofty, filled the light<br/>Of the calm smile with which she looked on me:<br/>So that I feared some brainless ecstasy,<br/>Wrought from that bitter woe, had wildered her--<br/>'Farewell! farewell!' she said, as I drew nigh;<br/>'At first my peace was marred by this strange stir,<br/>Now I am calm as truth--its chosen minister.<br/><br/>'Look not so, Laon--say farewell in hope,<br/>These bloody men are but the slaves who bear<br/>Their mistress to her task--it was my scope<br/>The slavery where they drag me now, to share,<br/>And among captives willing chains to wear<br/>Awhile--the rest thou knowest--return, dear friend!<br/>Let our first triumph trample the despair<br/>Which would ensnare us now, for in the end,<br/>In victory or in death our hopes and fears must blend.'<br/><br/>These words had fallen on my unheeding ear,<br/>Whilst I had watched the motions of the crew<br/>With seeming-careless glance; not many were<br/>Around her, for their comrades just withdrew<br/>To guard some other victim--so I drew<br/>My knife, and with one impulse, suddenly<br/>All unaware three of their number slew,<br/>And grasped a fourth by the throat, and with loud cry<br/>My countrymen invoked to death or liberty!<br/><br/>What followed then, I know not--for a stroke<br/>On my raised arm and naked head, came down,<br/>Filling my eyes with blood.--When I awoke,<br/>I felt that they had bound me in my swoon,<br/>And up a rock which overhangs the town,<br/>By the steep path were bearing me; below,<br/>The plain was filled with slaughter,--overthrown<br/>The vineyards and the harvests, and the glow<br/>Of blazing roofs shone far o'er the white Ocean's flow.<br/><br/>Upon that rock a mighty column stood,<br/>Whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky,<br/>Which to the wanderers o'er the solitude<br/>Of distant seas, from ages long gone by,<br/>Had made a landmark; o'er its height to fly<br/>Scarcely the cloud, the vulture, or the blast,<br/>Has power--and when the shades of evening lie<br/>On Earth and Ocean, its carved summits cast<br/>The sunken daylight far through the aerial waste.<br/><br/>They bore me to a cavern in the hill<br/>Beneath that column, and unbound me there;<br/>And one did strip me stark; and one did fill<br/>A vessel from the putrid pool; one bare<br/>A lighted torch, and four with friendless care<br/>Guided my steps the cavern-paths along,<br/>Then up a steep and dark and narrow stair<br/>We wound, until the torch's fiery tongue<br/>Amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung.<br/><br/>They raised me to the platform of the pile,<br/>That column's dizzy height:--the grate of brass<br/>Through which they thrust me, open stood the while,<br/>As to its ponderous and suspended mass,<br/>With chains which eat into the flesh, alas!<br/>With brazen links, my naked limbs they bound:<br/>The grate, as they departed to repass,<br/>With horrid clangour fell, and the far sound<br/>Of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned.<br/><br/>The noon was calm and bright:--around that column<br/>The overhanging sky and circling sea<br/>Spread forth in silentness profound and solemn<br/>The darkness of brief frenzy cast on me,<br/>So that I knew not my own misery:<br/>The islands and the mountains in the day<br/>Like clouds reposed afar; and I could see<br/>The town among the woods below that lay,<br/>And the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay.<br/><br/>It was so calm, that scarce the feathery weed<br/>Sown by some eagle on the topmost stone<br/>Swayed in the air:--so bright, that noon did breed<br/>No shadow in the sky beside mine own--<br/>Mine, and the shadow of my chain alone.<br/>Below, the smoke of roofs involved in flame<br/>Rested like night, all else was clearly shown<br/>In that broad glare; yet sound to me none came,<br/>But of the living blood that ran within my frame.<br/><br/>The peace of madness fled, and ah, too soon!<br/>A ship was lying on the sunny main,<br/>Its sails were flagging in the breathless noon--<br/>Its shadow lay beyond--that sight again<br/>Waked, with its presence, in my tranced brain<br/>The stings of a known sorrow, keen and cold:<br/>I knew that ship bore Cythna o'er the plain<br/>Of waters, to her blighting slavery sold,<br/>And watched it with such thoughts as must remain untold.<br/><br/>I watched until the shades of evening wrapped<br/>Earth like an exhalation--then the bark<br/>Moved, for that calm was by the sunset snapped.<br/>It moved a speck upon the Ocean dark:<br/>Soon the wan stars came forth, and I could mark<br/>Its path no more!--I sought to close mine eyes,<br/>But like the balls, their lids were stiff and stark;<br/>I would have risen, but ere that I could rise,<br/>My parched skin was split with piercing agonies.<br/><br/>I gnawed my brazen chain, and sought to sever<br/>Its adamantine links, that I might die:<br/>O Liberty! forgive the base endeavour,<br/>Forgive me, if, reserved for victory,<br/>The Champion of thy faith e'er sought to fly.--<br/>That starry night, with its clear silence, sent<br/>Tameless resolve which laughed at misery<br/>Into my soul--linked remembrance lent<br/>To that such power, to me such a severe content.<br/><br/>To breathe, to be, to hope, or to despair<br/>And die, I questioned not; nor, though the Sun<br/>Its shafts of agony kindling through the air<br/>Moved over me, nor though in evening dun,<br/>Or when the stars their visible courses run,<br/>Or morning, the wide universe was spread<br/>In dreary calmness round me, did I shun<br/>Its presence, nor seek refuge with the dead<br/>From one faint hope whose flower a dropping poison shed.<br/><br/>Two days thus passed--I neither raved nor died--<br/>Thirst raged within me, like a scorpion's nest<br/>Built in mine entrails; I had spurned aside<br/>The water-vessel, while despair possessed<br/>My thoughts, and now no drop remained! The uprest<br/>Of the third sun brought hunger--but the crust<br/>Which had been left, was to my craving breast<br/>Fuel, not food. I chewed the bitter dust,<br/>And bit my bloodless arm, and licked the brazen rust.<br/><br/>My brain began to fail when the fourth morn<br/>Burst o'er the golden isles--a fearful sleep,<br/>Which through the caverns dreary and forlorn<br/>Of the riven soul, sent its foul dreams to sweep<br/>With whirlwind swiftness--a fall far and deep,--<br/>A gulf, a void, a sense of senselessness--<br/>These things dwelt in me, even as shadows keep<br/>Their watch in some dim charnel's loneliness,<br/>A shoreless sea, a sky sunless and planetless!<br/><br/>The forms which peopled this terrific trance<br/>I well remember--like a choir of devils,<br/>Around me they involved a giddy dance;<br/>Legions seemed gathering from the misty levels<br/>Of Ocean, to supply those ceaseless revels,<br/>Foul, ceaseless shadows:--thought could not divide<br/>The actual world from these entangling evils,<br/>Which so bemocked themselves, that I descried<br/>All shapes like mine own self, hideously multiplied.<br/><br/>The sense of day and night, of false and true,<br/>Was dead within me. Yet two visions burst<br/>That darkness--one, as since that hour I knew,<br/>Was not a phantom of the realms accursed,<br/>Where then my spirit dwelt--but of the first<br/>I know not yet, was it a dream or no.<br/>But both, though not distincter, were immersed<br/>In hues which, when through memory's waste they flow,<br/>Make their divided streams more bright and rapid now.<br/><br/>Methought that grate was lifted, and the seven<br/>Who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare,<br/>And from the frieze to the four winds of Heaven<br/>Hung them on high by the entangled hair;<br/>Swarthy were three--the fourth was very fair;<br/>As they retired, the golden moon upsprung,<br/>And eagerly, out in the giddy air,<br/>Leaning that I might eat, I stretched and clung<br/>Over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung.<br/><br/>A woman's shape, now lank and cold and blue,<br/>The dwelling of the many-coloured worm,<br/>Hung there; the white and hollow cheek I drew<br/>To my dry lips--what radiance did inform<br/>Those horny eyes? whose was that withered form?<br/>Alas, alas! it seemed that Cythna's ghost<br/>Laughed in those looks, and that the flesh was warm<br/>Within my teeth!--a whirlwind keen as frost<br/>Then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed.<br/><br/>Then seemed it that a tameless hurricane<br/>Arose, and bore me in its dark career<br/>Beyond the sun, beyond the stars that wane<br/>On the verge of formless space--it languished there,<br/>And dying, left a silence lone and drear,<br/>More horrible than famine:--in the deep<br/>The shape of an old man did then appear,<br/>Stately and beautiful; that dreadful sleep<br/>His heavenly smiles dispersed, and I could wake and weep.<br/><br/>And, when the blinding tears had fallen, I saw<br/>That column, and those corpses, and the moon,<br/>And felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw<br/>My vitals, I rejoiced, as if the boon<br/>Of senseless death would be accorded soon;--<br/>When from that stony gloom a voice arose,<br/>Solemn and sweet as when low winds attune<br/>The midnight pines; the grate did then unclose,<br/>And on that reverend form the moonlight did repose.<br/><br/>He struck my chains, and gently spake and smiled;<br/>As they were loosened by that Hermit old,<br/>Mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled,<br/>To answer those kind looks; he did enfold<br/>His giant arms around me, to uphold<br/>My wretched frame; my scorched limbs he wound<br/>In linen moist and balmy, and as cold<br/>As dew to drooping leaves;--the chain, with sound<br/>Like earthquake, through the chasm of that steep stair did bound,<br/><br/>As, lifting me, it fell!--What next I heard,<br/>Were billows leaping on the harbour-bar,<br/>And the shrill sea-wind, whose breath idly stirred<br/>My hair;--I looked abroad, and saw a star<br/>Shining beside a sail, and distant far<br/>That mountain and its column, the known mark<br/>Of those who in the wide deep wandering are,<br/>So that I feared some Spirit, fell and dark,<br/>In trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark.<br/><br/>For now indeed, over the salt sea-billow<br/>I sailed: yet dared not look upon the shape<br/>Of him who ruled the helm, although the pillow<br/>For my light head was hollowed in his lap,<br/>And my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap,<br/>Fearing it was a fiend: at last, he bent<br/>O'er me his aged face; as if to snap<br/>Those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent,<br/>And to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent.<br/><br/>A soft and healing potion to my lips<br/>At intervals he raised--now looked on high,<br/>To mark if yet the starry giant dips<br/>His zone in the dim sea--now cheeringly,<br/>Though he said little, did he speak to me.<br/>'It is a friend beside thee--take good cheer,<br/>Poor victim, thou art now at liberty!'<br/>I joyed as those a human tone to hear,<br/>Who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year.<br/><br/>A dim and feeble joy, whose glimpses oft<br/>Were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams;<br/>Yet still methought we sailed, until aloft<br/>The stars of night grew pallid, and the beams<br/>Of morn descended on the ocean-streams,<br/>And still that aged man, so grand and mild,<br/>Tended me, even as some sick mother seems<br/>To hang in hope over a dying child,<br/>Till in the azure East darkness again was piled.<br/><br/>And then the night-wind steaming from the shore,<br/>Sent odours dying sweet across the sea,<br/>And the swift boat the little waves which bore,<br/>Were cut by its keen keel, though slantingly;<br/>Soon I could hear the leaves sigh, and could see<br/>The myrtle-blossoms starring the dim grove,<br/>As past the pebbly beach the boat did flee<br/>On sidelong wing, into a silent cove,<br/>Where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove.<br/><br/>CANTO 4.<br/><br/>The old man took the oars, and soon the bark<br/>Smote on the beach beside a tower of stone;<br/>It was a crumbling heap, whose portal dark<br/>With blooming ivy-trails was overgrown;<br/>Upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown,<br/>And rarest sea-shells, which the eternal flood,<br/>Slave to the mother of the months, had thrown<br/>Within the walls of that gray tower, which stood<br/>A changeling of man's art nursed amid Nature's brood.<br/><br/>When the old man his boat had anchored,<br/>He wound me in his arms with tender care,<br/>And very few, but kindly words he said,<br/>And bore me through the tower adown a stair,<br/>Whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear<br/>For many a year had fallen.--We came at last<br/>To a small chamber, which with mosses rare<br/>Was tapestried, where me his soft hands placed<br/>Upon a couch of grass and oak-leaves interlaced.<br/><br/>The moon was darting through the lattices<br/>Its yellow light, warm as the beams of day--<br/>So warm, that to admit the dewy breeze,<br/>The old man opened them; the moonlight lay<br/>Upon a lake whose waters wove their play<br/>Even to the threshold of that lonely home:<br/>Within was seen in the dim wavering ray<br/>The antique sculptured roof, and many a tome<br/>Whose lore had made that sage all that he had become.<br/><br/>The rock-built barrier of the sea was past,--<br/>And I was on the margin of a lake,<br/>A lonely lake, amid the forests vast<br/>And snowy mountains:--did my spirit wake<br/>From sleep as many-coloured as the snake<br/>That girds eternity? in life and truth,<br/>Might not my heart its cravings ever slake?<br/>Was Cythna then a dream, and all my youth,<br/>And all its hopes and fears, and all its joy and ruth?<br/><br/>Thus madness came again,--a milder madness,<br/>Which darkened nought but time's unquiet flow<br/>With supernatural shades of clinging sadness;<br/>That gentle Hermit, in my helpless woe,<br/>By my sick couch was busy to and fro,<br/>Like a strong spirit ministrant of good:<br/>When I was healed, he led me forth to show<br/>The wonders of his sylvan solitude,<br/>And we together sate by that isle-fretted flood.<br/><br/>He knew his soothing words to weave with skill<br/>From all my madness told; like mine own heart,<br/>Of Cythna would he question me, until<br/>That thrilling name had ceased to make me start,<br/>From his familiar lips--it was not art,<br/>Of wisdom and of justice when he spoke--<br/>When mid soft looks of pity, there would dart<br/>A glance as keen as is the lightning's stroke<br/>When it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak.<br/><br/>Thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled,<br/>My thoughts their due array did re-assume<br/>Through the enchantments of that Hermit old;<br/>Then I bethought me of the glorious doom<br/>Of those who sternly struggle to relume<br/>The lamp of Hope o'er man's bewildered lot,<br/>And, sitting by the waters, in the gloom<br/>Of eve, to that friend's heart I told my thought--<br/>That heart which had grown old, but had corrupted not.<br/><br/>That hoary man had spent his livelong age<br/>In converse with the dead, who leave the stamp<br/>Of ever-burning thoughts on many a page,<br/>When they are gone into the senseless damp<br/>Of graves;--his spirit thus became a lamp<br/>Of splendour, like to those on which it fed;<br/>Through peopled haunts, the City and the Camp,<br/>Deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led,<br/>And all the ways of men among mankind he read.<br/><br/>But custom maketh blind and obdurate<br/>The loftiest hearts;--he had beheld the woe<br/>In which mankind was bound, but deemed that fate<br/>Which made them abject, would preserve them so;<br/>And in such faith, some steadfast joy to know,<br/>He sought this cell: but when fame went abroad<br/>That one in Argolis did undergo<br/>Torture for liberty, and that the crowd<br/>High truths from gifted lips had heard and understood;<br/><br/>And that the multitude was gathering wide,--<br/>His spirit leaped within his aged frame;<br/>In lonely peace he could no more abide,<br/>But to the land on which the victor's flame<br/>Had fed, my native land, the Hermit came:<br/>Each heart was there a shield, and every tongue<br/>Was as a sword of truth--young Laon's name<br/>Rallied their secret hopes, though tyrants sung<br/>Hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among.<br/><br/>He came to the lone column on the rock,<br/>And with his sweet and mighty eloquence<br/>The hearts of those who watched it did unlock,<br/>And made them melt in tears of penitence.<br/>They gave him entrance free to bear me thence.<br/>'Since this,' the old man said, 'seven years are spent,<br/>While slowly truth on thy benighted sense<br/>Has crept; the hope which wildered it has lent<br/>Meanwhile, to me the power of a sublime intent.<br/><br/>'Yes, from the records of my youthful state,<br/>And from the lore of bards and sages old,<br/>From whatsoe'er my wakened thoughts create<br/>Out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold,<br/>Have I collected language to unfold<br/>Truth to my countrymen; from shore to shore<br/>Doctrines of human power my words have told,<br/>They have been heard, and men aspire to more<br/>Than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore.<br/><br/>'In secret chambers parents read, and weep,<br/>My writings to their babes, no longer blind;<br/>And young men gather when their tyrants sleep,<br/>And vows of faith each to the other bind;<br/>And marriageable maidens, who have pined<br/>With love, till life seemed melting through their look,<br/>A warmer zeal, a nobler hope, now find;<br/>And every bosom thus is rapt and shook,<br/>Like autumn's myriad leaves in one swoln mountain-brook.<br/><br/>'The tyrants of the Golden City tremble<br/>At voices which are heard about the streets;<br/>The ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble<br/>The lies of their own heart, but when one meets<br/>Another at the shrine, he inly weets,<br/>Though he says nothing, that the truth is known;<br/>Murderers are pale upon the judgement-seats,<br/>And gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone,<br/>And laughter fills the Fane, and curses shake the Throne.<br/><br/>'Kind thoughts, and mighty hopes, and gentle deeds<br/>Abound, for fearless love, and the pure law<br/>Of mild equality and peace, succeeds<br/>To faiths which long have held the world in awe,<br/>Bloody and false, and cold:--as whirlpools draw<br/>All wrecks of Ocean to their chasm, the sway<br/>Of thy strong genius, Laon, which foresaw<br/>This hope, compels all spirits to obey,<br/>Which round thy secret strength now throng in wide array.<br/><br/>'For I have been thy passive instrument'--<br/>(As thus the old man spake, his countenance<br/>Gleamed on me like a spirit's)--'thou hast lent<br/>To me, to all, the power to advance<br/>Towards this unforeseen deliverance<br/>From our ancestral chains--ay, thou didst rear<br/>That lamp of hope on high, which time nor chance<br/>Nor change may not extinguish, and my share<br/>Of good, was o'er the world its gathered beams to bear.<br/><br/>'But I, alas! am both unknown and old,<br/>And though the woof of wisdom I know well<br/>To dye in hues of language, I am cold<br/>In seeming, and the hopes which inly dwell,<br/>My manners note that I did long repel;<br/>But Laon's name to the tumultuous throng<br/>Were like the star whose beams the waves compel<br/>And tempests, and his soul-subduing tongue<br/>Were as a lance to quell the mailed crest of wrong.<br/><br/>'Perchance blood need not flow, if thou at length<br/>Wouldst rise, perchance the very slaves would spare<br/>Their brethren and themselves; great is the strength<br/>Of words--for lately did a maiden fair,<br/>Who from her childhood has been taught to bear<br/>The Tyrant's heaviest yoke, arise, and make<br/>Her sex the law of truth and freedom hear,<br/>And with these quiet words--"for thine own sake<br/>I prithee spare me;"--did with ruth so take<br/><br/>'All hearts, that even the torturer who had bound<br/>Her meek calm frame, ere it was yet impaled,<br/>Loosened her, weeping then; nor could be found<br/>One human hand to harm her--unassailed<br/>Therefore she walks through the great City, veiled<br/>In virtue's adamantine eloquence,<br/>'Gainst scorn, and death and pain thus trebly mailed,<br/>And blending, in the smiles of that defence,<br/>The Serpent and the Dove, Wisdom and Innocence.<br/><br/>'The wild-eyed women throng around her path:<br/>From their luxurious dungeons, from the dust<br/>Of meaner thralls, from the oppressor's wrath,<br/>Or the caresses of his sated lust<br/>They congregate:--in her they put their trust;<br/>The tyrants send their armed slaves to quell<br/>Her power;--they, even like a thunder-gust<br/>Caught by some forest, bend beneath the spell<br/>Of that young maiden's speech, and to their chiefs rebel.<br/><br/>'Thus she doth equal laws and justice teach<br/>To woman, outraged and polluted long;<br/>Gathering the sweetest fruit in human reach<br/>For those fair hands now free, while armed wrong<br/>Trembles before her look, though it be strong;<br/>Thousands thus dwell beside her, virgins bright,<br/>And matrons with their babes, a stately throng!<br/>Lovers renew the vows which they did plight<br/>In early faith, and hearts long parted now unite,<br/><br/>'And homeless orphans find a home near her,<br/>And those poor victims of the proud, no less,<br/>Fair wrecks, on whom the smiling world with stir,<br/>Thrusts the redemption of its wickedness:--<br/>In squalid huts, and in its palaces<br/>Sits Lust alone, while o'er the land is borne<br/>Her voice, whose awful sweetness doth repress<br/>All evil, and her foes relenting turn,<br/>And cast the vote of love in hope's abandoned urn.<br/><br/>'So in the populous City, a young maiden<br/>Has baffled Havoc of the prey which he<br/>Marks as his own, whene'er with chains o'erladen<br/>Men make them arms to hurl down tyranny,--<br/>False arbiter between the bound and free;<br/>And o'er the land, in hamlets and in towns<br/>The multitudes collect tumultuously,<br/>And throng in arms; but tyranny disowns<br/>Their claim, and gathers strength around its trembling thrones.<br/><br/>'Blood soon, although unwillingly, to shed<br/>The free cannot forbear--the Queen of Slaves,<br/>The hoodwinked Angel of the blind and dead,<br/>Custom, with iron mace points to the graves<br/>Where her own standard desolately waves<br/>Over the dust of Prophets and of Kings.<br/>Many yet stand in her array--"she paves<br/>Her path with human hearts," and o'er it flings<br/>The wildering gloom of her immeasurable wings.<br/><br/>'There is a plain beneath the City's wall,<br/>Bounded by misty mountains, wide and vast,<br/>Millions there lift at Freedom's thrilling call<br/>Ten thousand standards wide, they load the blast<br/>Which bears one sound of many voices past,<br/>And startles on his throne their sceptred foe:<br/>He sits amid his idle pomp aghast,<br/>And that his power hath passed away, doth know--<br/>Why pause the victor swords to seal his overthrow?<br/><br/>'The tyrant's guards resistance yet maintain:<br/>Fearless, and fierce, and hard as beasts of blood,<br/>They stand a speck amid the peopled plain;<br/>Carnage and ruin have been made their food<br/>From infancy--ill has become their good,<br/>And for its hateful sake their will has wove<br/>The chains which eat their hearts. The multitude<br/>Surrounding them, with words of human love,<br/>Seek from their own decay their stubborn minds to move.<br/><br/>'Over the land is felt a sudden pause,<br/>As night and day those ruthless bands around,<br/>The watch of love is kept:--a trance which awes<br/>The thoughts of men with hope; as when the sound<br/>Of whirlwind, whose fierce blasts the waves and clouds confound,<br/>Dies suddenly, the mariner in fear<br/>Feels silence sink upon his heart--thus bound,<br/>The conquerors pause, and oh! may freemen ne'er<br/>Clasp the relentless knees of Dread, the murderer!<br/><br/>'If blood be shed, 'tis but a change and choice<br/>Of bonds,--from slavery to cowardice<br/>A wretched fall!--Uplift thy charmed voice!<br/>Pour on those evil men the love that lies<br/>Hovering within those spirit-soothing eyes--<br/>Arise, my friend, farewell!'--As thus he spake,<br/>From the green earth lightly I did arise,<br/>As one out of dim dreams that doth awake,<br/>And looked upon the depth of that reposing lake.<br/><br/>I saw my countenance reflected there;--<br/>And then my youth fell on me like a wind<br/>Descending on still waters--my thin hair<br/>Was prematurely gray, my face was lined<br/>With channels, such as suffering leaves behind,<br/>Not age; my brow was pale, but in my cheek<br/>And lips a flush of gnawing fire did find<br/>Their food and dwelling; though mine eyes might speak<br/>A subtle mind and strong within a frame thus weak.<br/><br/>And though their lustre now was spent and faded,<br/>Yet in my hollow looks and withered mien<br/>The likeness of a shape for which was braided<br/>The brightest woof of genius, still was seen--<br/>One who, methought, had gone from the world's scene,<br/>And left it vacant--'twas her lover's face--<br/>It might resemble her--it once had been<br/>The mirror of her thoughts, and still the grace<br/>Which her mind's shadow cast, left there a lingering trace.<br/><br/>What then was I? She slumbered with the dead.<br/>Glory and joy and peace, had come and gone.<br/>Doth the cloud perish, when the beams are fled<br/>Which steeped its skirts in gold? or, dark and lone,<br/>Doth it not through the paths of night unknown,<br/>On outspread wings of its own wind upborne<br/>Pour rain upon the earth? The stars are shown,<br/>When the cold moon sharpens her silver horn<br/>Under the sea, and make the wide night not forlorn.<br/><br/>Strengthened in heart, yet sad, that aged man<br/>I left, with interchange of looks and tears,<br/>And lingering speech, and to the Camp began<br/>My war. O'er many a mountain-chain which rears<br/>Its hundred crests aloft, my spirit bears<br/>My frame; o'er many a dale and many a moor,<br/>And gaily now meseems serene earth wears<br/>The blosmy spring's star-bright investiture,<br/>A vision which aught sad from sadness might allure.<br/><br/>My powers revived within me, and I went,<br/>As one whom winds waft o'er the bending grass,<br/>Through many a vale of that broad continent.<br/>At night when I reposed, fair dreams did pass<br/>Before my pillow;--my own Cythna was,<br/>Not like a child of death, among them ever;<br/>When I arose from rest, a woful mass<br/>That gentlest sleep seemed from my life to sever,<br/>As if the light of youth were not withdrawn for ever.<br/><br/>Aye as I went, that maiden who had reared<br/>The torch of Truth afar, of whose high deeds<br/>The Hermit in his pilgrimage had heard,<br/>Haunted my thoughts.--Ah, Hope its sickness feeds<br/>With whatsoe'er it finds, or flowers or weeds!<br/>Could she be Cythna?--Was that corpse a shade<br/>Such as self-torturing thought from madness breeds?<br/>Why was this hope not torture? Yet it made<br/>A light around my steps which would not ever fade.<br/><br/>CANTO 5.<br/><br/>Over the utmost hill at length I sped,<br/>A snowy steep:--the moon was hanging low<br/>Over the Asian mountains, and outspread<br/>The plain, the City, and the Camp below,<br/>Skirted the midnight Ocean's glimmering flow;<br/>The City's moonlit spires and myriad lamps,<br/>Like stars in a sublunar sky did glow,<br/>And fires blazed far amid the scattered camps,<br/>Like springs of flame, which burst where'er swift Earthquake stamps.<br/><br/>All slept but those in watchful arms who stood,<br/>And those who sate tending the beacon's light,<br/>And the few sounds from that vast multitude<br/>Made silence more profound.--Oh, what a might<br/>Of human thought was cradled in that night!<br/>How many hearts impenetrably veiled<br/>Beat underneath its shade, what secret fight<br/>Evil and good, in woven passions mailed,<br/>Waged through that silent throng--a war that never failed!<br/><br/>And now the Power of Good held victory.<br/>So, through the labyrinth of many a tent,<br/>Among the silent millions who did lie<br/>In innocent sleep, exultingly I went;<br/>The moon had left Heaven desert now, but lent<br/>From eastern morn the first faint lustre showed<br/>An armed youth--over his spear he bent<br/>His downward face.--'A friend!' I cried aloud,<br/>And quickly common hopes made freemen understood.<br/><br/>I sate beside him while the morning beam<br/>Crept slowly over Heaven, and talked with him<br/>Of those immortal hopes, a glorious theme!<br/>Which led us forth, until the stars grew dim:<br/>And all the while, methought, his voice did swim<br/>As if it drowned in remembrance were<br/>Of thoughts which make the moist eyes overbrim:<br/>At last, when daylight 'gan to fill the air,<br/>He looked on me, and cried in wonder--'Thou art here!'<br/><br/>Then, suddenly, I knew it was the youth<br/>In whom its earliest hopes my spirit found;<br/>But envious tongues had stained his spotless truth,<br/>And thoughtless pride his love in silence bound,<br/>And shame and sorrow mine in toils had wound,<br/>Whilst he was innocent, and I deluded;<br/>The truth now came upon me, on the ground<br/>Tears of repenting joy, which fast intruded,<br/>Fell fast, and o'er its peace our mingling spirits brooded.<br/><br/>Thus, while with rapid lips and earnest eyes<br/>We talked, a sound of sweeping conflict spread<br/>As from the earth did suddenly arise;<br/>From every tent roused by that clamour dread,<br/>Our bands outsprung and seized their arms--we sped<br/>Towards the sound: our tribes were gathering far.<br/>Those sanguine slaves amid ten thousand dead<br/>Stabbed in their sleep, trampled in treacherous war<br/>The gentle hearts whose power their lives had sought to spare.<br/><br/>Like rabid snakes, that sting some gentle child<br/>Who brings them food, when winter false and fair<br/>Allures them forth with its cold smiles, so wild<br/>They rage among the camp;--they overbear<br/>The patriot hosts--confusion, then despair,<br/>Descends like night--when 'Laon!' one did cry;<br/>Like a bright ghost from Heaven that shout did scare<br/>The slaves, and widening through the vaulted sky,<br/>Seemed sent from Earth to Heaven in sign of victory.<br/><br/>In sudden panic those false murderers fled,<br/>Like insect tribes before the northern gale:<br/>But swifter still, our hosts encompassed<br/>Their shattered ranks, and in a craggy vale,<br/>Where even their fierce despair might nought avail,<br/>Hemmed them around!--and then revenge and fear<br/>Made the high virtue of the patriots fail:<br/>One pointed on his foe the mortal spear--<br/>I rushed before its point, and cried 'Forbear, forbear!'<br/><br/>The spear transfixed my arm that was uplifted<br/>In swift expostulation, and the blood<br/>Gushed round its point: I smiled, and--'Oh! thou gifted<br/>With eloquence which shall not be withstood,<br/>Flow thus!' I cried in joy, 'thou vital flood,<br/>Until my heart be dry, ere thus the cause<br/>For which thou wert aught worthy be subdued--<br/>Ah, ye are pale,--ye weep,--your passions pause,--<br/>'Tis well! ye feel the truth of love's benignant laws.<br/><br/>'Soldiers, our brethren and our friends are slain.<br/>Ye murdered them, I think, as they did sleep!<br/>Alas, what have ye done? the slightest pain<br/>Which ye might suffer, there were eyes to weep,<br/>But ye have quenched them--there were smiles to steep<br/>Your hearts in balm, but they are lost in woe;<br/>And those whom love did set his watch to keep<br/>Around your tents, truth's freedom to bestow,<br/>Ye stabbed as they did sleep--but they forgive ye now.<br/><br/>'Oh wherefore should ill ever flow from ill,<br/>And pain still keener pain for ever breed?<br/>We all are brethren--even the slaves who kill<br/>For hire, are men; and to avenge misdeed<br/>On the misdoer, doth but Misery feed<br/>With her own broken heart! O Earth, O Heaven!<br/>And thou, dread Nature, which to every deed<br/>And all that lives, or is, to be hath given,<br/>Even as to thee have these done ill, and are forgiven!<br/><br/>'Join then your hands and hearts, and let the past<br/>Be as a grave which gives not up its dead<br/>To evil thoughts.'--A film then overcast<br/>My sense with dimness, for the wound, which bled<br/>Freshly, swift shadows o'er mine eyes had shed.<br/>When I awoke, I lay mid friends and foes,<br/>And earnest countenances on me shed<br/>The light of questioning looks, whilst one did close<br/>My wound with balmiest herbs, and soothed me to repose;<br/><br/>And one whose spear had pierced me, leaned beside<br/>With quivering lips and humid eyes;--and all<br/>Seemed like some brothers on a journey wide<br/>Gone forth, whom now strange meeting did befall<br/>In a strange land, round one whom they might call<br/>Their friend, their chief, their father, for assay<br/>Of peril, which had saved them from the thrall<br/>Of death, now suffering. Thus the vast array<br/>Of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day.<br/><br/>Lifting the thunder of their acclamation,<br/>Towards the City then the multitude,<br/>And I among them, went in joy--a nation<br/>Made free by love;--a mighty brotherhood<br/>Linked by a jealous interchange of good;<br/>A glorious pageant, more magnificent<br/>Than kingly slaves arrayed in gold and blood,<br/>When they return from carnage, and are sent<br/>In triumph bright beneath the populous battlement.<br/><br/>Afar, the city-walls were thronged on high,<br/>And myriads on each giddy turret clung,<br/>And to each spire far lessening in the sky<br/>Bright pennons on the idle winds were hung;<br/>As we approached, a shout of joyance sprung<br/>At once from all the crowd, as if the vast<br/>And peopled Earth its boundless skies among<br/>The sudden clamour of delight had cast,<br/>When from before its face some general wreck had passed.<br/><br/>Our armies through the City's hundred gates<br/>Were poured, like brooks which to the rocky lair<br/>Of some deep lake, whose silence them awaits,<br/>Throng from the mountains when the storms are there<br/>And, as we passed through the calm sunny air<br/>A thousand flower-inwoven crowns were shed,<br/>The token flowers of truth and freedom fair,<br/>And fairest hands bound them on many a head,<br/>Those angels of love's heaven that over all was spread.<br/><br/>I trod as one tranced in some rapturous vision:<br/>Those bloody bands so lately reconciled,<br/>Were, ever as they went, by the contrition<br/>Of anger turned to love, from ill beguiled,<br/>And every one on them more gently smiled,<br/>Because they had done evil:--the sweet awe<br/>Of such mild looks made their own hearts grow mild,<br/>And did with soft attraction ever draw<br/>Their spirits to the love of freedom's equal law.<br/><br/>And they, and all, in one loud symphony<br/>My name with Liberty commingling, lifted,<br/>'The friend and the preserver of the free!<br/>The parent of this joy!' and fair eyes gifted<br/>With feelings, caught from one who had uplifted<br/>The light of a great spirit, round me shone;<br/>And all the shapes of this grand scenery shifted<br/>Like restless clouds before the steadfast sun,--<br/>Where was that Maid? I asked, but it was known of none.<br/><br/>Laone was the name her love had chosen,<br/>For she was nameless, and her birth none knew:<br/>Where was Laone now?--The words were frozen<br/>Within my lips with fear; but to subdue<br/>Such dreadful hope, to my great task was due,<br/>And when at length one brought reply, that she<br/>To-morrow would appear, I then withdrew<br/>To judge what need for that great throng might be,<br/>For now the stars came thick over the twilight sea.<br/><br/>Yet need was none for rest or food to care,<br/>Even though that multitude was passing great,<br/>Since each one for the other did prepare<br/>All kindly succour--Therefore to the gate<br/>Of the Imperial House, now desolate,<br/>I passed, and there was found aghast, alone,<br/>The fallen Tyrant!--Silently he sate<br/>Upon the footstool of his golden throne,<br/>Which, starred with sunny gems, in its own lustre shone.<br/><br/>Alone, but for one child, who led before him<br/>A graceful dance: the only living thing<br/>Of all the crowd, which thither to adore him<br/>Flocked yesterday, who solace sought to bring<br/>In his abandonment!--She knew the King<br/>Had praised her dance of yore, and now she wove<br/>Its circles, aye weeping and murmuring<br/>Mid her sad task of unregarded love,<br/>That to no smiles it might his speechless sadness move.<br/><br/>She fled to him, and wildly clasped his feet<br/>When human steps were heard:--he moved nor spoke,<br/>Nor changed his hue, nor raised his looks to meet<br/>The gaze of strangers--our loud entrance woke<br/>The echoes of the hall, which circling broke<br/>The calm of its recesses,--like a tomb<br/>Its sculptured walls vacantly to the stroke<br/>Of footfalls answered, and the twilight's gloom<br/>Lay like a charnel's mist within the radiant dome.<br/><br/>The little child stood up when we came nigh;<br/>Her lips and cheeks seemed very pale and wan,<br/>But on her forehead, and within her eye<br/>Lay beauty, which makes hearts that feed thereon<br/>Sick with excess of sweetness; on the throne<br/>She leaned;--the King, with gathered brow, and lips<br/>Wreathed by long scorn, did inly sneer and frown<br/>With hue like that when some great painter dips<br/>His pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse.<br/><br/>She stood beside him like a rainbow braided<br/>Within some storm, when scarce its shadows vast<br/>From the blue paths of the swift sun have faded;<br/>A sweet and solemn smile, like Cythna's, cast<br/>One moment's light, which made my heart beat fast,<br/>O'er that child's parted lips--a gleam of bliss,<br/>A shade of vanished days,--as the tears passed<br/>Which wrapped it, even as with a father's kiss<br/>I pressed those softest eyes in trembling tenderness.<br/><br/>The sceptred wretch then from that solitude<br/>I drew, and, of his change compassionate,<br/>With words of sadness soothed his rugged mood.<br/>But he, while pride and fear held deep debate,<br/>With sullen guile of ill-dissembled hate<br/>Glared on me as a toothless snake might glare:<br/>Pity, not scorn I felt, though desolate<br/>The desolator now, and unaware<br/>The curses which he mocked had caught him by the hair.<br/><br/>I led him forth from that which now might seem<br/>A gorgeous grave: through portals sculptured deep<br/>With imagery beautiful as dream<br/>We went, and left the shades which tend on sleep<br/>Over its unregarded gold to keep<br/>Their silent watch.--The child trod faintingly,<br/>And as she went, the tears which she did weep<br/>Glanced in the starlight; wildered seemed she,<br/>And, when I spake, for sobs she could not answer me.<br/><br/>At last the tyrant cried, 'She hungers, slave!<br/>Stab her, or give her bread!'--It was a tone<br/>Such as sick fancies in a new-made grave<br/>Might hear. I trembled, for the truth was known;<br/>He with this child had thus been left alone,<br/>And neither had gone forth for food,--but he<br/>In mingled pride and awe cowered near his throne,<br/>And she a nursling of captivity<br/>Knew nought beyond those walls, nor what such change might be.<br/><br/>And he was troubled at a charm withdrawn<br/>Thus suddenly; that sceptres ruled no more--<br/>That even from gold the dreadful strength was gone,<br/>Which once made all things subject to its power--<br/>Such wonder seized him, as if hour by hour<br/>The past had come again; and the swift fall<br/>Of one so great and terrible of yore,<br/>To desolateness, in the hearts of all<br/>Like wonder stirred, who saw such awful change befall.<br/><br/>A mighty crowd, such as the wide land pours<br/>Once in a thousand years, now gathered round<br/>The fallen tyrant;--like the rush of showers<br/>Of hail in spring, pattering along the ground,<br/>Their many footsteps fell, else came no sound<br/>From the wide multitude: that lonely man<br/>Then knew the burden of his change, and found,<br/>Concealing in the dust his visage wan,<br/>Refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran.<br/><br/>And he was faint withal: I sate beside him<br/>Upon the earth, and took that child so fair<br/>From his weak arms, that ill might none betide him<br/>Or her;--when food was brought to them, her share<br/>To his averted lips the child did bear,<br/>But, when she saw he had enough, she ate<br/>And wept the while;--the lonely man's despair<br/>Hunger then overcame, and of his state<br/>Forgetful, on the dust as in a trance he sate.<br/><br/>Slowly the silence of the multitudes<br/>Passed, as when far is heard in some lone dell<br/>The gathering of a wind among the woods--<br/>'And he is fallen!' they cry, 'he who did dwell<br/>Like famine or the plague, or aught more fell<br/>Among our homes, is fallen! the murderer<br/>Who slaked his thirsting soul as from a well<br/>Of blood and tears with ruin! he is here!<br/>Sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear!'<br/><br/>Then was heard--'He who judged let him be brought<br/>To judgement! blood for blood cries from the soil<br/>On which his crimes have deep pollution wrought!<br/>Shall Othman only unavenged despoil?<br/>Shall they who by the stress of grinding toil<br/>Wrest from the unwilling earth his luxuries,<br/>Perish for crime, while his foul blood may boil,<br/>Or creep within his veins at will?--Arise!<br/>And to high justice make her chosen sacrifice!'<br/><br/>'What do ye seek? what fear ye,' then I cried,<br/>Suddenly starting forth, 'that ye should shed<br/>The blood of Othman?--if your hearts are tried<br/>In the true love of freedom, cease to dread<br/>This one poor lonely man--beneath Heaven spread<br/>In purest light above us all, through earth--<br/>Maternal earth, who doth her sweet smiles shed<br/>For all, let him go free; until the worth<br/>Of human nature win from these a second birth.<br/><br/>'What call ye "justice"? Is there one who ne'er<br/>In secret thought has wished another's ill?--<br/>Are ye all pure? Let those stand forth who hear<br/>And tremble not. Shall they insult and kill,<br/>If such they be? their mild eyes can they fill<br/>With the false anger of the hypocrite?<br/>Alas, such were not pure!--the chastened will<br/>Of virtue sees that justice is the light<br/>Of love, and not revenge, and terror and despite.'<br/><br/>The murmur of the people, slowly dying,<br/>Paused as I spake, then those who near me were,<br/>Cast gentle looks where the lone man was lying<br/>Shrouding his head, which now that infant fair<br/>Clasped on her lap in silence;--through the air<br/>Sobs were then heard, and many kissed my feet<br/>In pity's madness, and to the despair<br/>Of him whom late they cursed, a solace sweet<br/>His very victims brought--soft looks and speeches meet.<br/><br/>Then to a home for his repose assigned,<br/>Accompanied by the still throng, he went<br/>In silence, where, to soothe his rankling mind,<br/>Some likeness of his ancient state was lent;<br/>And if his heart could have been innocent<br/>As those who pardoned him, he might have ended<br/>His days in peace; but his straight lips were bent,<br/>Men said, into a smile which guile portended,<br/>A sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended.<br/><br/>'Twas midnight now, the eve of that great day<br/>Whereon the many nations at whose call<br/>The chains of earth like mist melted away,<br/>Decreed to hold a sacred Festival,<br/>A rite to attest the equality of all<br/>Who live. So to their homes, to dream or wake<br/>All went. The sleepless silence did recall<br/>Laone to my thoughts, with hopes that make<br/>The flood recede from which their thirst they seek to slake.<br/><br/>The dawn flowed forth, and from its purple fountains<br/>I drank those hopes which make the spirit quail,<br/>As to the plain between the misty mountains<br/>And the great City, with a countenance pale,<br/>I went:--it was a sight which might avail<br/>To make men weep exulting tears, for whom<br/>Now first from human power the reverend veil<br/>Was torn, to see Earth from her general womb<br/>Pour forth her swarming sons to a fraternal doom:<br/><br/>To see, far glancing in the misty morning,<br/>The signs of that innumerable host;<br/>To hear one sound of many made, the warning<br/>Of Earth to Heaven from its free children tossed,<br/>While the eternal hills, and the sea lost<br/>In wavering light, and, starring the blue sky<br/>The city's myriad spires of gold, almost<br/>With human joy made mute society--<br/>Its witnesses with men who must hereafter be.<br/><br/>To see, like some vast island from the Ocean,<br/>The Altar of the Federation rear<br/>Its pile i' the midst; a work, which the devotion<br/>Of millions in one night created there,<br/>Sudden as when the moonrise makes appear<br/>Strange clouds in the east; a marble pyramid<br/>Distinct with steps: that mighty shape did wear<br/>The light of genius; its still shadow hid<br/>Far ships: to know its height the morning mists forbid!<br/><br/>To hear the restless multitudes for ever<br/>Around the base of that great Altar flow,<br/>As on some mountain-islet burst and shiver<br/>Atlantic waves; and solemnly and slow<br/>As the wind bore that tumult to and fro,<br/>To feel the dreamlike music, which did swim<br/>Like beams through floating clouds on waves below<br/>Falling in pauses, from that Altar dim,<br/>As silver-sounding tongues breathed an aerial hymn.<br/><br/>To hear, to see, to live, was on that morn<br/>Lethean joy! so that all those assembled<br/>Cast off their memories of the past outworn;<br/>Two only bosoms with their own life trembled,<br/>And mine was one,--and we had both dissembled;<br/>So with a beating heart I went, and one,<br/>Who having much, covets yet more, resembled;<br/>A lost and dear possession, which not won,<br/>He walks in lonely gloom beneath the noonday sun.<br/><br/>To the great Pyramid I came: its stair<br/>With female choirs was thronged: the loveliest<br/>Among the free, grouped with its sculptures rare;<br/>As I approached, the morning's golden mist,<br/>Which now the wonder-stricken breezes kissed<br/>With their cold lips, fled, and the summit shone<br/>Like Athos seen from Samothracia, dressed<br/>In earliest light, by vintagers, and one<br/>Sate there, a female Shape upon an ivory throne:<br/><br/>A Form most like the imagined habitant<br/>Of silver exhalations sprung from dawn,<br/>By winds which feed on sunrise woven, to enchant<br/>The faiths of men: all mortal eyes were drawn,<br/>As famished mariners through strange seas gone<br/>Gaze on a burning watch-tower, by the light<br/>Of those divinest lineaments--alone<br/>With thoughts which none could share, from that fair sight<br/>I turned in sickness, for a veil shrouded her countenance bright.<br/><br/>And neither did I hear the acclamations,<br/>Which from brief silence bursting, filled the air<br/>With her strange name and mine, from all the nations<br/>Which we, they said, in strength had gathered there<br/>From the sleep of bondage; nor the vision fair<br/>Of that bright pageantry beheld,--but blind<br/>And silent, as a breathing corpse did fare,<br/>Leaning upon my friend, till like a wind<br/>To fevered cheeks, a voice flowed o'er my troubled mind.<br/><br/>Like music of some minstrel heavenly gifted,<br/>To one whom fiends enthral, this voice to me;<br/>Scarce did I wish her veil to be uplifted,<br/>I was so calm and joyous.--I could see<br/>The platform where we stood, the statues three<br/>Which kept their marble watch on that high shrine,<br/>The multitudes, the mountains, and the sea;<br/>As when eclipse hath passed, things sudden shine<br/>To men's astonished eyes most clear and crystalline.<br/><br/>At first Laone spoke most tremulously:<br/>But soon her voice the calmness which it shed<br/>Gathered, and--'Thou art whom I sought to see,<br/>And thou art our first votary here,' she said:<br/>'I had a dear friend once, but he is dead!--<br/>And of all those on the wide earth who breathe,<br/>Thou dost resemble him alone--I spread<br/>This veil between us two that thou beneath<br/>Shouldst image one who may have been long lost in death.<br/><br/>'For this wilt thou not henceforth pardon me?<br/>Yes, but those joys which silence well requite<br/>Forbid reply;--why men have chosen me<br/>To be the Priestess of this holiest rite<br/>I scarcely know, but that the floods of light<br/>Which flow over the world, have borne me hither<br/>To meet thee, long most dear; and now unite<br/>Thine hand with mine, and may all comfort wither<br/>From both the hearts whose pulse in joy now beat together,<br/><br/>'If our own will as others' law we bind,<br/>If the foul worship trampled here we fear;<br/>If as ourselves we cease to love our kind!'--<br/>She paused, and pointed upwards--sculptured there<br/>Three shapes around her ivory throne appear;<br/>One was a Giant, like a child asleep<br/>On a loose rock, whose grasp crushed, as it were<br/>In dream, sceptres and crowns; and one did keep<br/>Its watchful eyes in doubt whether to smile or weep;<br/><br/>A Woman sitting on the sculptured disk<br/>Of the broad earth, and feeding from one breast<br/>A human babe and a young basilisk;<br/>Her looks were sweet as Heaven's when loveliest<br/>In Autumn eves. The third Image was dressed<br/>In white wings swift as clouds in winter skies;<br/>Beneath his feet, 'mongst ghastliest forms, repressed<br/>Lay Faith, an obscene worm, who sought to rise,<br/>While calmly on the Sun he turned his diamond eyes.<br/><br/>Beside that Image then I sate, while she<br/>Stood, mid the throngs which ever ebbed and flowed,<br/>Like light amid the shadows of the sea<br/>Cast from one cloudless star, and on the crowd<br/>That touch which none who feels forgets, bestowed;<br/>And whilst the sun returned the steadfast gaze<br/>Of the great Image, as o'er Heaven it glode,<br/>That rite had place; it ceased when sunset's blaze<br/>Burned o'er the isles. All stood in joy and deep amaze--<br/>--When in the silence of all spirits there<br/>Laone's voice was felt, and through the air<br/>Her thrilling gestures spoke, most eloquently fair:--<br/><br/>51.1.<br/>'Calm art thou as yon sunset! swift and strong<br/>As new-fledged Eagles, beautiful and young,<br/>That float among the blinding beams of morning;<br/>And underneath thy feet writhe Faith, and Folly,<br/>Custom, and Hell, and mortal Melancholy--<br/>Hark! the Earth starts to hear the mighty warning<br/>Of thy voice sublime and holy;<br/>Its free spirits here assembled<br/>See thee, feel thee, know thee now,--<br/>To thy voice their hearts have trembled<br/>Like ten thousand clouds which flow<br/>With one wide wind as it flies!--<br/>Wisdom! thy irresistible children rise<br/>To hail thee, and the elements they chain<br/>And their own will, to swell the glory of thy train.<br/><br/>51.2.<br/>'O Spirit vast and deep as Night and Heaven!<br/>Mother and soul of all to which is given<br/>The light of life, the loveliness of being,<br/>Lo! thou dost re-ascend the human heart,<br/>Thy throne of power, almighty as thou wert<br/>In dreams of Poets old grown pale by seeing<br/>The shade of thee;--now, millions start<br/>To feel thy lightnings through them burning:<br/>Nature, or God, or Love, or Pleasure,<br/>Or Sympathy the sad tears turning<br/>To mutual smiles, a drainless treasure,<br/>Descends amidst us;--Scorn and Hate,<br/>Revenge and Selfishness are desolate--<br/>A hundred nations swear that there shall be<br/>Pity and Peace and Love, among the good and free!<br/><br/>51.3.<br/>'Eldest of things, divine Equality!<br/>Wisdom and Love are but the slaves of thee,<br/>The Angels of thy sway, who pour around thee<br/>Treasures from all the cells of human thought,<br/>And from the Stars, and from the Ocean brought,<br/>And the last living heart whose beatings bound thee:<br/>The powerful and the wise had sought<br/>Thy coming, thou in light descending<br/>O'er the wide land which is thine own<br/>Like the Spring whose breath is blending<br/>All blasts of fragrance into one,<br/>Comest upon the paths of men!--<br/>Earth bares her general bosom to thy ken,<br/>And all her children here in glory meet<br/>To feed upon thy smiles, and clasp thy sacred feet.<br/><br/>51.4<br/>'My brethren, we are free! the plains and mountains,<br/>The gray sea-shore, the forests and the fountains,<br/>Are haunts of happiest dwellers;--man and woman,<br/>Their common bondage burst, may freely borrow<br/>From lawless love a solace for their sorrow;<br/>For oft we still must weep, since we are human.<br/>A stormy night's serenest morrow,<br/>Whose showers are pity's gentle tears,<br/>Whose clouds are smiles of those that die<br/>Like infants without hopes or fears,<br/>And whose beams are joys that lie<br/>In blended hearts, now holds dominion;<br/>The dawn of mind, which upwards on a pinion<br/>Borne, swift as sunrise, far illumines space,<br/>And clasps this barren world in its own bright embrace!<br/><br/>51.5<br/>'My brethren, we are free!

Victory! Earth's remotest shore,<br/>Regions which groan beneath the Antarctic stars,<br/>The green lands cradled in the roar<br/>Of western waves, and wildernesses<br/>Peopled and vast, which skirt the oceans<br/>Where morning dyes her golden tresses,<br/>Shall soon partake our high emotions:<br/>Kings shall turn pale! Almighty Fear,<br/>The Fiend-God, when our charmed name he hear,<br/>Shall fade like shadow from his thousand fanes,<br/>While Truth with Joy enthroned o'er his lost empire reigns!'<br/><br/>51.52.<br/>Ere she had ceased, the mists of night entwining<br/>Their dim woof, floated o'er the infinite throng;<br/>She, like a spirit through the darkness shining,<br/>In tones whose sweetness silence did prolong,<br/>As if to lingering winds they did belong,<br/>Poured forth her inmost soul: a passionate speech<br/>With wild and thrilling pauses woven among,<br/>Which whoso heard was mute, for it could teach<br/>To rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach.<br/><br/>Her voice was as a mountain stream which sweeps<br/>The withered leaves of Autumn to the lake,<br/>And in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps<br/>In the shadow of the shores; as dead leaves wake,<br/>Under the wave, in flowers and herbs which make<br/>Those green depths beautiful when skies are blue,<br/>The multitude so moveless did partake<br/>Such living change, and kindling murmurs flew<br/>As o'er that speechless calm delight and wonder grew.<br/><br/>Over the plain the throngs were scattered then<br/>In groups around the fires, which from the sea<br/>Even to the gorge of the first mountain-glen<br/>Blazed wide and far: the banquet of the free<br/>Was spread beneath many a dark cypress-tree,<br/>Beneath whose spires, which swayed in the red flame,<br/>Reclining, as they ate, of Liberty,<br/>And Hope, and Justice, and Laone's name,<br/>Earth's children did a woof of happy converse frame.<br/><br/>Their feast was such as Earth, the general mother,<br/>Pours from her fairest bosom, when she smiles<br/>In the embrace of Autumn;--to each other<br/>As when some parent fondly reconciles<br/>Her warring children, she their wrath beguiles<br/>With her own sustenance, they relenting weep:<br/>Such was this Festival, which from their isles<br/>And continents, and winds, and oceans deep,<br/>All shapes might throng to share, that fly, or walk or creep,--<br/><br/>Might share in peace and innocence, for gore<br/>Or poison none this festal did pollute,<br/>But, piled on high, an overflowing store<br/>Of pomegranates and citrons, fairest fruit,<br/>Melons, and dates, and figs, and many a root<br/>Sweet and sustaining, and bright grapes ere yet<br/>Accursed fire their mild juice could transmute<br/>Into a mortal bane, and brown corn set<br/>In baskets; with pure streams their thirsting lips they wet.<br/><br/>Laone had descended from the shrine,<br/>And every deepest look and holiest mind<br/>Fed on her form, though now those tones divine<br/>Were silent as she passed; she did unwind<br/>Her veil, as with the crowds of her own kind<br/>She mixed; some impulse made my heart refrain<br/>From seeking her that night, so I reclined<br/>Amidst a group, where on the utmost plain<br/>A festal watchfire burned beside the dusky main.<br/><br/>And joyous was our feast; pathetic talk,<br/>And wit, and harmony of choral strains,<br/>While far Orion o'er the waves did walk<br/>That flow among the isles, held us in chains<br/>Of sweet captivity which none disdains<br/>Who feels; but when his zone grew dim in mist<br/>Which clothes the Ocean's bosom, o'er the plains<br/>The multitudes went homeward, to their rest,<br/>Which that delightful day with its own shadow blessed.<br/><br/>CANTO 6.<br/><br/>Beside the dimness of the glimmering sea,<br/>Weaving swift language from impassioned themes,<br/>With that dear friend I lingered, who to me<br/>So late had been restored, beneath the gleams<br/>Of the silver stars; and ever in soft dreams<br/>Of future love and peace sweet converse lapped<br/>Our willing fancies, till the pallid beams<br/>Of the last watchfire fell, and darkness wrapped<br/>The waves, and each bright chain of floating fire was snapped;<br/><br/>And till we came even to the City's wall<br/>And the great gate; then, none knew whence or why,<br/>Disquiet on the multitudes did fall:<br/>And first, one pale and breathless passed us by,<br/>And stared and spoke not;--then with piercing cry<br/>A troop of wild-eyed women, by the shrieks<br/>Of their own terror driven,--tumultuously<br/>Hither and thither hurrying with pale cheeks,<br/>Each one from fear unknown a sudden refuge seeks--<br/><br/>Then, rallying cries of treason and of danger<br/>Resounded: and--'They come! to arms! to arms!<br/>The Tyrant is amongst us, and the stranger<br/>Comes to enslave us in his name! to arms!'<br/>In vain: for Panic, the pale fiend who charms<br/>Strength to forswear her right, those millions swept<br/>Like waves before the tempest--these alarms<br/>Came to me, as to know their cause I lept<br/>On the gate's turret, and in rage and grief and scorn I wept!<br/><br/>For to the North I saw the town on fire,<br/>And its red light made morning pallid now,<br/>Which burst over wide Asia;--louder, higher,<br/>The yells of victory and the screams of woe<br/>I heard approach, and saw the throng below<br/>Stream through the gates like foam-wrought waterfalls<br/>Fed from a thousand storms--the fearful glow<br/>Of bombs flares overhead--at intervals<br/>The red artillery's bolt mangling among them falls.<br/><br/>And now the horsemen come--and all was done<br/>Swifter than I have spoken--I beheld<br/>Their red swords flash in the unrisen sun.<br/>I rushed among the rout, to have repelled<br/>That miserable flight--one moment quelled<br/>By voice and looks and eloquent despair,<br/>As if reproach from their own hearts withheld<br/>Their steps, they stood; but soon came pouring there<br/>New multitudes, and did those rallied bands o'erbear.<br/><br/>I strove, as, drifted on some cataract<br/>By irresistible streams, some wretch might strive<br/>Who hears its fatal roar:--the files compact<br/>Whelmed me, and from the gate availed to drive<br/>With quickening impulse, as each bolt did rive<br/>Their ranks with bloodier chasm:--into the plain<br/>Disgorged at length the dead and the alive<br/>In one dread mass, were parted, and the stain<br/>Of blood, from mortal steel fell o'er the fields like rain.<br/><br/>For now the despot's bloodhounds with their prey<br/>Unarmed and unaware, were gorging deep<br/>Their gluttony of death; the loose array<br/>Of horsemen o'er the wide fields murdering sweep,<br/>And with loud laughter for their tyrant reap<br/>A harvest sown with other hopes; the while,<br/>Far overhead, ships from Propontis keep<br/>A killing rain of fire:--when the waves smile<br/>As sudden earthquakes light many a volcano-isle,<br/><br/>Thus sudden, unexpected feast was spread<br/>For the carrion-fowls of Heaven.--I saw the sight--<br/>I moved--I lived--as o'er the heaps of dead,<br/>Whose stony eyes glared in the morning light<br/>I trod;--to me there came no thought of flight,<br/>But with loud cries of scorn, which whoso heard<br/>That dreaded death, felt in his veins the might<br/>Of virtuous shame return, the crowd I stirred,<br/>And desperation's hope in many hearts recurred.<br/><br/>A band of brothers gathering round me, made,<br/>Although unarmed, a steadfast front, and still<br/>Retreating, with stern looks beneath the shade<br/>Of gathered eyebrows, did the victors fill<br/>With doubt even in success; deliberate will<br/>Inspired our growing troop; not overthrown<br/>It gained the shelter of a grassy hill,<br/>And ever still our comrades were hewn down,<br/>And their defenceless limbs beneath our footsteps strown.<br/><br/>Immovably we stood--in joy I found,<br/>Beside me then, firm as a giant pine<br/>Among the mountain-vapours driven around,<br/>The old man whom I loved--his eyes divine<br/>With a mild look of courage answered mine,<br/>And my young friend was near, and ardently<br/>His hand grasped mine a moment--now the line<br/>Of war extended, to our rallying cry<br/>As myriads flocked in love and brotherhood to die.<br/><br/>For ever while the sun was climbing Heaven<br/>The horseman hewed our unarmed myriads down<br/>Safely, though when by thirst of carnage driven<br/>Too near, those slaves were swiftly overthrown<br/>By hundreds leaping on them:--flesh and bone<br/>Soon made our ghastly ramparts; then the shaft<br/>Of the artillery from the sea was thrown<br/>More fast and fiery, and the conquerors laughed<br/>In pride to hear the wind our screams of torment waft.<br/><br/>For on one side alone the hill gave shelter,<br/>So vast that phalanx of unconquered men,<br/>And there the living in the blood did welter<br/>Of the dead and dying, which in that green glen,<br/>Like stifled torrents, made a plashy fen<br/>Under the feet--thus was the butchery waged<br/>While the sun clomb Heaven's eastern steep--but when<br/>It 'gan to sink--a fiercer combat raged,<br/>For in more doubtful strife the armies were engaged.<br/><br/>Within a cave upon the hill were found<br/>A bundle of rude pikes, the instrument<br/>Of those who war but on their native ground<br/>For natural rights: a shout of joyance sent<br/>Even from our hearts the wide air pierced and rent,<br/>As those few arms the bravest and the best<br/>Seized, and each sixth, thus armed, did now present<br/>A line which covered and sustained the rest,<br/>A confident phalanx, which the foes on every side invest.<br/><br/>That onset turned the foes to flight almost;<br/>But soon they saw their present strength, and knew<br/>That coming night would to our resolute host<br/>Bring victory; so dismounting, close they drew<br/>Their glittering files, and then the combat grew<br/>Unequal but most horrible;--and ever<br/>Our myriads, whom the swift bolt overthrew,<br/>Or the red sword, failed like a mountain river<br/>Which rushes forth in foam to sink in sands for ever.<br/><br/>Sorrow and shame, to see with their own kind<br/>Our human brethren mix, like beasts of blood,<br/>To mutual ruin armed by one behind<br/>Who sits and scoffs!--That friend so mild and good,<br/>Who like its shadow near my youth had stood,<br/>Was stabbed!--my old preserver's hoary hair<br/>With the flesh clinging to its roots, was strewed<br/>Under my feet!--I lost all sense or care,<br/>And like the rest I grew desperate and unaware.<br/><br/>The battle became ghastlier--in the midst<br/>I paused, and saw, how ugly and how fell<br/>O Hate! thou art, even when thy life thou shedd'st<br/>For love. The ground in many a little dell<br/>Was broken, up and down whose steeps befell<br/>Alternate victory and defeat, and there<br/>The combatants with rage most horrible<br/>Strove, and their eyes started with cracking stare,<br/>And impotent their tongues they lolled into the air,<br/><br/>Flaccid and foamy, like a mad dog's hanging;<br/>Want, and Moon-madness, and the pest's swift Bane<br/>When its shafts smite--while yet its bow is twanging--<br/>Have each their mark and sign--some ghastly stain;<br/>And this was thine, O War! of hate and pain<br/>Thou loathed slave! I saw all shapes of death<br/>And ministered to many, o'er the plain<br/>While carnage in the sunbeam's warmth did seethe,<br/>Till twilight o'er the east wove her serenest wreath.<br/><br/>The few who yet survived, resolute and firm<br/>Around me fought. At the decline of day<br/>Winding above the mountain's snowy term<br/>New banners shone; they quivered in the ray<br/>Of the sun's unseen orb--ere night the array<br/>Of fresh troops hemmed us in--of those brave bands<br/>I soon survived alone--and now I lay<br/>Vanquished and faint, the grasp of bloody hands<br/>I felt, and saw on high the glare of falling brands,<br/><br/>When on my foes a sudden terror came,<br/>And they fled, scattering--lo! with reinless speed<br/>A black Tartarian horse of giant frame<br/>Comes trampling over the dead, the living bleed<br/>Beneath the hoofs of that tremendous steed,<br/>On which, like to an Angel, robed in white,<br/>Sate one waving a sword;--the hosts recede<br/>And fly, as through their ranks with awful might,<br/>Sweeps in the shadow of eve that Phantom swift and bright;<br/><br/>And its path made a solitude.--I rose<br/>And marked its coming: it relaxed its course<br/>As it approached me, and the wind that flows<br/>Through night, bore accents to mine ear whose force<br/>Might create smiles in death--the Tartar horse<br/>Paused, and I saw the shape its might which swayed,<br/>And heard her musical pants, like the sweet source<br/>Of waters in the desert, as she said,<br/>'Mount with me, Laon, now'--I rapidly obeyed.<br/><br/>Then: 'Away! away!' she cried, and stretched her sword<br/>As 'twere a scourge over the courser's head,<br/>And lightly shook the reins.--We spake no word,<br/>But like the vapour of the tempest fled<br/>Over the plain; her dark hair was dispread<br/>Like the pine's locks upon the lingering blast;<br/>Over mine eyes its shadowy strings it spread<br/>Fitfully, and the hills and streams fled fast,<br/>As o'er their glimmering forms the steed's broad shadow passed.<br/><br/>And his hoofs ground the rocks to fire and dust,<br/>His strong sides made the torrents rise in spray,<br/>And turbulence, as of a whirlwind's gust<br/>Surrounded us;--and still away! away!<br/>Through the desert night we sped, while she alway<br/>Gazed on a mountain which we neared, whose crest,<br/>Crowned with a marble ruin, in the ray<br/>Of the obscure stars gleamed;--its rugged breast<br/>The steed strained up, and then his impulse did arrest.<br/><br/>A rocky hill which overhung the Ocean:--<br/>From that lone ruin, when the steed that panted<br/>Paused, might be heard the murmur of the motion<br/>Of waters, as in spots for ever haunted<br/>By the choicest winds of Heaven, which are enchanted<br/>To music, by the wand of Solitude,<br/>That wizard wild, and the far tents implanted<br/>Upon the plain, be seen by those who stood<br/>Thence marking the dark shore of Ocean's curved flood.<br/><br/>One moment these were heard and seen--another<br/>Passed; and the two who stood beneath that night,<br/>Each only heard, or saw, or felt the other;<br/>As from the lofty steed she did alight,<br/>Cythna, (for, from the eyes whose deepest light<br/>Of love and sadness made my lips feel pale<br/>With influence strange of mournfullest delight,<br/>My own sweet Cythna looked), with joy did quail,<br/>And felt her strength in tears of human weakness fail.<br/><br/>And for a space in my embrace she rested,<br/>Her head on my unquiet heart reposing,<br/>While my faint arms her languid frame invested;<br/>At length she looked on me, and half unclosing<br/>Her tremulous lips, said, 'Friend, thy bands were losing<br/>The battle, as I stood before the King<br/>In bonds.--I burst them then, and swiftly choosing<br/>The time, did seize a Tartar's sword, and spring<br/>Upon his horse, and swift, as on the whirlwind's wing,<br/><br/>'Have thou and I been borne beyond pursuer,<br/>And we are here.'--Then, turning to the steed,<br/>She pressed the white moon on his front with pure<br/>And rose-like lips, and many a fragrant weed<br/>From the green ruin plucked, that he might feed;--<br/>But I to a stone seat that Maiden led,<br/>And, kissing her fair eyes, said, 'Thou hast need<br/>Of rest,' and I heaped up the courser's bed<br/>In a green mossy nook, with mountain flowers dispread.<br/><br/>Within that ruin, where a shattered portal<br/>Looks to the eastern stars, abandoned now<br/>By man, to be the home of things immortal,<br/>Memories, like awful ghosts which come and go,<br/>And must inherit all he builds below,<br/>When he is gone, a hall stood; o'er whose roof<br/>Fair clinging weeds with ivy pale did grow,<br/>Clasping its gray rents with a verdurous woof,<br/>A hanging dome of leaves, a canopy moon-proof.<br/><br/>The autumnal winds, as if spell-bound, had made<br/>A natural couch of leaves in that recess,<br/>Which seasons none disturbed, but, in the shade<br/>Of flowering parasites, did Spring love to dress<br/>With their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness<br/>Of those dead leaves, shedding their stars, whene'er<br/>The wandering wind her nurslings might caress;<br/>Whose intertwining fingers ever there<br/>Made music wild and soft that filled the listening air.<br/><br/>We know not where we go, or what sweet dream<br/>May pilot us through caverns strange and fair<br/>Of far and pathless passion, while the stream<br/>Of life, our bark doth on its whirlpools bear,<br/>Spreading swift wings as sails to the dim air;<br/>Nor should we seek to know, so the devotion<br/>Of love and gentle thoughts be heard still there<br/>Louder and louder from the utmost Ocean<br/>Of universal life, attuning its commotion.<br/><br/>To the pure all things are pure! Oblivion wrapped<br/>Our spirits, and the fearful overthrow<br/>Of public hope was from our being snapped,<br/>Though linked years had bound it there; for now<br/>A power, a thirst, a knowledge, which below<br/>All thoughts, like light beyond the atmosphere,<br/>Clothing its clouds with grace, doth ever flow,<br/>Came on us, as we sate in silence there,<br/>Beneath the golden stars of the clear azure air;--<br/><br/>In silence which doth follow talk that causes<br/>The baffled heart to speak with sighs and tears,<br/>When wildering passion swalloweth up the pauses<br/>Of inexpressive speech:--the youthful years<br/>Which we together passed, their hopes and fears,<br/>The blood itself which ran within our frames,<br/>That likeness of the features which endears<br/>The thoughts expressed by them, our very names,<br/>And all the winged hours which speechless memory claims,<br/><br/>Had found a voice--and ere that voice did pass,<br/>The night grew damp and dim, and, through a rent<br/>Of the ruin where we sate, from the morass<br/>A wandering Meteor by some wild wind sent,<br/>Hung high in the green dome, to which it lent<br/>A faint and pallid lustre; while the song<br/>Of blasts, in which its blue hair quivering bent,<br/>Strewed strangest sounds the moving leaves among;<br/>A wondrous light, the sound as of a spirit's tongue.<br/><br/>The Meteor showed the leaves on which we sate,<br/>And Cythna's glowing arms, and the thick ties<br/>Of her soft hair, which bent with gathered weight<br/>My neck near hers; her dark and deepening eyes,<br/>Which, as twin phantoms of one star that lies<br/>O'er a dim well, move, though the star reposes,<br/>Swam in our mute and liquid ecstasies,<br/>Her marble brow, and eager lips, like roses,<br/>With their own fragrance pale, which Spring but half uncloses.<br/><br/>The Meteor to its far morass returned:<br/>The beating of our veins one interval<br/>Made still; and then I felt the blood that burned<br/>Within her frame, mingle with mine, and fall<br/>Around my heart like fire; and over all<br/>A mist was spread, the sickness of a deep<br/>And speechless swoon of joy, as might befall<br/>Two disunited spirits when they leap<br/>In union from this earth's obscure and fading sleep.<br/><br/>Was it one moment that confounded thus<br/>All thought, all sense, all feeling, into one<br/>Unutterable power, which shielded us<br/>Even from our own cold looks, when we had gone<br/>Into a wide and wild oblivion<br/>Of tumult and of tenderness? or now<br/>Had ages, such as make the moon and sun,<br/>The seasons, and mankind their changes know,<br/>Left fear and time unfelt by us alone below?<br/><br/>I know not. What are kisses whose fire clasps<br/>The failing heart in languishment, or limb<br/>Twined within limb? or the quick dying gasps<br/>Of the life meeting, when the faint eyes swim<br/>Through tears of a wide mist boundless and dim,<br/>In one caress? What is the strong control<br/>Which leads the heart that dizzy steep to climb,<br/>Where far over the world those vapours roll<br/>Which blend two restless frames in one reposing soul?<br/><br/>It is the shadow which doth float unseen,<br/>But not unfelt, o'er blind mortality,<br/>Whose divine darkness fled not from that green<br/>And lone recess, where lapped in peace did lie<br/>Our linked frames, till, from the changing sky<br/>That night and still another day had fled;<br/>And then I saw and felt. The moon was high,<br/>And clouds, as of a coming storm, were spread<br/>Under its orb,--loud winds were gathering overhead.<br/><br/>Cythna's sweet lips seemed lurid in the moon,<br/>Her fairest limbs with the night wind were chill,<br/>And her dark tresses were all loosely strewn<br/>O'er her pale bosom:--all within was still,<br/>And the sweet peace of joy did almost fill<br/>The depth of her unfathomable look;--<br/>And we sate calmly, though that rocky hill,<br/>The waves contending in its caverns strook,<br/>For they foreknew the storm, and the gray ruin shook.<br/><br/>There we unheeding sate, in the communion<br/>Of interchanged vows, which, with a rite<br/>Of faith most sweet and sacred, stamped our union.--<br/>Few were the living hearts which could unite<br/>Like ours, or celebrate a bridal night<br/>With such close sympathies, for they had sprung<br/>From linked youth, and from the gentle might<br/>Of earliest love, delayed and cherished long,<br/>Which common hopes and fears made, like a tempest, strong.<br/><br/>And such is Nature's law divine, that those<br/>Who grow together cannot choose but love,<br/>If faith or custom do not interpose,<br/>Or common slavery mar what else might move<br/>All gentlest thoughts; as in the sacred grove<br/>Which shades the springs of Ethiopian Nile,<br/>That living tree which, if the arrowy dove<br/>Strike with her shadow, shrinks in fear awhile,<br/>But its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile;<br/><br/>And clings to them, when darkness may dissever<br/>The close caresses of all duller plants<br/>Which bloom on the wide earth--thus we for ever<br/>Were linked, for love had nursed us in the haunts<br/>Where knowledge, from its secret source enchants<br/>Young hearts with the fresh music of its springing,<br/>Ere yet its gathered flood feeds human wants,<br/>As the great Nile feeds Egypt; ever flinging<br/>Light on the woven boughs which o'er its waves are swinging.<br/><br/>The tones of Cythna's voice like echoes were<br/>Of those far murmuring streams; they rose and fell,<br/>Mixed with mine own in the tempestuous air,--<br/>And so we sate, until our talk befell<br/>Of the late ruin, swift and horrible,<br/>And how those seeds of hope might yet be sown,<br/>Whose fruit is evil's mortal poison: well,<br/>For us, this ruin made a watch-tower lone,<br/>But Cythna's eyes looked faint, and now two days were gone<br/><br/>Since she had food:--therefore I did awaken<br/>The Tartar steed, who, from his ebon mane<br/>Soon as the clinging slumbers he had shaken,<br/>Bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein,<br/>Following me obediently; with pain<br/>Of heart, so deep and dread, that one caress,<br/>When lips and heart refuse to part again<br/>Till they have told their fill, could scarce express<br/>The anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness,<br/><br/>Cythna beheld me part, as I bestrode<br/>That willing steed--the tempest and the night,<br/>Which gave my path its safety as I rode<br/>Down the ravine of rocks, did soon unite<br/>The darkness and the tumult of their might<br/>Borne on all winds.--Far through the streaming rain<br/>Floating at intervals the garments white<br/>Of Cythna gleamed, and her voice once again<br/>Came to me on the gust, and soon I reached the plain.<br/><br/>I dreaded not the tempest, nor did he<br/>Who bore me, but his eyeballs wide and red<br/>Turned on the lightning's cleft exultingly;<br/>And when the earth beneath his tameless tread,<br/>Shook with the sullen thunder, he would spread<br/>His nostrils to the blast, and joyously<br/>Mock the fierce peal with neighings;--thus we sped<br/>O'er the lit plain, and soon I could descry<br/>Where Death and Fire had gorged the spoil of victory.<br/><br/>There was a desolate village in a wood<br/>Whose bloom-inwoven leaves now scattering fed<br/>The hungry storm; it was a place of blood,<br/>A heap of hearthless walls;--the flames were dead<br/>Within those dwellings now,--the life had fled<br/>From all those corpses now,--but the wide sky<br/>Flooded with lightning was ribbed overhead<br/>By the black rafters, and around did lie<br/>Women, and babes, and men, slaughtered confusedly.<br/><br/>Beside the fountain in the market-place<br/>Dismounting, I beheld those corpses stare<br/>With horny eyes upon each other's face,<br/>And on the earth and on the vacant air,<br/>And upon me, close to the waters where<br/>I stooped to slake my thirst;--I shrank to taste,<br/>For the salt bitterness of blood was there;<br/>But tied the steed beside, and sought in haste<br/>If any yet survived amid that ghastly waste.<br/><br/>No living thing was there beside one woman,<br/>Whom I found wandering in the streets, and she<br/>Was withered from a likeness of aught human<br/>Into a fiend, by some strange misery:<br/>Soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me,<br/>And glued her burning lips to mine, and laughed<br/>With a loud, long, and frantic laugh of glee,<br/>And cried, 'Now, Mortal, thou hast deeply quaffed<br/>The Plague's blue kisses--soon millions shall pledge the draught!<br/><br/>'My name is Pestilence--this bosom dry,<br/>Once fed two babes--a sister and a brother--<br/>When I came home, one in the blood did lie<br/>Of three death-wounds--the flames had ate the other!<br/>Since then I have no longer been a mother,<br/>But I am Pestilence;--hither and thither<br/>I flit about, that I may slay and smother:--<br/>All lips which I have kissed must surely wither,<br/>But Death's--if thou art he, we'll go to work together!<br/><br/>'What seek'st thou here? The moonlight comes in flashes,--<br/>The dew is rising dankly from the dell--<br/>'Twill moisten her! and thou shalt see the gashes<br/>In my sweet boy, now full of worms--but tell<br/>First what thou seek'st.'--'I seek for food.'--''Tis well,<br/>Thou shalt have food. Famine, my paramour,<br/>Waits for us at the feast--cruel and fell<br/>Is Famine, but he drives not from his door<br/>Those whom these lips have kissed, alone. No more, no more!'<br/><br/>As thus she spake, she grasped me with the strength<br/>Of madness, and by many a ruined hearth<br/>She led, and over many a corpse:--at length<br/>We came to a lone hut where on the earth<br/>Which made its floor, she in her ghastly mirth,<br/>Gathering from all those homes now desolate,<br/>Had piled three heaps of loaves, making a dearth<br/>Among the dead--round which she set in state<br/>A ring of cold, stiff babes; silent and stark they sate.<br/><br/>She leaped upon a pile, and lifted high<br/>Her mad looks to the lightning, and cried: 'Eat!<br/>Share the great feast--to-morrow we must die!'<br/>And then she spurned the loaves with her pale feet,<br/>Towards her bloodless guests;--that sight to meet,<br/>Mine eyes and my heart ached, and but that she<br/>Who loved me, did with absent looks defeat<br/>Despair, I might have raved in sympathy;<br/>But now I took the food that woman offered me;<br/><br/>And vainly having with her madness striven<br/>If I might win her to return with me,<br/>Departed. In the eastern beams of Heaven<br/>The lightning now grew pallid--rapidly,<br/>As by the shore of the tempestuous sea<br/>The dark steed bore me; and the mountain gray<br/>Soon echoed to his hoofs, and I could see<br/>Cythna among the rocks, where she alway<br/>Had sate with anxious eyes fixed on the lingering day.<br/><br/>And joy was ours to meet: she was most pale,<br/>Famished, and wet and weary, so I cast<br/>My arms around her, lest her steps should fail<br/>As to our home we went, and thus embraced,<br/>Her full heart seemed a deeper joy to taste<br/>Than e'er the prosperous know; the steed behind<br/>Trod peacefully along the mountain waste;<br/>We reached our home ere morning could unbind<br/>Night's latest veil, and on our bridal-couch reclined.<br/><br/>Her chilled heart having cherished in my bosom,<br/>And sweetest kisses past, we two did share<br/>Our peaceful meal:--as an autumnal blossom<br/>Which spreads its shrunk leaves in the sunny air,<br/>After cold showers, like rainbows woven there,<br/>Thus in her lips and cheeks the vital spirit<br/>Mantled, and in her eyes, an atmosphere<br/>Of health, and hope; and sorrow languished near it,<br/>And fear, and all that dark despondence doth inherit.<br/><br/>CANTO 7.<br/><br/>So we sate joyous as the morning ray<br/>Which fed upon the wrecks of night and storm<br/>Now lingering on the winds; light airs did play<br/>Among the dewy weeds, the sun was warm,<br/>And we sate linked in the inwoven charm<br/>Of converse and caresses sweet and deep,<br/>Speechless caresses, talk that might disarm<br/>Time, though he wield the darts of death and sleep,<br/>And those thrice mortal barbs in his own poison steep.<br/><br/>I told her of my sufferings and my madness,<br/>And how, awakened from that dreamy mood<br/>By Liberty's uprise, the strength of gladness<br/>Came to my spirit in my solitude;<br/>And all that now I was--while tears pursued<br/>Each other down her fair and listening cheek<br/>Fast as the thoughts which fed them, like a flood<br/>From sunbright dales; and when I ceased to speak,<br/>Her accents soft and sweet the pausing air did wake.<br/><br/>She told me a strange tale of strange endurance,<br/>Like broken memories of many a heart<br/>Woven into one; to which no firm assurance,<br/>So wild were they, could her own faith impart.<br/>She said that not a tear did dare to start<br/>From the swoln brain, and that her thoughts were firm<br/>When from all mortal hope she did depart,<br/>Borne by those slaves across the Ocean's term,<br/>And that she reached the port without one fear infirm.<br/><br/>One was she among many there, the thralls<br/>Of the cold Tyrant's cruel lust; and they<br/>Laughed mournfully in those polluted halls;<br/>But she was calm and sad, musing alway<br/>On loftiest enterprise, till on a day<br/>The Tyrant heard her singing to her lute<br/>A wild, and sad, and spirit-thrilling lay,<br/>Like winds that die in wastes--one moment mute<br/>The evil thoughts it made, which did his breast pollute.<br/><br/>Even when he saw her wondrous loveliness,<br/>One moment to great Nature's sacred power<br/>He bent, and was no longer passionless;<br/>But when he bade her to his secret bower<br/>Be borne, a loveless victim, and she tore<br/>Her locks in agony, and her words of flame<br/>And mightier looks availed not; then he bore<br/>Again his load of slavery, and became<br/>A king, a heartless beast, a pageant and a name.<br/><br/>She told me what a loathsome agony<br/>Is that when selfishness mocks love's delight,<br/>Foul as in dream's most fearful imagery,<br/>To dally with the mowing dead--that night<br/>All torture, fear, or horror made seem light<br/>Which the soul dreams or knows, and when the day<br/>Shone on her awful frenzy, from the sight<br/>Where like a Spirit in fleshly chains she lay<br/>Struggling, aghast and pale the Tyrant fled away.<br/><br/>Her madness was a beam of light, a power<br/>Which dawned through the rent soul; and words it gave,<br/>Gestures and looks, such as in whirlwinds bore<br/>Which might not be withstood--whence none could save--<br/>All who approached their sphere,--like some calm wave<br/>Vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath;<br/>And sympathy made each attendant slave<br/>Fearless and free, and they began to breathe<br/>Deep curses, like the voice of flames far underneath.<br/><br/>The King felt pale upon his noonday throne:<br/>At night two slaves he to her chamber sent,--<br/>One was a green and wrinkled eunuch, grown<br/>From human shape into an instrument<br/>Of all things ill--distorted, bowed and bent.<br/>The other was a wretch from infancy<br/>Made dumb by poison; who nought knew or meant<br/>But to obey: from the fire isles came he,<br/>A diver lean and strong, of Oman's coral sea.<br/><br/>They bore her to a bark, and the swift stroke<br/>Of silent rowers clove the blue moonlight seas,<br/>Until upon their path the morning broke;<br/>They anchored then, where, be there calm or breeze,<br/>The gloomiest of the drear Symplegades<br/>Shakes with the sleepless surge;--the Ethiop there<br/>Wound his long arms around her, and with knees<br/>Like iron clasped her feet, and plunged with her<br/>Among the closing waves out of the boundless air.<br/><br/>'Swift as an eagle stooping from the plain<br/>Of morning light, into some shadowy wood,<br/>He plunged through the green silence of the main,<br/>Through many a cavern which the eternal flood<br/>Had scooped, as dark lairs for its monster brood;<br/>And among mighty shapes which fled in wonder,<br/>And among mightier shadows which pursued<br/>His heels, he wound: until the dark rocks under<br/>He touched a golden chain--a sound arose like thunder.<br/><br/>'A stunning clang of massive bolts redoubling<br/>Beneath the deep--a burst of waters driven<br/>As from the roots of the sea, raging and bubbling:<br/>And in that roof of crags a space was riven<br/>Through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven,<br/>Shot through the lines of many waves inwoven,<br/>Like sunlight through acacia woods at even,<br/>Through which, his way the diver having cloven,<br/>Passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven.<br/><br/>'And then,' she said, 'he laid me in a cave<br/>Above the waters, by that chasm of sea,<br/>A fountain round and vast, in which the wave<br/>Imprisoned, boiled and leaped perpetually,<br/>Down which, one moment resting, he did flee,<br/>Winning the adverse depth; that spacious cell<br/>Like an hupaithric temple wide and high,<br/>Whose aery dome is inaccessible,<br/>Was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell.<br/><br/>'Below, the fountain's brink was richly paven<br/>With the deep's wealth, coral, and pearl, and sand<br/>Like spangling gold, and purple shells engraven<br/>With mystic legends by no mortal hand,<br/>Left there, when thronging to the moon's command,<br/>The gathering waves rent the Hesperian gate<br/>Of mountains, and on such bright floor did stand<br/>Columns, and shapes like statues, and the state<br/>Of kingless thrones, which Earth did in her heart create.<br/><br/>'The fiend of madness which had made its prey<br/>Of my poor heart, was lulled to sleep awhile:<br/>There was an interval of many a day,<br/>And a sea-eagle brought me food the while,<br/>Whose nest was built in that untrodden isle,<br/>And who, to be the gaoler had been taught<br/>Of that strange dungeon; as a friend whose smile<br/>Like light and rest at morn and even is sought<br/>That wild bird was to me, till madness misery brought.<br/><br/>'The misery of a madness slow and creeping,<br/>Which made the earth seem fire, the sea seem air,<br/>And the white clouds of noon which oft were sleeping,<br/>In the blue heaven so beautiful and fair,<br/>Like hosts of ghastly shadows hovering there;<br/>And the sea-eagle looked a fiend, who bore<br/>Thy mangled limbs for food!--Thus all things were<br/>Transformed into the agony which I wore<br/>Even as a poisoned robe around my bosom's core.<br/><br/>'Again I knew the day and night fast fleeing,<br/>The eagle, and the fountain, and the air;<br/>Another frenzy came--there seemed a being<br/>Within me--a strange load my heart did bear,<br/>As if some living thing had made its lair<br/>Even in the fountains of my life:--a long<br/>And wondrous vision wrought from my despair,<br/>Then grew, like sweet reality among<br/>Dim visionary woes, an unreposing throng.<br/><br/>'Methought I was about to be a mother--<br/>Month after month went by, and still I dreamed<br/>That we should soon be all to one another,<br/>I and my child; and still new pulses seemed<br/>To beat beside my heart, and still I deemed<br/>There was a babe within--and, when the rain<br/>Of winter through the rifted cavern streamed,<br/>Methought, after a lapse of lingering pain,<br/>I saw that lovely shape, which near my heart had lain.<br/><br/>'It was a babe, beautiful from its birth,--<br/>It was like thee, dear love, its eyes were thine,<br/>Its brow, its lips, and so upon the earth<br/>It laid its fingers, as now rest on mine<br/>Thine own, beloved!--'twas a dream divine;<br/>Even to remember how it fled, how swift,<br/>How utterly, might make the heart repine,--<br/>Though 'twas a dream.'--Then Cythna did uplift<br/>Her looks on mine, as if some doubt she sought to shift:<br/><br/>A doubt which would not flee, a tenderness<br/>Of questioning grief, a source of thronging tears;<br/>Which having passed, as one whom sobs oppress<br/>She spoke: 'Yes, in the wilderness of years<br/>Her memory, aye, like a green home appears;<br/>She sucked her fill even at this breast, sweet love,<br/>For many months. I had no mortal fears;<br/>Methought I felt her lips and breath approve,--<br/>It was a human thing which to my bosom clove.<br/><br/>'I watched the dawn of her first smiles; and soon<br/>When zenith stars were trembling on the wave,<br/>Or when the beams of the invisible moon,<br/>Or sun, from many a prism within the cave<br/>Their gem-born shadows to the water gave,<br/>Her looks would hunt them, and with outspread hand,<br/>From the swift lights which might that fountain pave,<br/>She would mark one, and laugh, when that command<br/>Slighting, it lingered there, and could not understand.<br/><br/>'Methought her looks began to talk with me;<br/>And no articulate sounds, but something sweet<br/>Her lips would frame,--so sweet it could not be,<br/>That it was meaningless; her touch would meet<br/>Mine, and our pulses calmly flow and beat<br/>In response while we slept; and on a day<br/>When I was happiest in that strange retreat,<br/>With heaps of golden shells we two did play,--<br/>Both infants, weaving wings for time's perpetual way.<br/><br/>'Ere night, methought, her waning eyes were grown<br/>Weary with joy, and tired with our delight,<br/>We, on the earth, like sister twins lay down<br/>On one fair mother's bosom:--from that night<br/>She fled,--like those illusions clear and bright,<br/>Which dwell in lakes, when the red moon on high<br/>Pause ere it wakens tempest;--and her flight,<br/>Though 'twas the death of brainless fantasy,<br/>Yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery.<br/><br/>'It seemed that in the dreary night the diver<br/>Who brought me thither, came again, and bore<br/>My child away. I saw the waters quiver,<br/>When he so swiftly sunk, as once before:<br/>Then morning came--it shone even as of yore,<br/>But I was changed--the very life was gone<br/>Out of my heart--I wasted more and more,<br/>Day after day, and sitting there alone,<br/>Vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan.<br/><br/>'I was no longer mad, and yet methought<br/>My breasts were swoln and changed:--in every vein<br/>The blood stood still one moment, while that thought<br/>Was passing--with a gush of sickening pain<br/>It ebbed even to its withered springs again:<br/>When my wan eyes in stern resolve I turned<br/>From that most strange delusion, which would fain<br/>Have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned<br/>With more than human love,--then left it unreturned.<br/><br/>'So now my reason was restored to me<br/>I struggled with that dream, which, like a beast<br/>Most fierce and beauteous, in my memory<br/>Had made its lair, and on my heart did feast;<br/>But all that cave and all its shapes, possessed<br/>By thoughts which could not fade, renewed each one<br/>Some smile, some look, some gesture which had blessed<br/>Me heretofore: I, sitting there alone,<br/>Vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan.<br/><br/>'Time passed, I know not whether months or years;<br/>For day, nor night, nor change of seasons made<br/>Its note, but thoughts and unavailing tears:<br/>And I became at last even as a shade,<br/>A smoke, a cloud on which the winds have preyed,<br/>Till it be thin as air; until, one even,<br/>A Nautilus upon the fountain played,<br/>Spreading his azure sail where breath of Heaven<br/>Descended not, among the waves and whirlpools driven.<br/><br/>'And, when the Eagle came, that lovely thing,<br/>Oaring with rosy feet its silver boat,<br/>Fled near me as for shelter; on slow wing,<br/>The Eagle, hovering o'er his prey did float;<br/>But when he saw that I with fear did note<br/>His purpose, proffering my own food to him,<br/>The eager plumes subsided on his throat--<br/>He came where that bright child of sea did swim,<br/>And o'er it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim.<br/><br/>'This wakened me, it gave me human strength;<br/>And hope, I know not whence or wherefore, rose,<br/>But I resumed my ancient powers at length;<br/>My spirit felt again like one of those<br/>Like thine, whose fate it is to make the woes<br/>Of humankind their prey--what was this cave?<br/>Its deep foundation no firm purpose knows<br/>Immutable, resistless, strong to save,<br/>Like mind while yet it mocks the all-devouring grave.<br/><br/>'And where was Laon? might my heart be dead,<br/>While that far dearer heart could move and be?<br/>Or whilst over the earth the pall was spread,<br/>Which I had sworn to rend? I might be free,<br/>Could I but win that friendly bird to me,<br/>To bring me ropes; and long in vain I sought<br/>By intercourse of mutual imagery<br/>Of objects, if such aid he could be taught;<br/>But fruit, and flowers, and boughs, yet never ropes he brought.<br/><br/>'We live in our own world, and mine was made<br/>From glorious fantasies of hope departed:<br/>Aye we are darkened with their floating shade,<br/>Or cast a lustre on them--time imparted<br/>Such power to me--I became fearless-hearted,<br/>My eye and voice grew firm, calm was my mind,<br/>And piercing, like the morn, now it has darted<br/>Its lustre on all hidden things, behind<br/>Yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind.<br/><br/>'My mind became the book through which I grew<br/>Wise in all human wisdom, and its cave,<br/>Which like a mine I rifled through and through,<br/>To me the keeping of its secrets gave--<br/>One mind, the type of all, the moveless wave<br/>Whose calm reflects all moving things that are,<br/>Necessity, and love, and life, the grave,<br/>And sympathy, fountains of hope and fear,<br/>Justice, and truth, and time, and the world's natural sphere.<br/><br/>'And on the sand would I make signs to range<br/>These woofs, as they were woven, of my thought;<br/>Clear, elemental shapes, whose smallest change<br/>A subtler language within language wrought:<br/>The key of truths which once were dimly taught<br/>In old Crotona;--and sweet melodies<br/>Of love, in that lorn solitude I caught<br/>From mine own voice in dream, when thy dear eyes<br/>Shone through my sleep, and did that utterance harmonize.<br/><br/>'Thy songs were winds whereon I fled at will,<br/>As in a winged chariot, o'er the plain<br/>Of crystal youth; and thou wert there to fill<br/>My heart with joy, and there we sate again<br/>On the gray margin of the glimmering main,<br/>Happy as then but wiser far, for we<br/>Smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain<br/>Fear, Faith and Slavery; and mankind was free,<br/>Equal, and pure, and wise, in Wisdom's prophecy.<br/><br/>'For to my will my fancies were as slaves<br/>To do their sweet and subtile ministries;<br/>And oft from that bright fountain's shadowy waves<br/>They would make human throngs gather and rise<br/>To combat with my overflowing eyes,<br/>And voice made deep with passion--thus I grew<br/>Familiar with the shock and the surprise<br/>And war of earthly minds, from which I drew<br/>The power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew.<br/><br/>'And thus my prison was the populous earth--<br/>Where I saw--even as misery dreams of morn<br/>Before the east has given its glory birth--<br/>Religion's pomp made desolate by the scorn<br/>Of Wisdom's faintest smile, and thrones uptorn,<br/>And dwellings of mild people interspersed<br/>With undivided fields of ripening corn,<br/>And love made free,--a hope which we have nursed<br/>Even with our blood and tears,--until its glory burst.<br/><br/>'All is not lost! There is some recompense<br/>For hope whose fountain can be thus profound,<br/>Even throned Evil's splendid impotence,<br/>Girt by its hell of power, the secret sound<br/>Of hymns to truth and freedom--the dread bound<br/>Of life and death passed fearlessly and well,<br/>Dungeons wherein the high resolve is found,<br/>Racks which degraded woman's greatness tell,<br/>And what may else be good and irresistible.<br/><br/>'Such are the thoughts which, like the fires that flare<br/>In storm-encompassed isles, we cherish yet<br/>In this dark ruin--such were mine even there;<br/>As in its sleep some odorous violet,<br/>While yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet,<br/>Breathes in prophetic dreams of day's uprise,<br/>Or as, ere Scythian frost in fear has met<br/>Spring's messengers descending from the skies,<br/>The buds foreknow their life--this hope must ever rise.<br/><br/>'So years had passed, when sudden earthquake rent<br/>The depth of ocean, and the cavern cracked<br/>With sound, as if the world's wide continent<br/>Had fallen in universal ruin wracked:<br/>And through the cleft streamed in one cataract<br/>The stifling waters--when I woke, the flood<br/>Whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked<br/>Was ebbing round me, and my bright abode<br/>Before me yawned--a chasm desert, and bare, and broad.<br/><br/>'Above me was the sky, beneath the sea:<br/>I stood upon a point of shattered stone,<br/>And heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously<br/>With splash and shock into the deep--anon<br/>All ceased, and there was silence wide and lone.<br/>I felt that I was free! The Ocean-spray<br/>Quivered beneath my feet, the broad Heaven shone<br/>Around, and in my hair the winds did play<br/>Lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way.<br/><br/>'My spirit moved upon the sea like wind<br/>Which round some thymy cape will lag and hover,<br/>Though it can wake the still cloud, and unbind<br/>The strength of tempest: day was almost over,<br/>When through the fading light I could discover<br/>A ship approaching--its white sails were fed<br/>With the north wind--its moving shade did cover<br/>The twilight deep; the mariners in dread<br/>Cast anchor when they saw new rocks around them spread.<br/><br/>'And when they saw one sitting on a crag,<br/>They sent a boat to me;--the Sailors rowed<br/>In awe through many a new and fearful jag<br/>Of overhanging rock, through which there flowed<br/>The foam of streams that cannot make abode.<br/>They came and questioned me, but when they heard<br/>My voice, they became silent, and they stood<br/>And moved as men in whom new love had stirred<br/>Deep thoughts: so to the ship we passed without a word.<br/><br/>CANTO 8.<br/><br/>'I sate beside the Steersman then, and gazing<br/>Upon the west, cried, "Spread the sails! Behold!<br/>The sinking moon is like a watch-tower blazing<br/>Over the mountains yet;--the City of Gold<br/>Yon Cape alone does from the sight withhold;<br/>The stream is fleet--the north breathes steadily<br/>Beneath the stars; they tremble with the cold!<br/>Ye cannot rest upon the dreary sea!--<br/>Haste, haste to the warm home of happier destiny!"<br/><br/>'The Mariners obeyed--the Captain stood<br/>Aloof, and, whispering to the Pilot, said,<br/>"Alas, alas! I fear we are pursued<br/>By wicked ghosts; a Phantom of the Dead,<br/>The night before we sailed, came to my bed<br/>In dream, like that!" The Pilot then replied,<br/>"It cannot be--she is a human Maid--<br/>Her low voice makes you weep--she is some bride,<br/>Or daughter of high birth--she can be nought beside."<br/><br/>'We passed the islets, borne by wind and stream,<br/>And as we sailed, the Mariners came near<br/>And thronged around to listen;--in the gleam<br/>Of the pale moon I stood, as one whom fear<br/>May not attaint, and my calm voice did rear;<br/>"Ye are all human--yon broad moon gives light<br/>To millions who the selfsame likeness wear,<br/>Even while I speak--beneath this very night,<br/>Their thoughts flow on like ours, in sadness or delight.<br/><br/>'"What dream ye? Your own hands have built an home,<br/>Even for yourselves on a beloved shore:<br/>For some, fond eyes are pining till they come,<br/>How they will greet him when his toils are o'er,<br/>And laughing babes rush from the well-known door!<br/>Is this your care? ye toil for your own good--<br/>Ye feel and think--has some immortal power<br/>Such purposes? or in a human mood,<br/>Dream ye some Power thus builds for man in solitude?<br/><br/>'"What is that Power? Ye mock yourselves, and give<br/>A human heart to what ye cannot know:<br/>As if the cause of life could think and live!<br/>'Twere as if man's own works should feel, and show<br/>The hopes, and fears, and thoughts from which they flow,<br/>And he be like to them!

and makes she bare<br/>Her breast, that all in peace its drainless stores may share?<br/><br/>I have heard friendly sounds from many a tongue<br/>Which was not human--the lone nightingale<br/>Has answered me with her most soothing song,<br/>Out of her ivy bower, when I sate pale<br/>With grief, and sighed beneath; from many a dale<br/>The antelopes who flocked for food have spoken<br/>With happy sounds, and motions, that avail<br/>Like man's own speech; and such was now the token<br/>Of waning night, whose calm by that proud neigh was broken.<br/><br/>Each night, that mighty steed bore me abroad,<br/>And I returned with food to our retreat,<br/>And dark intelligence; the blood which flowed<br/>Over the fields, had stained the courser's feet;<br/>Soon the dust drinks that bitter dew,--then meet<br/>The vulture, and the wild dog, and the snake,<br/>The wolf, and the hyaena gray, and eat<br/>The dead in horrid truce: their throngs did make<br/>Behind the steed, a chasm like waves in a ship's wake.<br/><br/>For, from the utmost realms of earth came pouring<br/>The banded slaves whom every despot sent<br/>At that throned traitor's summons; like the roaring<br/>Of fire, whose floods the wild deer circumvent<br/>In the scorched pastures of the South; so bent<br/>The armies of the leagued Kings around<br/>Their files of steel and flame;--the continent<br/>Trembled, as with a zone of ruin bound,<br/>Beneath their feet, the sea shook with their Navies' sound.<br/><br/>From every nation of the earth they came,<br/>The multitude of moving heartless things,<br/>Whom slaves call men: obediently they came,<br/>Like sheep whom from the fold the shepherd brings<br/>To the stall, red with blood; their many kings<br/>Led them, thus erring, from their native land;<br/>Tartar and Frank, and millions whom the wings<br/>Of Indian breezes lull, and many a band<br/>The Arctic Anarch sent, and Idumea's sand,<br/><br/>Fertile in prodigies and lies;--so there<br/>Strange natures made a brotherhood of ill.<br/>The desert savage ceased to grasp in fear<br/>His Asian shield and bow, when, at the will<br/>Of Europe's subtler son, the bolt would kill<br/>Some shepherd sitting on a rock secure;<br/>But smiles of wondering joy his face would fill,<br/>And savage sympathy: those slaves impure,<br/>Each one the other thus from ill to ill did lure.<br/><br/>For traitorously did that foul Tyrant robe<br/>His countenance in lies,--even at the hour<br/>When he was snatched from death, then o'er the globe,<br/>With secret signs from many a mountain-tower,<br/>With smoke by day, and fire by night, the power<br/>Of Kings and Priests, those dark conspirators,<br/>He called:--they knew his cause their own, and swore<br/>Like wolves and serpents to their mutual wars<br/>Strange truce, with many a rite which Earth and Heaven abhors.<br/><br/>Myriads had come--millions were on their way;<br/>The Tyrant passed, surrounded by the steel<br/>Of hired assassins, through the public way,<br/>Choked with his country's dead:--his footsteps reel<br/>On the fresh blood--he smiles. 'Ay, now I feel<br/>I am a King in truth!' he said, and took<br/>His royal seat, and bade the torturing wheel<br/>Be brought, and fire, and pincers, and the hook,<br/>And scorpions, that his soul on its revenge might look.<br/><br/>'But first, go slay the rebels--why return<br/>The victor bands?' he said, 'millions yet live,<br/>Of whom the weakest with one word might turn<br/>The scales of victory yet;--let none survive<br/>But those within the walls--each fifth shall give<br/>The expiation for his brethren here.--<br/>Go forth, and waste and kill!'--'O king, forgive<br/>My speech,' a soldier answered--'but we fear<br/>The spirits of the night, and morn is drawing near;<br/><br/>'For we were slaying still without remorse,<br/>And now that dreadful chief beneath my hand<br/>Defenceless lay, when on a hell-black horse,<br/>An Angel bright as day, waving a brand<br/>Which flashed among the stars, passed.'--'Dost thou stand<br/>Parleying with me, thou wretch?' the king replied;<br/>'Slaves, bind him to the wheel; and of this band,<br/>Whoso will drag that woman to his side<br/>That scared him thus, may burn his dearest foe beside;<br/><br/>'And gold and glory shall be his.--Go forth!'<br/>They rushed into the plain.--Loud was the roar<br/>Of their career: the horsemen shook the earth;<br/>The wheeled artillery's speed the pavement tore;<br/>The infantry, file after file, did pour<br/>Their clouds on the utmost hills. Five days they slew<br/>Among the wasted fields; the sixth saw gore<br/>Stream through the city; on the seventh, the dew<br/>Of slaughter became stiff, and there was peace anew:<br/><br/>Peace in the desert fields and villages,<br/>Between the glutted beasts and mangled dead!<br/>Peace in the silent streets! save when the cries<br/>Of victims to their fiery judgement led,<br/>Made pale their voiceless lips who seemed to dread<br/>Even in their dearest kindred, lest some tongue<br/>Be faithless to the fear yet unbetrayed;<br/>Peace in the Tyrant's palace, where the throng<br/>Waste the triumphal hours in festival and song!<br/><br/>Day after day the burning sun rolled on<br/>Over the death-polluted land--it came<br/>Out of the east like fire, and fiercely shone<br/>A lamp of Autumn, ripening with its flame<br/>The few lone ears of corn;--the sky became<br/>Stagnate with heat, so that each cloud and blast<br/>Languished and died,--the thirsting air did claim<br/>All moisture, and a rotting vapour passed<br/>From the unburied dead, invisible and fast.<br/><br/>First Want, then Plague came on the beasts; their food<br/>Failed, and they drew the breath of its decay.<br/>Millions on millions, whom the scent of blood<br/>Had lured, or who, from regions far away,<br/>Had tracked the hosts in festival array,<br/>From their dark deserts; gaunt and wasting now,<br/>Stalked like fell shades among their perished prey;<br/>In their green eyes a strange disease did glow,<br/>They sank in hideous spasm, or pains severe and slow.<br/><br/>The fish were poisoned in the streams; the birds<br/>In the green woods perished; the insect race<br/>Was withered up; the scattered flocks and herds<br/>Who had survived the wild beasts' hungry chase<br/>Died moaning, each upon the other's face<br/>In helpless agony gazing; round the City<br/>All night, the lean hyaenas their sad case<br/>Like starving infants wailed; a woeful ditty!<br/>And many a mother wept, pierced with unnatural pity.<br/><br/>Amid the aereal minarets on high,<br/>The Ethiopian vultures fluttering fell<br/>From their long line of brethren in the sky,<br/>Startling the concourse of mankind.--Too well<br/>These signs the coming mischief did foretell:--<br/>Strange panic first, a deep and sickening dread<br/>Within each heart, like ice, did sink and dwell,<br/>A voiceless thought of evil, which did spread<br/>With the quick glance of eyes, like withering lightnings shed.<br/><br/>Day after day, when the year wanes, the frosts<br/>Strip its green crown of leaves, till all is bare;<br/>So on those strange and congregated hosts<br/>Came Famine, a swift shadow, and the air<br/>Groaned with the burden of a new despair;<br/>Famine, than whom Misrule no deadlier daughter<br/>Feeds from her thousand breasts, though sleeping there<br/>With lidless eyes, lie Faith, and Plague, and Slaughter,<br/>A ghastly brood; conceived of Lethe's sullen water.<br/><br/>There was no food, the corn was trampled down,<br/>The flocks and herds had perished; on the shore<br/>The dead and putrid fish were ever thrown;<br/>The deeps were foodless, and the winds no more<br/>Creaked with the weight of birds, but, as before<br/>Those winged things sprang forth, were void of shade;<br/>The vines and orchards, Autumn's golden store,<br/>Were burned;--so that the meanest food was weighed<br/>With gold, and Avarice died before the god it made.<br/><br/>There was no corn--in the wide market-place<br/>All loathliest things, even human flesh, was sold;<br/>They weighed it in small scales--and many a face<br/>Was fixed in eager horror then: his gold<br/>The miser brought; the tender maid, grown bold<br/>Through hunger, bared her scorned charms in vain;<br/>The mother brought her eldest born, controlled<br/>By instinct blind as love, but turned again<br/>And bade her infant suck, and died in silent pain.<br/><br/>Then fell blue Plague upon the race of man.<br/>'O, for the sheathed steel, so late which gave<br/>Oblivion to the dead, when the streets ran<br/>With brothers' blood! O, that the earthquake's grave<br/>Would gape, or Ocean lift its stifling wave!'<br/>Vain cries--throughout the streets thousands pursued<br/>Each by his fiery torture howl and rave,<br/>Or sit in frenzy's unimagined mood,<br/>Upon fresh heaps of dead; a ghastly multitude.<br/><br/>It was not hunger now, but thirst. Each well<br/>Was choked with rotting corpses, and became<br/>A cauldron of green mist made visible<br/>At sunrise. Thither still the myriads came,<br/>Seeking to quench the agony of the flame,<br/>Which raged like poison through their bursting veins;<br/>Naked they were from torture, without shame,<br/>Spotted with nameless scars and lurid blains,<br/>Childhood, and youth, and age, writhing in savage pains.<br/><br/>It was not thirst, but madness! Many saw<br/>Their own lean image everywhere, it went<br/>A ghastlier self beside them, till the awe<br/>Of that dread sight to self-destruction sent<br/>Those shrieking victims; some, ere life was spent,<br/>Sought, with a horrid sympathy, to shed<br/>Contagion on the sound; and others rent<br/>Their matted hair, and cried aloud, 'We tread<br/>On fire! the avenging Power his hell on earth has spread!'<br/><br/>Sometimes the living by the dead were hid.<br/>Near the great fountain in the public square,<br/>Where corpses made a crumbling pyramid<br/>Under the sun, was heard one stifled prayer<br/>For life, in the hot silence of the air;<br/>And strange 'twas, amid that hideous heap to see<br/>Some shrouded in their long and golden hair,<br/>As if not dead, but slumbering quietly<br/>Like forms which sculptors carve, then love to agony.<br/><br/>Famine had spared the palace of the king:--<br/>He rioted in festival the while,<br/>He and his guards and priests; but Plague did fling<br/>One shadow upon all. Famine can smile<br/>On him who brings it food, and pass, with guile<br/>Of thankful falsehood, like a courtier gray,<br/>The house-dog of the throne; but many a mile<br/>Comes Plague, a winged wolf, who loathes alway<br/>The garbage and the scum that strangers make her prey.<br/><br/>So, near the throne, amid the gorgeous feast,<br/>Sheathed in resplendent arms, or loosely dight<br/>To luxury, ere the mockery yet had ceased<br/>That lingered on his lips, the warrior's might<br/>Was loosened, and a new and ghastlier night<br/>In dreams of frenzy lapped his eyes; he fell<br/>Headlong, or with stiff eyeballs sate upright<br/>Among the guests, or raving mad did tell<br/>Strange truths; a dying seer of dark oppression's hell.<br/><br/>The Princes and the Priests were pale with terror;<br/>That monstrous faith wherewith they ruled mankind,<br/>Fell, like a shaft loosed by the bowman's error,<br/>On their own hearts: they sought and they could find<br/>No refuge--'twas the blind who led the blind!<br/>So, through the desolate streets to the high fane,<br/>The many-tongued and endless armies wind<br/>In sad procession: each among the train<br/>To his own Idol lifts his supplications vain.<br/><br/>'O God!' they cried, 'we know our secret pride<br/>Has scorned thee, and thy worship, and thy name;<br/>Secure in human power we have defied<br/>Thy fearful might; we bend in fear and shame<br/>Before thy presence; with the dust we claim<br/>Kindred; be merciful, O King of Heaven!<br/>Most justly have we suffered for thy fame<br/>Made dim, but be at length our sins forgiven,<br/>Ere to despair and death thy worshippers be driven.<br/><br/>'O King of Glory! thou alone hast power!<br/>Who can resist thy will? who can restrain<br/>Thy wrath, when on the guilty thou dost shower<br/>The shafts of thy revenge, a blistering rain?<br/>Greatest and best, be merciful again!<br/>Have we not stabbed thine enemies, and made<br/>The Earth an altar, and the Heavens a fane,<br/>Where thou wert worshipped with their blood, and laid<br/>Those hearts in dust which would thy searchless works have weighed?<br/><br/>'Well didst thou loosen on this impious City<br/>Thine angels of revenge: recall them now;<br/>Thy worshippers, abased, here kneel for pity,<br/>And bind their souls by an immortal vow:<br/>We swear by thee! and to our oath do thou<br/>Give sanction, from thine hell of fiends and flame,<br/>That we will kill with fire and torments slow,<br/>The last of those who mocked thy holy name,<br/>And scorned the sacred laws thy prophets did proclaim.'<br/><br/>Thus they with trembling limbs and pallid lips<br/>Worshipped their own hearts' image, dim and vast,<br/>Scared by the shade wherewith they would eclipse<br/>The light of other minds;--troubled they passed<br/>From the great Temple;--fiercely still and fast<br/>The arrows of the plague among them fell,<br/>And they on one another gazed aghast,<br/>And through the hosts contention wild befell,<br/>As each of his own god the wondrous works did tell.<br/><br/>And Oromaze, Joshua, and Mahomet,<br/>Moses, and Buddh, Zerdusht, and Brahm, and Foh,<br/>A tumult of strange names, which never met<br/>Before, as watchwords of a single woe,<br/>Arose; each raging votary 'gan to throw<br/>Aloft his armed hands, and each did howl<br/>'Our God alone is God!'--and slaughter now<br/>Would have gone forth, when from beneath a cowl<br/>A voice came forth, which pierced like ice through every soul.<br/><br/>'Twas an Iberian Priest from whom it came,<br/>A zealous man, who led the legioned West,<br/>With words which faith and pride had steeped in flame,<br/>To quell the unbelievers; a dire guest<br/>Even to his friends was he, for in his breast<br/>Did hate and guile lie watchful, intertwined,<br/>Twin serpents in one deep and winding nest;<br/>He loathed all faith beside his own, and pined<br/>To wreak his fear of Heaven in vengeance on mankind.<br/><br/>But more he loathed and hated the clear light<br/>Of wisdom and free thought, and more did fear,<br/>Lest, kindled once, its beams might pierce the night,<br/>Even where his Idol stood; for, far and near<br/>Did many a heart in Europe leap to hear<br/>That faith and tyranny were trampled down;<br/>Many a pale victim, doomed for truth to share<br/>The murderer's cell, or see, with helpless groan,<br/>The priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own.<br/><br/>He dared not kill the infidels with fire<br/>Or steel, in Europe; the slow agonies<br/>Of legal torture mocked his keen desire:<br/>So he made truce with those who did despise<br/>The expiation, and the sacrifice,<br/>That, though detested, Islam's kindred creed<br/>Might crush for him those deadlier enemies;<br/>For fear of God did in his bosom breed<br/>A jealous hate of man, an unreposing need.<br/><br/>'Peace! Peace!' he cried, 'when we are dead, the Day<br/>Of Judgement comes, and all shall surely know<br/>Whose God is God, each fearfully shall pay<br/>The errors of his faith in endless woe!<br/>But there is sent a mortal vengeance now<br/>On earth, because an impious race had spurned<br/>Him whom we all adore,--a subtle foe,<br/>By whom for ye this dread reward was earned,<br/>And kingly thrones, which rest on faith, nigh overturned.<br/><br/>'Think ye, because ye weep, and kneel, and pray,<br/>That God will lull the pestilence? It rose<br/>Even from beneath his throne, where, many a day,<br/>His mercy soothed it to a dark repose:<br/>It walks upon the earth to judge his foes;<br/>And what are thou and I, that he should deign<br/>To curb his ghastly minister, or close<br/>The gates of death, ere they receive the twain<br/>Who shook with mortal spells his undefended reign?<br/><br/>'Ay, there is famine in the gulf of hell,<br/>Its giant worms of fire for ever yawn.--<br/>Their lurid eyes are on us! those who fell<br/>By the swift shafts of pestilence ere dawn,<br/>Are in their jaws! they hunger for the spawn<br/>Of Satan, their own brethren, who were sent<br/>To make our souls their spoil. See! see! they fawn<br/>Like dogs, and they will sleep with luxury spent,<br/>When those detested hearts their iron fangs have rent!<br/><br/>'Our God may then lull Pestilence to sleep:--<br/>Pile high the pyre of expiation now,<br/>A forest's spoil of boughs, and on the heap<br/>Pour venomous gums, which sullenly and slow,<br/>When touched by flame, shall burn, and melt, and flow,<br/>A stream of clinging fire,--and fix on high<br/>A net of iron, and spread forth below<br/>A couch of snakes, and scorpions, and the fry<br/>Of centipedes and worms, earth's hellish progeny!<br/><br/>'Let Laon and Laone on that pyre,<br/>Linked tight with burning brass, perish!--then pray<br/>That, with this sacrifice, the withering ire<br/>Of Heaven may be appeased.' He ceased, and they<br/>A space stood silent, as far, far away<br/>The echoes of his voice among them died;<br/>And he knelt down upon the dust, alway<br/>Muttering the curses of his speechless pride,<br/>Whilst shame, and fear, and awe, the armies did divide.<br/><br/>His voice was like a blast that burst the portal<br/>Of fabled hell; and as he spake, each one<br/>Saw gape beneath the chasms of fire immortal,<br/>And Heaven above seemed cloven, where, on a throne<br/>Girt round with storms and shadows, sate alone<br/>Their King and Judge--fear killed in every breast<br/>All natural pity then, a fear unknown<br/>Before, and with an inward fire possessed,<br/>They raged like homeless beasts whom burning woods invest.<br/><br/>'Twas morn.--At noon the public crier went forth,<br/>Proclaiming through the living and the dead,<br/>'The Monarch saith, that his great Empire's worth<br/>Is set on Laon and Laone's head:<br/>He who but one yet living here can lead,<br/>Or who the life from both their hearts can wring,<br/>Shall be the kingdom's heir--a glorious meed!<br/>But he who both alive can hither bring,<br/>The Princess shall espouse, and reign an equal King.'<br/><br/>Ere night the pyre was piled, the net of iron<br/>Was spread above, the fearful couch below;<br/>It overtopped the towers that did environ<br/>That spacious square; for Fear is never slow<br/>To build the thrones of Hate, her mate and foe;<br/>So, she scourged forth the maniac multitude<br/>To rear this pyramid--tottering and slow,<br/>Plague-stricken, foodless, like lean herds pursued<br/>By gadflies, they have piled the heath, and gums, and wood.<br/><br/>Night came, a starless and a moonless gloom.<br/>Until the dawn, those hosts of many a nation<br/>Stood round that pile, as near one lover's tomb<br/>Two gentle sisters mourn their desolation;<br/>And in the silence of that expectation,<br/>Was heard on high the reptiles' hiss and crawl--<br/>It was so deep--save when the devastation<br/>Of the swift pest, with fearful interval,<br/>Marking its path with shrieks, among the crowd would fall.<br/><br/>Morn came,--among those sleepless multitudes,<br/>Madness, and Fear, and Plague, and Famine still<br/>Heaped corpse on corpse, as in autumnal woods<br/>The frosts of many a wind with dead leaves fill<br/>Earth's cold and sullen brooks; in silence, still<br/>The pale survivors stood; ere noon, the fear<br/>Of Hell became a panic, which did kill<br/>Like hunger or disease, with whispers drear,<br/>As 'Hush! hark! Come they yet?--Just Heaven! thine hour is near!'<br/><br/>And Priests rushed through their ranks, some counterfeiting<br/>The rage they did inspire, some mad indeed<br/>With their own lies; they said their god was waiting<br/>To see his enemies writhe, and burn, and bleed,--<br/>And that, till then, the snakes of Hell had need<br/>Of human souls:--three hundred furnaces<br/>Soon blazed through the wide City, where, with speed,<br/>Men brought their infidel kindred to appease<br/>God's wrath, and, while they burned, knelt round on quivering knees.<br/><br/>The noontide sun was darkened with that smoke,<br/>The winds of eve dispersed those ashes gray.<br/>The madness which these rites had lulled, awoke<br/>Again at sunset.--Who shall dare to say<br/>The deeds which night and fear brought forth, or weigh<br/>In balance just the good and evil there?<br/>He might man's deep and searchless heart display,<br/>And cast a light on those dim labyrinths, where<br/>Hope, near imagined chasms, is struggling with despair.<br/><br/>'Tis said, a mother dragged three children then,<br/>To those fierce flames which roast the eyes in the head,<br/>And laughed, and died; and that unholy men,<br/>Feasting like fiends upon the infidel dead,<br/>Looked from their meal, and saw an Angel tread<br/>The visible floor of Heaven, and it was she!<br/>And, on that night, one without doubt or dread<br/>Came to the fire, and said, 'Stop, I am he!<br/>Kill me!'--They burned them both with hellish mockery.<br/><br/>And, one by one, that night, young maidens came,<br/>Beauteous and calm, like shapes of living stone<br/>Clothed in the light of dreams, and by the flame<br/>Which shrank as overgorged, they laid them down,<br/>And sung a low sweet song, of which alone<br/>One word was heard, and that was Liberty;<br/>And that some kissed their marble feet, with moan<br/>Like love, and died; and then that they did die<br/>With happy smiles, which sunk in white tranquillity.<br/><br/>CANTO 11.<br/><br/>She saw me not--she heard me not--alone<br/>Upon the mountain's dizzy brink she stood;<br/>She spake not, breathed not, moved not--there was thrown<br/>Over her look, the shadow of a mood<br/>Which only clothes the heart in solitude,<br/>A thought of voiceless depth;--she stood alone,<br/>Above, the Heavens were spread;--below, the flood<br/>Was murmuring in its caves;--the wind had blown<br/>Her hair apart, through which her eyes and forehead shone.<br/><br/>A cloud was hanging o'er the western mountains;<br/>Before its blue and moveless depth were flying<br/>Gray mists poured forth from the unresting fountains<br/>Of darkness in the North:--the day was dying:--<br/>Sudden, the sun shone forth, its beams were lying<br/>Like boiling gold on Ocean, strange to see,<br/>And on the shattered vapours, which defying<br/>The power of light in vain, tossed restlessly<br/>In the red Heaven, like wrecks in a tempestuous sea.<br/><br/>It was a stream of living beams, whose bank<br/>On either side by the cloud's cleft was made;<br/>And where its chasms that flood of glory drank,<br/>Its waves gushed forth like fire, and as if swayed<br/>By some mute tempest, rolled on HER; the shade<br/>Of her bright image floated on the river<br/>Of liquid light, which then did end and fade--<br/>Her radiant shape upon its verge did shiver;<br/>Aloft, her flowing hair like strings of flame did quiver.<br/><br/>I stood beside her, but she saw me not--<br/>She looked upon the sea, and skies, and earth;<br/>Rapture, and love, and admiration wrought<br/>A passion deeper far than tears, or mirth,<br/>Or speech, or gesture, or whate'er has birth<br/>From common joy; which with the speechless feeling<br/>That led her there united, and shot forth<br/>From her far eyes a light of deep revealing,<br/>All but her dearest self from my regard concealing.<br/><br/>Her lips were parted, and the measured breath<br/>Was now heard there;--her dark and intricate eyes<br/>Orb within orb, deeper than sleep or death,<br/>Absorbed the glories of the burning skies,<br/>Which, mingling with her heart's deep ecstasies,<br/>Burst from her looks and gestures;--and a light<br/>Of liquid tenderness, like love, did rise<br/>From her whole frame, an atmosphere which quite<br/>Arrayed her in its beams, tremulous and soft and bright.<br/><br/>She would have clasped me to her glowing frame;<br/>Those warm and odorous lips might soon have shed<br/>On mine the fragrance and the invisible flame<br/>Which now the cold winds stole;--she would have laid<br/>Upon my languid heart her dearest head;<br/>I might have heard her voice, tender and sweet;<br/>Her eyes, mingling with mine, might soon have fed<br/>My soul with their own joy.--One moment yet<br/>I gazed--we parted then, never again to meet!<br/><br/>Never but once to meet on Earth again!<br/>She heard me as I fled--her eager tone<br/>Sunk on my heart, and almost wove a chain<br/>Around my will to link it with her own,<br/>So that my stern resolve was almost gone.<br/>'I cannot reach thee! whither dost thou fly?<br/>My steps are faint--Come back, thou dearest one--<br/>Return, ah me! return!'--The wind passed by<br/>On which those accents died, faint, far, and lingeringly.<br/><br/>Woe! Woe! that moonless midnight!--Want and Pest<br/>Were horrible, but one more fell doth rear,<br/>As in a hydra's swarming lair, its crest<br/>Eminent among those victims--even the Fear<br/>Of Hell: each girt by the hot atmosphere<br/>Of his blind agony, like a scorpion stung<br/>By his own rage upon his burning bier<br/>Of circling coals of fire; but still there clung<br/>One hope, like a keen sword on starting threads uphung:<br/><br/>Not death--death was no more refuge or rest;<br/>Not life--it was despair to be!--not sleep,<br/>For fiends and chasms of fire had dispossessed<br/>All natural dreams: to wake was not to weep,<br/>But to gaze mad and pallid, at the leap<br/>To which the Future, like a snaky scourge,<br/>Or like some tyrant's eye, which aye doth keep<br/>Its withering beam upon his slaves, did urge<br/>Their steps; they heard the roar of Hell's sulphureous surge.<br/><br/>Each of that multitude, alone, and lost<br/>To sense of outward things, one hope yet knew;<br/>As on a foam-girt crag some seaman tossed<br/>Stares at the rising tide, or like the crew<br/>Whilst now the ship is splitting through and through;<br/>Each, if the tramp of a far steed was heard,<br/>Started from sick despair, or if there flew<br/>One murmur on the wind, or if some word<br/>Which none can gather yet, the distant crowd has stirred.<br/><br/>Why became cheeks, wan with the kiss of death,<br/>Paler from hope? they had sustained despair.<br/>Why watched those myriads with suspended breath<br/>Sleepless a second night? they are not here,<br/>The victims, and hour by hour, a vision drear,<br/>Warm corpses fall upon the clay-cold dead;<br/>And even in death their lips are wreathed with fear.--<br/>The crowd is mute and moveless--overhead<br/>Silent Arcturus shines--'Ha! hear'st thou not the tread<br/><br/>'Of rushing feet? laughter? the shout, the scream,<br/>Of triumph not to be contained? See! hark!<br/>They come, they come! give way!' Alas, ye deem<br/>Falsely--'tis but a crowd of maniacs stark<br/>Driven, like a troop of spectres, through the dark,<br/>From the choked well, whence a bright death-fire sprung,<br/>A lurid earth-star, which dropped many a spark<br/>From its blue train, and spreading widely, clung<br/>To their wild hair, like mist the topmost pines among.<br/><br/>And many, from the crowd collected there,<br/>Joined that strange dance in fearful sympathies;<br/>There was the silence of a long despair,<br/>When the last echo of those terrible cries<br/>Came from a distant street, like agonies<br/>Stifled afar.--Before the Tyrant's throne<br/>All night his aged Senate sate, their eyes<br/>In stony expectation fixed; when one<br/>Sudden before them stood, a Stranger and alone.<br/><br/>Dark Priests and haughty Warriors gazed on him<br/>With baffled wonder, for a hermit's vest<br/>Concealed his face; but when he spake, his tone,<br/>Ere yet the matter did their thoughts arrest,--<br/>Earnest, benignant, calm, as from a breast<br/>Void of all hate or terror--made them start;<br/>For as with gentle accents he addressed<br/>His speech to them, on each unwilling heart<br/>Unusual awe did fall--a spirit-quelling dart.<br/><br/>'Ye Princes of the Earth, ye sit aghast<br/>Amid the ruin which yourselves have made,<br/>Yes, Desolation heard your trumpet's blast,<br/>And sprang from sleep!--dark Terror has obeyed<br/>Your bidding--O, that I whom ye have made<br/>Your foe, could set my dearest enemy free<br/>From pain and fear! but evil casts a shade,<br/>Which cannot pass so soon, and Hate must be<br/>The nurse and parent still of an ill progeny.<br/><br/>'Ye turn to Heaven for aid in your distress;<br/>Alas, that ye, the mighty and the wise,<br/>Who, if ye dared, might not aspire to less<br/>Than ye conceive of power, should fear the lies<br/>Which thou, and thou, didst frame for mysteries<br/>To blind your slaves:--consider your own thought,<br/>An empty and a cruel sacrifice<br/>Ye now prepare, for a vain idol wrought<br/>Out of the fears and hate which vain desires have brought.<br/><br/>'Ye seek for happiness--alas, the day!<br/>Ye find it not in luxury nor in gold,<br/>Nor in the fame, nor in the envied sway<br/>For which, O willing slaves to Custom old,<br/>Severe taskmistress! ye your hearts have sold.<br/>Ye seek for peace, and when ye die, to dream<br/>No evil dreams: all mortal things are cold<br/>And senseless then; if aught survive, I deem<br/>It must be love and joy, for they immortal seem.<br/><br/>'Fear not the future, weep not for the past.<br/>Oh, could I win your ears to dare be now<br/>Glorious, and great, and calm! that ye would cast<br/>Into the dust those symbols of your woe,<br/>Purple, and gold, and steel! that ye would go<br/>Proclaiming to the nations whence ye came,<br/>That Want, and Plague, and Fear, from slavery flow;<br/>And that mankind is free, and that the shame<br/>Of royalty and faith is lost in freedom's fame!<br/><br/>'If thus, 'tis well--if not, I come to say<br/>That Laon--' while the Stranger spoke, among<br/>The Council sudden tumult and affray<br/>Arose, for many of those warriors young,<br/>Had on his eloquent accents fed and hung<br/>Like bees on mountain-flowers; they knew the truth,<br/>And from their thrones in vindication sprung;<br/>The men of faith and law then without ruth<br/>Drew forth their secret steel, and stabbed each ardent youth.<br/><br/>They stabbed them in the back and sneered--a slave<br/>Who stood behind the throne, those corpses drew<br/>Each to its bloody, dark, and secret grave;<br/>And one more daring raised his steel anew<br/>To pierce the Stranger. 'What hast thou to do<br/>With me, poor wretch?'--Calm, solemn and severe,<br/>That voice unstrung his sinews, and he threw<br/>His dagger on the ground, and pale with fear,<br/>Sate silently--his voice then did the Stranger rear.<br/><br/>'It doth avail not that I weep for ye--<br/>Ye cannot change, since ye are old and gray,<br/>And ye have chosen your lot--your fame must be<br/>A book of blood, whence in a milder day<br/>Men shall learn truth, when ye are wrapped in clay:<br/>Now ye shall triumph. I am Laon's friend,<br/>And him to your revenge will I betray,<br/>So ye concede one easy boon. Attend!<br/>For now I speak of things which ye can apprehend.<br/><br/>'There is a People mighty in its youth,<br/>A land beyond the Oceans of the West,<br/>Where, though with rudest rites, Freedom and Truth<br/>Are worshipped; from a glorious Mother's breast,<br/>Who, since high Athens fell, among the rest<br/>Sate like the Queen of Nations, but in woe,<br/>By inbred monsters outraged and oppressed,<br/>Turns to her chainless child for succour now,<br/>It draws the milk of Power in Wisdom's fullest flow.<br/><br/>'That land is like an Eagle, whose young gaze<br/>Feeds on the noontide beam, whose golden plume<br/>Floats moveless on the storm, and in the blaze<br/>Of sunrise gleams when Earth is wrapped in gloom;<br/>An epitaph of glory for the tomb<br/>Of murdered Europe may thy fame be made,<br/>Great People! as the sands shalt thou become;<br/>Thy growth is swift as morn, when night must fade;<br/>The multitudinous Earth shall sleep beneath thy shade.<br/><br/>'Yes, in the desert there is built a home<br/>For Freedom. Genius is made strong to rear<br/>The monuments of man beneath the dome<br/>Of a new Heaven; myriads assemble there,<br/>Whom the proud lords of man, in rage or fear,<br/>Drive from their wasted homes: the boon I pray<br/>Is this--that Cythna shall be convoyed there--<br/>Nay, start not at the name--America!<br/>And then to you this night Laon will I betray.<br/><br/>'With me do what ye will. I am your foe!'<br/>The light of such a joy as makes the stare<br/>Of hungry snakes like living emeralds glow,<br/>Shone in a hundred human eyes--'Where, where<br/>Is Laon? Haste! fly! drag him swiftly here!<br/>We grant thy boon.'--'I put no trust in ye,<br/>Swear by the Power ye dread.'--'We swear, we swear!'<br/>The Stranger threw his vest back suddenly,<br/>And smiled in gentle pride, and said, 'Lo! I am he!'<br/><br/>CANTO 12.<br/><br/>The transport of a fierce and monstrous gladness<br/>Spread through the multitudinous streets, fast flying<br/>Upon the winds of fear; from his dull madness<br/>The starveling waked, and died in joy; the dying,<br/>Among the corpses in stark agony lying,<br/>Just heard the happy tidings, and in hope<br/>Closed their faint eyes; from house to house replying<br/>With loud acclaim, the living shook Heaven's cope,<br/>And filled the startled Earth with echoes: morn did ope<br/><br/>Its pale eyes then; and lo! the long array<br/>Of guards in golden arms, and Priests beside,<br/>Singing their bloody hymns, whose garbs betray<br/>The blackness of the faith it seems to hide;<br/>And see, the Tyrant's gem-wrought chariot glide<br/>Among the gloomy cowls and glittering spears--<br/>A Shape of light is sitting by his side,<br/>A child most beautiful. I' the midst appears<br/>Laon,--exempt alone from mortal hopes and fears.<br/><br/>His head and feet are bare, his hands are bound<br/>Behind with heavy chains, yet none do wreak<br/>Their scoffs on him, though myriads throng around;<br/>There are no sneers upon his lip which speak<br/>That scorn or hate has made him bold; his cheek<br/>Resolve has not turned pale,--his eyes are mild<br/>And calm, and, like the morn about to break,<br/>Smile on mankind--his heart seems reconciled<br/>To all things and itself, like a reposing child.<br/><br/>Tumult was in the soul of all beside,<br/>Ill joy, or doubt, or fear; but those who saw<br/>Their tranquil victim pass, felt wonder glide<br/>Into their brain, and became calm with awe.--<br/>See, the slow pageant near the pile doth draw.<br/>A thousand torches in the spacious square,<br/>Borne by the ready slaves of ruthless law,<br/>Await the signal round: the morning fair<br/>Is changed to a dim night by that unnatural glare.<br/><br/>And see! beneath a sun-bright canopy,<br/>Upon a platform level with the pile,<br/>The anxious Tyrant sit, enthroned on high,<br/>Girt by the chieftains of the host; all smile<br/>In expectation, but one child: the while<br/>I, Laon, led by mutes, ascend my bier<br/>Of fire, and look around: each distant isle<br/>Is dark in the bright dawn; towers far and near,<br/>Pierce like reposing flames the tremulous atmosphere.<br/><br/>There was such silence through the host, as when<br/>An earthquake trampling on some populous town,<br/>Has crushed ten thousand with one tread, and men<br/>Expect the second; all were mute but one,<br/>That fairest child, who, bold with love, alone<br/>Stood up before the King, without avail,<br/>Pleading for Laon's life--her stifled groan<br/>Was heard--she trembled like one aspen pale<br/>Among the gloomy pines of a Norwegian vale.<br/><br/>What were his thoughts linked in the morning sun,<br/>Among those reptiles, stingless with delay,<br/>Even like a tyrant's wrath?--The signal-gun<br/>Roared--hark, again! In that dread pause he lay<br/>As in a quiet dream--the slaves obey--<br/>A thousand torches drop,--and hark, the last<br/>Bursts on that awful silence; far away,<br/>Millions, with hearts that beat both loud and fast,<br/>Watch for the springing flame expectant and aghast.<br/><br/>They fly--the torches fall--a cry of fear<br/>Has startled the triumphant!--they recede!<br/>For, ere the cannon's roar has died, they hear<br/>The tramp of hoofs like earthquake, and a steed<br/>Dark and gigantic, with the tempest's speed,<br/>Bursts through their ranks: a woman sits thereon,<br/>Fairer, it seems, than aught that earth can breed,<br/>Calm, radiant, like the phantom of the dawn,<br/>A spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone.<br/><br/>All thought it was God's Angel come to sweep<br/>The lingering guilty to their fiery grave;<br/>The Tyrant from his throne in dread did leap,--<br/>Her innocence his child from fear did save;<br/>Scared by the faith they feigned, each priestly slave<br/>Knelt for his mercy whom they served with blood,<br/>And, like the refluence of a mighty wave<br/>Sucked into the loud sea, the multitude<br/>With crushing panic, fled in terror's altered mood.<br/><br/>They pause, they blush, they gaze,--a gathering shout<br/>Bursts like one sound from the ten thousand streams<br/>Of a tempestuous sea:--that sudden rout<br/>One checked, who, never in his mildest dreams<br/>Felt awe from grace or loveliness, the seams<br/>Of his rent heart so hard and cold a creed<br/>Had seared with blistering ice--but he misdeems<br/>That he is wise, whose wounds do only bleed<br/>Inly for self,--thus thought the Iberian Priest indeed,<br/><br/>And others, too, thought he was wise to see,<br/>In pain, and fear, and hate, something divine;<br/>In love and beauty, no divinity.--<br/>Now with a bitter smile, whose light did shine<br/>Like a fiend's hope upon his lips and eyne,<br/>He said, and the persuasion of that sneer<br/>Rallied his trembling comrades--'Is it mine<br/>To stand alone, when kings and soldiers fear<br/>A woman? Heaven has sent its other victim here.'<br/><br/>'Were it not impious,' said the King, 'to break<br/>Our holy oath?'--'Impious to keep it, say!'<br/>Shrieked the exulting Priest:--'Slaves, to the stake<br/>Bind her, and on my head the burden lay<br/>Of her just torments:--at the Judgement Day<br/>Will I stand up before the golden throne<br/>Of Heaven, and cry, "To Thee did I betray<br/>An infidel; but for me she would have known<br/>Another moment's joy! the glory be thine own."'<br/><br/>They trembled, but replied not, nor obeyed,<br/>Pausing in breathless silence. Cythna sprung<br/>From her gigantic steed, who, like a shade<br/>Chased by the winds, those vacant streets among<br/>Fled tameless, as the brazen rein she flung<br/>Upon his neck, and kissed his mooned brow.<br/>A piteous sight, that one so fair and young,<br/>The clasp of such a fearful death should woo<br/>With smiles of tender joy as beamed from Cythna now.<br/><br/>The warm tears burst in spite of faith and fear<br/>From many a tremulous eye, but like soft dews<br/>Which feed Spring's earliest buds, hung gathered there,<br/>Frozen by doubt,--alas! they could not choose<br/>But weep; for when her faint limbs did refuse<br/>To climb the pyre, upon the mutes she smiled;<br/>And with her eloquent gestures, and the hues<br/>Of her quick lips, even as a weary child<br/>Wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild,<br/><br/>She won them, though unwilling, her to bind<br/>Near me, among the snakes. When there had fled<br/>One soft reproach that was most thrilling kind,<br/>She smiled on me, and nothing then we said,<br/>But each upon the other's countenance fed<br/>Looks of insatiate love; the mighty veil<br/>Which doth divide the living and the dead<br/>Was almost rent, the world grew dim and pale,--<br/>All light in Heaven or Earth beside our love did fail.--<br/><br/>Yet--yet--one brief relapse, like the last beam<br/>Of dying flames, the stainless air around<br/>Hung silent and serene--a blood-red gleam<br/>Burst upwards, hurling fiercely from the ground<br/>The globed smoke,--I heard the mighty sound<br/>Of its uprise, like a tempestuous ocean;<br/>And through its chasms I saw, as in a swound,<br/>The tyrant's child fall without life or motion<br/>Before his throne, subdued by some unseen emotion.--<br/><br/>And is this death?--The pyre has disappeared,<br/>The Pestilence, the Tyrant, and the throng;<br/>The flames grow silent--slowly there is heard<br/>The music of a breath-suspending song,<br/>Which, like the kiss of love when life is young,<br/>Steeps the faint eyes in darkness sweet and deep;<br/>With ever-changing notes it floats along,<br/>Till on my passive soul there seemed to creep<br/>A melody, like waves on wrinkled sands that leap.<br/><br/>The warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand<br/>Wakened me then; lo! Cythna sate reclined<br/>Beside me, on the waved and golden sand<br/>Of a clear pool, upon a bank o'ertwined<br/>With strange and star-bright flowers, which to the wind<br/>Breathed divine odour; high above, was spread<br/>The emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind,<br/>Whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead<br/>A shadow, which was light, upon the waters shed.<br/><br/>And round about sloped many a lawny mountain<br/>With incense-bearing forests and vast caves<br/>Of marble radiance, to that mighty fountain;<br/>And where the flood its own bright margin laves,<br/>Their echoes talk with its eternal waves,<br/>Which, from the depths whose jagged caverns breed<br/>Their unreposing strife, it lifts and heaves,--<br/>Till through a chasm of hills they roll, and feed<br/>A river deep, which flies with smooth but arrowy speed.<br/><br/>As we sate gazing in a trance of wonder,<br/>A boat approached, borne by the musical air<br/>Along the waves which sung and sparkled under<br/>Its rapid keel--a winged shape sate there,<br/>A child with silver-shining wings, so fair,<br/>That as her bark did through the waters glide,<br/>The shadow of the lingering waves did wear<br/>Light, as from starry beams; from side to side,<br/>While veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide.<br/><br/>The boat was one curved shell of hollow pearl,<br/>Almost translucent with the light divine<br/>Of her within; the prow and stern did curl<br/>Horned on high, like the young moon supine,<br/>When o'er dim twilight mountains dark with pine,<br/>It floats upon the sunset's sea of beams,<br/>Whose golden waves in many a purple line<br/>Fade fast, till borne on sunlight's ebbing streams,<br/>Dilating, on earth's verge the sunken meteor gleams.<br/><br/>Its keel has struck the sands beside our feet;--<br/>Then Cythna turned to me, and from her eyes<br/>Which swam with unshed tears, a look more sweet<br/>Than happy love, a wild and glad surprise,<br/>Glanced as she spake: 'Ay, this is Paradise<br/>And not a dream, and we are all united!<br/>Lo, that is mine own child, who in the guise<br/>Of madness came, like day to one benighted<br/>In lonesome woods: my heart is now too well requited!'<br/><br/>And then she wept aloud, and in her arms<br/>Clasped that bright Shape, less marvellously fair<br/>Than her own human hues and living charms;<br/>Which, as she leaned in passion's silence there,<br/>Breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air,<br/>Which seemed to blush and tremble with delight;<br/>The glossy darkness of her streaming hair<br/>Fell o'er that snowy child, and wrapped from sight<br/>The fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite.<br/><br/>Then the bright child, the plumed Seraph came,<br/>And fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine,<br/>And said, 'I was disturbed by tremulous shame<br/>When once we met, yet knew that I was thine<br/>From the same hour in which thy lips divine<br/>Kindled a clinging dream within my brain,<br/>Which ever waked when I might sleep, to twine<br/>Thine image with HER memory dear--again<br/>We meet; exempted now from mortal fear or pain.<br/><br/>'When the consuming flames had wrapped ye round,<br/>The hope which I had cherished went away;<br/>I fell in agony on the senseless ground,<br/>And hid mine eyes in dust, and far astray<br/>My mind was gone, when bright, like dawning day,<br/>The Spectre of the Plague before me flew,<br/>And breathed upon my lips, and seemed to say,<br/>"They wait for thee, beloved!"--then I knew<br/>The death-mark on my breast, and became calm anew.<br/><br/>'It was the calm of love--for I was dying.<br/>I saw the black and half-extinguished pyre<br/>In its own gray and shrunken ashes lying;<br/>The pitchy smoke of the departed fire<br/>Still hung in many a hollow dome and spire<br/>Above the towers, like night,--beneath whose shade<br/>Awed by the ending of their own desire<br/>The armies stood; a vacancy was made<br/>In expectation's depth, and so they stood dismayed.<br/><br/>'The frightful silence of that altered mood,<br/>The tortures of the dying clove alone,<br/>Till one uprose among the multitude,<br/>And said--"The flood of time is rolling on;<br/>We stand upon its brink, whilst THEY are gone<br/>To glide in peace down death's mysterious stream.<br/>Have ye done well? They moulder, flesh and bone,<br/>Who might have made this life's envenomed dream<br/>A sweeter draught than ye will ever taste, I deem.<br/><br/>'"These perish as the good and great of yore<br/>Have perished, and their murderers will repent,--<br/>Yes, vain and barren tears shall flow before<br/>Yon smoke has faded from the firmament<br/>Even for this cause, that ye who must lament<br/>The death of those that made this world so fair,<br/>Cannot recall them now; but there is lent<br/>To man the wisdom of a high despair,<br/>When such can die, and he live on and linger here.<br/><br/>'"Ay, ye may fear not now the Pestilence,<br/>From fabled hell as by a charm withdrawn;<br/>All power and faith must pass, since calmly hence<br/>In pain and fire have unbelievers gone;<br/>And ye must sadly turn away, and moan<br/>In secret, to his home each one returning;<br/>And to long ages shall this hour be known;<br/>And slowly shall its memory, ever burning,<br/>Fill this dark night of things with an eternal morning.<br/><br/>'"For me that world is grown too void and cold,<br/>Since Hope pursues immortal Destiny<br/>With steps thus slow--therefore shall ye behold<br/>How those who love, yet fear not, dare to die;<br/>Tell to your children this!" Then suddenly<br/>He sheathed a dagger in his heart and fell;<br/>My brain grew dark in death, and yet to me<br/>There came a murmur from the crowd, to tell<br/>Of deep and mighty change which suddenly befell.<br/><br/>'Then suddenly I stood, a winged Thought,<br/>Before the immortal Senate, and the seat<br/>Of that star-shining spirit, whence is wrought<br/>The strength of its dominion, good and great,<br/>The better Genius of this world's estate.<br/>His realm around one mighty Fane is spread,<br/>Elysian islands bright and fortunate,<br/>Calm dwellings of the free and happy dead,<br/>Where I am sent to lead!' These winged words she said,<br/><br/>And with the silence of her eloquent smile,<br/>Bade us embark in her divine canoe;<br/>Then at the helm we took our seat, the while<br/>Above her head those plumes of dazzling hue<br/>Into the winds' invisible stream she threw,<br/>Sitting beside the prow: like gossamer<br/>On the swift breath of morn, the vessel flew<br/>O'er the bright whirlpools of that fountain fair,<br/>Whose shores receded fast, while we seemed lingering there;<br/><br/>Till down that mighty stream, dark, calm, and fleet,<br/>Between a chasm of cedarn mountains riven,<br/>Chased by the thronging winds whose viewless feet<br/>As swift as twinkling beams, had, under Heaven,<br/>From woods and waves wild sounds and odours driven,<br/>The boat fled visibly--three nights and days,<br/>Borne like a cloud through morn, and noon, and even,<br/>We sailed along the winding watery ways<br/>Of the vast stream, a long and labyrinthine maze.<br/><br/>A scene of joy and wonder to behold<br/>That river's shapes and shadows changing ever,<br/>Where the broad sunrise filled with deepening gold<br/>Its whirlpools, where all hues did spread and quiver;<br/>And where melodious falls did burst and shiver<br/>Among rocks clad with flowers, the foam and spray<br/>Sparkled like stars upon the sunny river,<br/>Or when the moonlight poured a holier day,<br/>One vast and glittering lake around green islands lay.<br/><br/>Morn, noon, and even, that boat of pearl outran<br/>The streams which bore it, like the arrowy cloud<br/>Of tempest, or the speedier thought of man,<br/>Which flieth forth and cannot make abode;<br/>Sometimes through forests, deep like night, we glode,<br/>Between the walls of mighty mountains crowned<br/>With Cyclopean piles, whose turrets proud,<br/>The homes of the departed, dimly frowned<br/>O'er the bright waves which girt their dark foundations round.<br/><br/>Sometimes between the wide and flowering meadows,<br/>Mile after mile we sailed, and 'twas delight<br/>To see far off the sunbeams chase the shadows<br/>Over the grass; sometimes beneath the night<br/>Of wide and vaulted caves, whose roofs were bright<br/>With starry gems, we fled, whilst from their deep<br/>And dark-green chasms, shades beautiful and white,<br/>Amid sweet sounds across our path would sweep,<br/>Like swift and lovely dreams that walk the waves of sleep.<br/><br/>And ever as we sailed, our minds were full<br/>Of love and wisdom, which would overflow<br/>In converse wild, and sweet, and wonderful,<br/>And in quick smiles whose light would come and go<br/>Like music o'er wide waves, and in the flow<br/>Of sudden tears, and in the mute caress--<br/>For a deep shade was cleft, and we did know,<br/>That virtue, though obscured on Earth, not less<br/>Survives all mortal change in lasting loveliness.<br/><br/>Three days and nights we sailed, as thought and feeling<br/>Number delightful hours--for through the sky<br/>The sphered lamps of day and night, revealing<br/>New changes and new glories, rolled on high,<br/>Sun, Moon and moonlike lamps, the progeny<br/>Of a diviner Heaven, serene and fair:<br/>On the fourth day, wild as a windwrought sea<br/>The stream became, and fast and faster bare<br/>The spirit-winged boat, steadily speeding there.<br/><br/>Steady and swift, where the waves rolled like mountains<br/>Within the vast ravine, whose rifts did pour<br/>Tumultuous floods from their ten thousand fountains,<br/>The thunder of whose earth-uplifting roar<br/>Made the air sweep in whirlwinds from the shore,<br/>Calm as a shade, the boat of that fair child<br/>Securely fled, that rapid stress before,<br/>Amid the topmost spray, and sunbows wild,<br/>Wreathed in the silver mist: in joy and pride we smiled.<br/><br/>The torrent of that wide and raging river<br/>Is passed, and our aereal speed suspended.<br/>We look behind; a golden mist did quiver<br/>When its wild surges with the lake were blended,--<br/>Our bark hung there, as on a line suspended<br/>Between two heavens,--that windless waveless lake<br/>Which four great cataracts from four vales, attended<br/>By mists, aye feed; from rocks and clouds they break,<br/>And of that azure sea a silent refuge make.<br/><br/>Motionless resting on the lake awhile,<br/>I saw its marge of snow-bright mountains rear<br/>Their peaks aloft, I saw each radiant isle,<br/>And in the midst, afar, even like a sphere<br/>Hung in one hollow sky, did there appear<br/>The Temple of the Spirit; on the sound<br/>Which issued thence, drawn nearer and more near,<br/>Like the swift moon this glorious earth around,<br/>The charmed boat approached, and there its haven found.
