# üíÆ The Flower by *George Herbert*

<p>
    How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean<br/>Are thy returns! ev'n as the flowers in spring;<br/>To which, besides their own demean,<br/>The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.<br/>Grief melts away<br/>Like snows in May,<br/>As if there were no such cold thing.<br/><br/>Who would have thought my shrivelled heart<br/>Could have recovered greenness? It was gone<br/>Quite under ground; as flowers depart<br/>To see their mother-root, when they have blown;<br/>Where they together<br/>All the hard weather,<br/>Dead to the world, keep house unknown.<br/><br/>These are thy wonders, Lord of power,<br/>Killing and quick'ning, bringing down to hell<br/>And up to heaven in an hour;<br/>Making a chiming of a passing-bell.<br/>We say amiss,<br/>This or that is:<br/>Thy word is all, if we could spell.<br/><br/>O that I once past changing were,<br/>Fast in thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!<br/>Many a spring I shoot up fair,<br/>Off'ring at heav'n, growing and groaning thither:<br/>Nor doth my flower<br/>Want a spring shower,<br/>My sins and I joining together.<br/><br/>But while I grow in a straight line,<br/>Still upwards bent, as if heav'n were mine own,<br/>Thy anger comes, and I decline:<br/>What frost to that? What pole is not the zone,<br/>Where all things burn,<br/>When thou dost turn,<br/>And the least frown of thine is shown?<br/><br/>And now in age I bud again,<br/>After so many deaths I live and write;<br/>I once more smell the dew and rain,<br/>And relish versing: O my only light,<br/>It cannot be<br/>That I am he<br/>On whom thy tempests fell all night.<br/><br/>These are thy wonders, Lord of love,<br/>To make us see we are but flowers that glide;<br/>Which when we once can find and prove,<br/>Thou hast a garden for us, where to bide.<br/>Who would be more,<br/>Swelling through store,<br/>Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.
</p>
