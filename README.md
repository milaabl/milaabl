# üíÆ 25. My Father was a Farmer: A Ballad by *Robert Burns*

<p>
    MY father was a farmer upon the Carrick border, O,<br/>And carefully he bred me in decency and order, O;<br/>He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne‚Äôer a farthing, O;<br/>For without an honest manly heart, no man was worth regarding, O.<br/><br/><br/>Then out into the world my course I did determine, O;<br/>Tho‚Äô to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming, O;<br/>My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education, O:<br/>Resolv‚Äôd was I at least to try to mend my situation, O.<br/><br/><br/>In many a way, and vain essay, I courted Fortune‚Äôs favour, O;<br/>Some cause unseen still stept between, to frustrate each endeavour, O;<br/>Sometimes by foes I was o‚Äôerpower‚Äôd, sometimes by friends forsaken, O;<br/>And when my hope was at the top, I still was worst mistaken, O.<br/><br/><br/>Then sore harass‚Äôd and tir‚Äôd at last, with Fortune‚Äôs vain delusion, O,<br/>I dropt my schemes, like idle dreams, and came to this conclusion, O;<br/>The past was bad, and the future hid, its good or ill untried, O;<br/>But the present hour was in my pow‚Äôr, and so I would enjoy it, O.<br/><br/><br/>No help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O;<br/>So I must toil, and sweat, and moil, and labour to sustain me, O;<br/>To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O;<br/>For one, he said, to labour bred, was a match for Fortune fairly, O.<br/><br/><br/>Thus all obscure, unknown, and poor, thro‚Äô life I‚Äôm doom‚Äôd to wander, O,<br/>Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O:<br/>No view nor care, but shun whate‚Äôer might breed me pain or sorrow, O;<br/>I live to-day as well‚Äôs I may, regardless of to-morrow, O.<br/><br/><br/>But cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in his palace, O,<br/>Tho‚Äô Fortune‚Äôs frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O:<br/>I make indeed my daily bread, but ne‚Äôer can make it farther, O:<br/>But as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O.<br/><br/><br/>When sometimes by my labour, I earn a little money, O,<br/>Some unforeseen misfortune comes gen‚Äôrally upon me, O;<br/>Mischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my goodnatur‚Äôd folly, O:<br/>But come what will, I‚Äôve sworn it still, I‚Äôll ne‚Äôer be melancholy, O.<br/><br/><br/>All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O,<br/>The more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O:<br/>Had you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O,<br/>A cheerful honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O.
