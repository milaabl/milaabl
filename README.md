# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Man of Law's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>Our Hoste saw well that the brighte sun<br/>Th' arc of his artificial day had run<br/>The fourthe part, and half an houre more;<br/>And, though he were not deep expert in lore,<br/>He wist it was the eight-and-twenty day<br/>Of April, that is messenger to May;<br/>And saw well that the shadow of every tree<br/>Was in its length of the same quantity<br/>That was the body erect that caused it;<br/>And therefore by the shadow he took his wit,<br/>That Phoebus, which that shone so clear and bright,<br/>Degrees was five-and-forty clomb on height;<br/>And for that day, as in that latitude,<br/>It was ten of the clock, he gan conclude;<br/>And suddenly he plight his horse about.<br/><br/>"Lordings," quoth he, "I warn you all this rout,<br/>The fourthe partie of this day is gone.<br/>Now for the love of God and of Saint John<br/>Lose no time, as farforth as ye may.<br/>Lordings, the time wasteth night and day,<br/>And steals from us, what privily sleeping,<br/>And what through negligence in our waking,<br/>As doth the stream, that turneth never again,<br/>Descending from the mountain to the plain.<br/>Well might Senec, and many a philosopher,<br/>Bewaile time more than gold in coffer.<br/>For loss of chattels may recover'd be,<br/>But loss of time shendeth us, quoth he.<br/><br/>It will not come again, withoute dread,<br/>No more than will Malkin's maidenhead,<br/>When she hath lost it in her wantonness.<br/>Let us not moulde thus in idleness.<br/>"Sir Man of Law," quoth he, "so have ye bliss,<br/>Tell us a tale anon, as forword is.<br/>Ye be submitted through your free assent<br/>To stand in this case at my judgement.<br/>Acquit you now, and holde your behest;<br/>Then have ye done your devoir at the least."<br/>"Hoste," quoth he, "de par dieux jeo asente;<br/>To breake forword is not mine intent.<br/>Behest is debt, and I would hold it fain,<br/>All my behest; I can no better sayn.<br/>For such law as a man gives another wight,<br/>He should himselfe usen it by right.<br/>Thus will our text: but natheless certain<br/>I can right now no thrifty tale sayn,<br/>But Chaucer (though he can but lewedly<br/>On metres and on rhyming craftily)<br/>Hath said them, in such English as he can,<br/>Of olde time, as knoweth many a man.<br/>And if he have not said them, leve brother,<br/>In one book, he hath said them in another<br/>For he hath told of lovers up and down,<br/>More than Ovide made of mentioun<br/>In his Epistolae, that be full old.<br/>Why should I telle them, since they he told?<br/>In youth he made of Ceyx and Alcyon,<br/>And since then he hath spoke of every one<br/>These noble wives, and these lovers eke.<br/>Whoso that will his large volume seek<br/>Called the Saintes' Legend of Cupid:<br/>There may he see the large woundes wide<br/>Of Lucrece, and of Babylon Thisbe;<br/>The sword of Dido for the false Enee;<br/>The tree of Phillis for her Demophon;<br/>The plaint of Diane, and of Hermion,<br/>Of Ariadne, and Hypsipile;<br/>The barren isle standing in the sea;<br/>The drown'd Leander for his fair Hero;<br/>The teares of Helene, and eke the woe<br/>Of Briseis, and Laodamia;<br/>The cruelty of thee, Queen Medea,<br/>Thy little children hanging by the halse,<br/>For thy Jason, that was of love so false.<br/>Hypermnestra, Penelop', Alcest',<br/>Your wifehood he commendeth with the best.<br/>But certainly no worde writeth he<br/>Of thilke wick' example of Canace,<br/>That loved her own brother sinfully;<br/>(Of all such cursed stories I say, Fy),<br/>Or else of Tyrius Apollonius,<br/>How that the cursed king Antiochus<br/>Bereft his daughter of her maidenhead;<br/>That is so horrible a tale to read,<br/>When he her threw upon the pavement.<br/>And therefore he, of full avisement,<br/>Would never write in none of his sermons<br/>Of such unkind abominations;<br/>Nor I will none rehearse, if that I may.<br/>But of my tale how shall I do this day?<br/>Me were loth to be liken'd doubteless<br/>To Muses, that men call Pierides<br/>(Metamorphoseos  wot what I mean),<br/>But natheless I recke not a bean,<br/>Though I come after him with hawebake;<br/>I speak in prose, and let him rhymes make."<br/>And with that word, he with a sober cheer<br/>Began his tale, and said as ye shall hear.<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>O scatheful harm, condition of poverty,<br/>With thirst, with cold, with hunger so confounded;<br/>To aske help thee shameth in thine hearte;<br/>If thou none ask, so sore art thou y-wounded,<br/>That very need unwrappeth all thy wound hid.<br/>Maugre thine head thou must for indigence<br/>Or steal, or beg, or borrow thy dispence.<br/><br/>Thou blamest Christ, and sayst full bitterly,<br/>He misdeparteth riches temporal;<br/>Thy neighebour thou witest sinfully,<br/>And sayst, thou hast too little, and he hath all:<br/>"Parfay (sayst thou) sometime he reckon shall,<br/>When that his tail shall brennen in the glede,<br/>For he not help'd the needful in their need."<br/><br/>Hearken what is the sentence of the wise:<br/>Better to die than to have indigence.<br/>Thy selve neighebour will thee despise,<br/>If thou be poor, farewell thy reverence.<br/>Yet of the wise man take this sentence,<br/>Alle the days of poore men be wick',<br/>Beware therefore ere thou come to that prick.<br/><br/>If thou be poor, thy brother hateth thee,<br/>And all thy friendes flee from thee, alas!<br/>O riche merchants, full of wealth be ye,<br/>O noble, prudent folk, as in this case,<br/>Your bagges be not fill'd with ambes ace,<br/>But with six-cinque, that runneth for your chance;<br/>At Christenmass well merry may ye dance.<br/><br/>Ye seeke land and sea for your winnings,<br/>As wise folk ye knowen all th' estate<br/>Of regnes; ye be fathers of tidings,<br/>And tales, both of peace and of debate:<br/>I were right now of tales desolate,<br/>But that a merchant, gone in many a year,<br/>Me taught a tale, which ye shall after hear.<br/><br/>In Syria whilom dwelt a company<br/>Of chapmen rich, and thereto sad and true,<br/>Clothes of gold, and satins rich of hue.<br/>That widewhere sent their spicery,<br/>Their chaffare was so thriftly and so new,<br/>That every wight had dainty to chaffare<br/>With them, and eke to selle them their ware.<br/><br/>Now fell it, that the masters of that sort<br/>Have shapen them to Rome for to wend,<br/>Were it for chapmanhood or for disport,<br/>None other message would they thither send,<br/>But come themselves to Rome, this is the end:<br/>And in such place as thought them a vantage<br/>For their intent, they took their herbergage.<br/><br/>Sojourned have these merchants in that town<br/>A certain time as fell to their pleasance:<br/>And so befell, that th' excellent renown<br/>Of th' emperore's daughter, Dame Constance,<br/>Reported was, with every circumstance,<br/>Unto these Syrian merchants in such wise,<br/>From day to day, as I shall you devise<br/><br/>This was the common voice of every man<br/>"Our emperor of Rome, God him see,<br/>A daughter hath, that since the the world began,<br/>To reckon as well her goodness and beauty,<br/>Was never such another as is she:<br/>I pray to God in honour her sustene,<br/>And would she were of all Europe the queen.<br/><br/>"In her is highe beauty without pride,<br/>And youth withoute greenhood or folly:<br/>To all her workes virtue is her guide;<br/>Humbless hath slain in her all tyranny:<br/>She is the mirror of all courtesy,<br/>Her heart a very chamber of holiness,<br/>Her hand minister of freedom for almess."<br/><br/>And all this voice was sooth, as God is true;<br/>But now to purpose let us turn again.<br/>These merchants have done freight their shippes new,<br/>And when they have this blissful maiden seen,<br/>Home to Syria then they went full fain,<br/>And did their needes, as they have done yore,<br/>And liv'd in weal; I can you say no more.<br/><br/>Now fell it, that these merchants stood in grace<br/>Of him that was the Soudan of Syrie:<br/>For when they came from any strange place<br/>He would of his benigne courtesy<br/>Make them good cheer, and busily espy<br/>Tidings of sundry regnes, for to lear<br/>The wonders that they mighte see or hear.<br/><br/>Amonges other thinges, specially<br/>These merchants have him told of Dame Constance<br/>So great nobless, in earnest so royally,<br/>That this Soudan hath caught so great pleasance<br/>To have her figure in his remembrance,<br/>That all his lust, and all his busy cure,<br/>Was for to love her while his life may dure.<br/><br/>Paraventure in thilke large book,<br/>Which that men call the heaven, y-written was<br/>With starres, when that he his birthe took,<br/>That he for love should have his death, alas!<br/>For in the starres, clearer than is glass,<br/>Is written, God wot, whoso could it read,<br/>The death of every man withoute dread.<br/><br/>In starres many a winter therebeforn<br/>Was writ the death of Hector, Achilles,<br/>Of Pompey, Julius, ere they were born;<br/>The strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,<br/>Of Samson, Turnus, and of Socrates<br/>The death; but mennes wittes be so dull,<br/>That no wight can well read it at the full.<br/><br/>This Soudan for his privy council sent,<br/>And, shortly of this matter for to pace,<br/>He hath to them declared his intent,<br/>And told them certain, but he might have grace<br/>To have Constance, within a little space,<br/>He was but dead; and charged them in hie<br/>To shape for his life some remedy.<br/><br/>Diverse men diverse thinges said;<br/>And arguments they casten up and down;<br/>Many a subtle reason forth they laid;<br/>They speak of magic, and abusion;<br/>But finally, as in conclusion,<br/>They cannot see in that none avantage,<br/>Nor in no other way, save marriage.<br/><br/>Then saw they therein such difficulty<br/>By way of reason, for to speak all plain,<br/>Because that there was such diversity<br/>Between their bothe lawes, that they sayn,<br/>They trowe that no Christian prince would fain<br/>Wedden his child under our lawe sweet,<br/>That us was given by Mahound our prophete.<br/><br/>And he answered: "Rather than I lose<br/>Constance, I will be christen'd doubteless<br/>I must be hers, I may none other choose,<br/>I pray you hold your arguments in peace,<br/>Save my life, and be not reckeless<br/>To gette her that hath my life in cure,<br/>For in this woe I may not long endure."<br/><br/>What needeth greater dilatation?<br/>I say, by treaty and ambassadry,<br/>And by the Pope's mediation,<br/>And all the Church, and all the chivalry,<br/>That in destruction of Mah'metry,<br/>And in increase of Christe's lawe dear,<br/>They be accorded so as ye may hear;<br/><br/>How that the Soudan, and his baronage,<br/>And all his lieges, shall y-christen'd be,<br/>And he shall have Constance in marriage,<br/>And certain gold, I n'ot what quantity,<br/>And hereto find they suffisant surety.<br/>The same accord is sworn on either side;<br/>Now, fair Constance, Almighty God thee guide!<br/><br/>Now woulde some men waiten, as I guess,<br/>That I should tellen all the purveyance,<br/>The which the emperor of his noblesse<br/>Hath shapen for his daughter, Dame Constance.<br/>Well may men know that so great ordinance<br/>May no man tellen in a little clause,<br/>As was arrayed for so high a cause.<br/><br/>Bishops be shapen with her for to wend,<br/>Lordes, ladies, and knightes of renown,<br/>And other folk enough, this is the end.<br/>And notified is throughout all the town,<br/>That every wight with great devotioun<br/>Should pray to Christ, that he this marriage<br/>Receive in gree, and speede this voyage.<br/><br/>The day is comen of her departing, --<br/>I say the woful fatal day is come,<br/>That there may be no longer tarrying,<br/>But forward they them dressen all and some.<br/>Constance, that was with sorrow all o'ercome,<br/>Full pale arose, and dressed her to wend,<br/>For well she saw there was no other end.<br/><br/>Alas! what wonder is it though she wept,<br/>That shall be sent to a strange nation<br/>From friendes, that so tenderly her kept,<br/>And to be bound under subjection<br/>of one, she knew not his condition?<br/>Husbands be all good, and have been of yore,<br/>That knowe wives; I dare say no more.<br/><br/>"Father," she said, "thy wretched child Constance,<br/>Thy younge daughter, foster'd up so soft,<br/>And you, my mother, my sov'reign pleasance<br/>Over all thing, out-taken Christ on loft,<br/>Constance your child her recommendeth oft<br/>Unto your grace; for I shall to Syrie,<br/>Nor shall I ever see you more with eye.<br/><br/>"Alas! unto the barbarous nation<br/>I must anon, since that it is your will:<br/>But Christ, that starf for our redemption,<br/>So give me grace his hestes to fulfil.<br/>I, wretched woman, no force though I spill!<br/>Women are born to thraldom and penance,<br/>And to be under mannes governance."<br/><br/>I trow at Troy when Pyrrhus brake the wall,<br/>Or Ilion burnt, or Thebes the city,<br/>Nor at Rome for the harm through Hannibal,<br/>That Romans hath y-vanquish'd times three,<br/>Was heard such tender weeping for pity,<br/>As in the chamber was for her parting;<br/>But forth she must, whether she weep or sing.<br/><br/>O firste moving cruel Firmament,<br/>With thy diurnal sway that crowdest aye,<br/>And hurtlest all from East till Occident<br/>That naturally would hold another way;<br/>Thy crowding set the heav'n in such array<br/>At the beginning of this fierce voyage,<br/>That cruel Mars hath slain this marriage.<br/><br/>Unfortunate ascendant tortuous,<br/>Of which the lord is helpless fall'n, alas!<br/>Out of his angle into the darkest house;<br/>O Mars, O Atyzar, as in this case;<br/>O feeble Moon, unhappy is thy pace.<br/>Thou knittest thee where thou art not receiv'd,<br/>Where thou wert well, from thennes art thou weiv'd.<br/><br/>Imprudent emperor of Rome, alas!<br/>Was there no philosopher in all thy town?<br/>Is no time bet than other in such case?<br/>Of voyage is there none election,<br/>Namely to folk of high condition,<br/>Not when a root is of a birth y-know?<br/>Alas! we be too lewed, or too slow.<br/><br/>To ship was brought this woeful faire maid<br/>Solemnely, with every circumstance:<br/>"Now Jesus Christ be with you all," she said.<br/>There is no more,but "Farewell, fair Constance."<br/>She pained her to make good countenance.<br/>And forth I let her sail in this manner,<br/>And turn I will again to my matter.<br/><br/>The mother of the Soudan, well of vices,<br/>Espied hath her sone's plain intent,<br/>How he will leave his olde sacrifices:<br/>And right anon she for her council sent,<br/>And they be come, to knowe what she meant,<br/>And when assembled was this folk in fere,<br/>She sat her down, and said as ye shall hear.<br/><br/>"Lordes," she said, "ye knowen every one,<br/>How that my son in point is for to lete<br/>The holy lawes of our Alkaron,<br/>Given by God's messenger Mahomete:<br/>But one avow to greate God I hete,<br/>Life shall rather out of my body start,<br/>Than Mahomet's law go out of mine heart.<br/><br/>"What should us tiden of this newe law,<br/>But thraldom to our bodies, and penance,<br/>And afterward in hell to be y-draw,<br/>For we renied Mahound our creance?<br/>But, lordes, will ye maken assurance,<br/>As I shall say, assenting to my lore?<br/>And I shall make us safe for evermore."<br/><br/>They sworen and assented every man<br/>To live with her and die, and by her stand:<br/>And every one, in the best wise he can,<br/>To strengthen her shall all his friendes fand.<br/>And she hath this emprise taken in hand,<br/>Which ye shall heare that I shall devise;<br/>And to them all she spake right in this wise.<br/><br/>"We shall first feign us Christendom to take;<br/>Cold water shall not grieve us but a lite:<br/>And I shall such a feast and revel make,<br/>That, as I trow, I shall the Soudan quite.<br/>For though his wife be christen'd ne'er so white,<br/>She shall have need to wash away the red,<br/>Though she a fount of water with her led."<br/><br/>O Soudaness, root of iniquity,<br/>Virago thou, Semiramis the second!<br/>O serpent under femininity,<br/>Like to the serpent deep in hell y-bound!<br/>O feigned woman, all that may confound<br/>Virtue and innocence, through thy malice,<br/>Is bred in thee, as nest of every vice!<br/><br/>O Satan envious! since thilke day<br/>That thou wert chased from our heritage,<br/>Well knowest thou to woman th' olde way.<br/>Thou madest Eve to bring us in servage:<br/>Thou wilt fordo this Christian marriage:<br/>Thine instrument so (well-away the while!)<br/>Mak'st thou of women when thou wilt beguile.<br/><br/>This Soudaness, whom I thus blame and warray,<br/>Let privily her council go their way:<br/>Why should I in this tale longer tarry?<br/>She rode unto the Soudan on a day,<br/>And said him, that she would reny her lay,<br/>And Christendom of priestes' handes fong,<br/>Repenting her she heathen was so long;<br/><br/>Beseeching him to do her that honour,<br/>That she might have the Christian folk to feast:<br/>"To please them I will do my labour."<br/>The Soudan said, "I will do at your hest,"<br/>And kneeling, thanked her for that request;<br/>So glad he was, he wist not what to say.<br/>She kiss'd her son, and home she went her way.<br/><br/>Arrived be these Christian folk to land<br/>In Syria, with a great solemne rout,<br/>And hastily this Soudan sent his sond,<br/>First to his mother, and all the realm about,<br/>And said, his wife was comen out of doubt,<br/>And pray'd them for to ride again the queen,<br/>The honour of his regne to sustene.<br/><br/>Great was the press, and rich was the array<br/>Of Syrians and Romans met in fere.<br/>The mother of the Soudan rich and gay<br/>Received her with all so glad a cheer<br/>As any mother might her daughter dear<br/>And to the nexte city there beside<br/>A softe pace solemnely they ride.<br/><br/>Nought, trow I, the triumph of Julius<br/>Of which that Lucan maketh such a boast,<br/>Was royaller, or more curious,<br/>Than was th' assembly of this blissful host<br/>But O this scorpion, this wicked ghost,<br/>The Soudaness, for all her flattering<br/>Cast under this full mortally to sting.<br/><br/>The Soudan came himself soon after this,<br/>So royally, that wonder is to tell,<br/>And welcomed her with all joy and bliss.<br/>And thus in mirth and joy I let them dwell.<br/>The fruit of his matter is that I tell;<br/>When the time came, men thought it for the best<br/>That revel stint, and men go to their rest.<br/><br/>The time is come that this old Soudaness<br/>Ordained hath the feast of which I told,<br/>And to the feast the Christian folk them dress<br/>In general, yea, bothe young and old.<br/>There may men feast and royalty behold,<br/>And dainties more than I can you devise;<br/>But all too dear they bought it ere they rise.<br/><br/>O sudden woe, that ev'r art successour<br/>To worldly bliss! sprent is with bitterness<br/>Th' end of our joy, of our worldly labour;<br/>Woe occupies the fine of our gladness.<br/>Hearken this counsel, for thy sickerness:<br/>Upon thy glade days have in thy mind<br/>The unware woe of harm, that comes behind.<br/><br/>For, shortly for to tell it at a word,<br/>The Soudan and the Christians every one<br/>Were all to-hewn and sticked at the board,<br/>But it were only Dame Constance alone.<br/>This olde Soudaness, this cursed crone,<br/>Had with her friendes done this cursed deed,<br/>For she herself would all the country lead.<br/><br/>Nor there was Syrian that was converted,<br/>That of the counsel of the Soudan wot,<br/>That was not all to-hewn, ere he asterted:<br/>And Constance have they ta'en anon foot-hot,<br/>And in a ship all steereless, God wot,<br/>They have her set, and bid her learn to sail<br/>Out of Syria again-ward to Itale.<br/><br/>A certain treasure that she thither lad,<br/>And, sooth to say, of victual great plenty,<br/>They have her giv'n, and clothes eke she had<br/>And forth she sailed in the salte sea:<br/>O my Constance, full of benignity,<br/>O emperores younge daughter dear,<br/>He that is lord of fortune be thy steer!<br/><br/>She bless'd herself, and with full piteous voice<br/>Unto the cross of Christ thus saide she;<br/>"O dear, O wealful altar, holy cross,<br/>Red of the Lambes blood, full of pity,<br/>That wash'd the world from old iniquity,<br/>Me from the fiend and from his clawes keep,<br/>That day that I shall drenchen in the deepe.<br/><br/>"Victorious tree, protection of the true,<br/>That only worthy were for to bear<br/>The King of Heaven, with his woundes new,<br/>The white Lamb, that hurt was with a spear;<br/>Flemer of fiendes out of him and her<br/>On which thy limbes faithfully extend,<br/>Me keep, and give me might my life to mend."<br/><br/>Yeares and days floated this creature<br/>Throughout the sea of Greece, unto the strait<br/>Of Maroc, as it was her a venture:<br/>On many a sorry meal now may she bait,<br/>After her death full often may she wait,<br/>Ere that the wilde waves will her drive<br/>Unto the place there as she shall arrive.<br/><br/>Men mighten aske, why she was not slain?<br/>Eke at the feast who might her body save?<br/>And I answer to that demand again,<br/>Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave,<br/>Where every wight, save he, master or knave,<br/>Was with the lion frett, ere he astart?<br/>No wight but God, that he bare in his heart.<br/><br/>God list to shew his wonderful miracle<br/>In her, that we should see his mighty workes:<br/>Christ, which that is to every harm triacle,<br/>By certain meanes oft, as knowe clerkes,<br/>Doth thing for certain ende, that full derk is<br/>To manne's wit, that for our, ignorance<br/>Ne cannot know his prudent purveyance.<br/><br/>Now since she was not at the feast y-slaw,<br/>Who kepte her from drowning in the sea?<br/>Who kepte Jonas in the fish's maw,<br/>Till he was spouted up at Nineveh?<br/>Well may men know, it was no wight but he<br/>That kept the Hebrew people from drowning,<br/>With drye feet throughout the sea passing.<br/><br/>Who bade the foure spirits of tempest,<br/>That power have t' annoye land and sea,<br/>Both north and south, and also west and east,<br/>Annoye neither sea, nor land, nor tree?<br/>Soothly the commander of that was he<br/>That from the tempest aye this woman kept,<br/>As well when she awoke as when she slept.<br/><br/>Where might this woman meat and drinke have?<br/>Three year and more how lasted her vitaille?<br/>Who fed the Egyptian Mary in the cave<br/>Or in desert? no wight but Christ sans faille.<br/>Five thousand folk it was as great marvaille<br/>With loaves five and fishes two to feed<br/>God sent his foison at her greate need.<br/><br/>She drived forth into our ocean<br/>Throughout our wilde sea, till at the last<br/>Under an hold, that nempnen I not can,<br/>Far in Northumberland, the wave her cast<br/>And in the sand her ship sticked so fast<br/>That thennes would it not in all a tide:<br/>The will of Christ was that she should abide.<br/><br/>The Constable of the castle down did fare<br/>To see this wreck, and all the ship he sought,<br/>And found this weary woman full of care;<br/>He found also the treasure that she brought:<br/>In her language mercy she besought,<br/>The life out of her body for to twin,<br/>Her to deliver of woe that she was in.<br/><br/>A manner Latin corrupt  was her speech,<br/>But algate thereby was she understond.<br/>The Constable, when him list no longer seech,<br/>This woeful woman brought he to the lond.<br/>She kneeled down, and thanked Godde's sond;<br/>But what she was she would to no man say<br/>For foul nor fair, although that she should dey.<br/><br/>She said, she was so mazed in the sea,<br/>That she forgot her minde, by her truth.<br/>The Constable had of her so great pity<br/>And eke his wife, that they wept for ruth:<br/>She was so diligent withoute slouth<br/>To serve and please every one in that place,<br/>That all her lov'd, that looked in her face.<br/><br/>The Constable and Dame Hermegild his wife<br/>Were Pagans, and that country every where;<br/>But Hermegild lov'd Constance as her life;<br/>And Constance had so long sojourned there<br/>In orisons, with many a bitter tear,<br/>Till Jesus had converted through His grace<br/>Dame Hermegild, Constabless of that place.<br/><br/>In all that land no Christians durste rout;<br/>All Christian folk had fled from that country<br/>Through Pagans, that conquered all about<br/>The plages of the North by land and sea.<br/>To Wales had fled the Christianity<br/>Of olde Britons, dwelling in this isle;<br/>There was their refuge for the meanewhile.<br/><br/>But yet n'ere Christian Britons so exiled,<br/>That there n'ere some which in their privity<br/>Honoured Christ, and heathen folk beguiled;<br/>And nigh the castle such there dwelled three:<br/>And one of them was blind, and might not see,<br/>But it were with thilk eyen of his mind,<br/>With which men maye see when they be blind.<br/><br/>Bright was the sun, as in a summer's day,<br/>For which the Constable, and his wife also,<br/>And Constance, have y-take the righte way<br/>Toward the sea a furlong way or two,<br/>To playen, and to roame to and fro;<br/>And in their walk this blinde man they met,<br/>Crooked and old, with eyen fast y-shet.<br/><br/>"In the name of Christ," cried this blind Briton,<br/>"Dame Hermegild, give me my sight again!"<br/>This lady wax'd afrayed of that soun',<br/>Lest that her husband, shortly for to sayn,<br/>Would her for Jesus Christe's love have slain,<br/>Till Constance made her hold, and bade her wirch<br/>The will of Christ, as daughter of holy Church<br/><br/>The Constable wax'd abashed of that sight,<br/>And saide; "What amounteth all this fare?"<br/>Constance answered; "Sir, it is Christ's might,<br/>That helpeth folk out of the fiendes snare:"<br/>And so farforth she gan our law declare,<br/>That she the Constable, ere that it were eve,<br/>Converted, and on Christ made him believe.<br/><br/>This Constable was not lord of the place<br/>Of which I speak, there as he Constance fand,<br/>But kept it strongly many a winter space,<br/>Under Alla, king of Northumberland,<br/>That was full wise, and worthy of his hand<br/>Against the Scotes, as men may well hear;<br/>But turn I will again to my mattere.<br/><br/>Satan, that ever us waiteth to beguile,<br/>Saw of Constance all her perfectioun,<br/>And cast anon how he might quite her while;<br/>And made a young knight, that dwelt in that town,<br/>Love her so hot of foul affectioun,<br/>That verily him thought that he should spill<br/>But he of her might ones have his will.<br/><br/>He wooed her, but it availed nought;<br/>She woulde do no sinne by no way:<br/>And for despite, he compassed his thought<br/>To make her a shameful death to dey;<br/>He waiteth when the Constable is away,<br/>And privily upon a night he crept<br/>In Hermegilda's chamber while she slept.<br/><br/>Weary, forwaked in her orisons,<br/>Sleepeth Constance, and Hermegild also.<br/>This knight, through Satanas' temptation;<br/>All softetly is to the bed y-go,<br/>And cut the throat of Hermegild in two,<br/>And laid the bloody knife by Dame Constance,<br/>And went his way, there God give him mischance.<br/><br/>Soon after came the Constable home again,<br/>And eke Alla that king was of that land,<br/>And saw his wife dispiteously slain,<br/>For which full oft he wept and wrung his hand;<br/>And ill the bed the bloody knife he fand<br/>By Dame Constance: Alas! what might she say?<br/>For very woe her wit was all away.<br/><br/>To King Alla was told all this mischance<br/>And eke the time, and where, and in what wise<br/>That in a ship was founden this Constance,<br/>As here before ye have me heard devise:<br/>The kinges heart for pity gan agrise,<br/>When he saw so benign a creature<br/>Fall in disease and in misaventure.<br/><br/>For as the lamb toward his death is brought,<br/>So stood this innocent before the king:<br/>This false knight, that had this treason wrought,<br/>Bore her in hand that she had done this thing:<br/>But natheless there was great murmuring<br/>Among the people, that say they cannot guess<br/>That she had done so great a wickedness.<br/><br/>For they had seen her ever virtuous,<br/>And loving Hermegild right as her life:<br/>Of this bare witness each one in that house,<br/>Save he that Hermegild slew with his knife:<br/>This gentle king had caught a great motife<br/>Of this witness, and thought he would inquere<br/>Deeper into this case, the truth to lear.<br/><br/>Alas! Constance, thou has no champion,<br/>Nor fighte canst thou not, so well-away!<br/>But he that starf for our redemption,<br/>And bound Satan, and yet li'th where he lay,<br/>So be thy stronge champion this day:<br/>For, but Christ upon thee miracle kithe,<br/>Withoute guilt thou shalt be slain as swithe.<br/><br/>She set her down on knees, and thus she said;<br/>"Immortal God, that savedest Susanne<br/>From false blame;

lo thine end!<br/>Not only that thou faintest manne's mind,<br/>But verily thou wilt his body shend.<br/>Th' end of thy work, or of thy lustes blind,<br/>Is complaining: how many may men find,<br/>That not for work, sometimes, but for th' intent<br/>To do this sin, be either slain or shent?<br/><br/>How may this weake woman have the strength<br/>Her to defend against this renegate?<br/>O Goliath, unmeasurable of length,<br/>How mighte David make thee so mate?<br/>So young, and of armour so desolate,<br/>How durst he look upon thy dreadful face?<br/>Well may men see it was but Godde's grace.<br/><br/>Who gave Judith courage or hardiness<br/>To slay him, Holofernes, in his tent,<br/>And to deliver out of wretchedness<br/>The people of God? I say for this intent<br/>That right as God spirit of vigour sent<br/>To them, and saved them out of mischance,<br/>So sent he might and vigour to Constance.<br/><br/>Forth went her ship throughout the narrow mouth<br/>Of Jubaltare and Septe, driving alway,<br/>Sometime west, and sometime north and south,<br/>And sometime east, full many a weary day:<br/>Till Christe's mother (blessed be she aye)<br/>Had shaped through her endeless goodness<br/>To make an end of all her heaviness.<br/><br/>Now let us stint of Constance but a throw,<br/>And speak we of the Roman emperor,<br/>That out of Syria had by letters know<br/>The slaughter of Christian folk, and dishonor<br/>Done to his daughter by a false traitor,<br/>I mean the cursed wicked Soudaness,<br/>That at the feast let slay both more and less.<br/><br/>For which this emperor had sent anon<br/>His senator, with royal ordinance,<br/>And other lordes, God wot, many a one,<br/>On Syrians to take high vengeance:<br/>They burn and slay, and bring them to mischance<br/>Full many a day: but shortly this is th' end,<br/>Homeward to Rome they shaped them to wend.<br/><br/>This senator repaired with victory<br/>To Rome-ward, sailing full royally,<br/>And met the ship driving, as saith the story,<br/>In which Constance sat full piteously:<br/>And nothing knew he what she was, nor why<br/>She was in such array; nor she will say<br/>Of her estate, although that she should dey.<br/><br/>He brought her unto Rome, and to his wife<br/>He gave her, and her younge son also:<br/>And with the senator she led her life.<br/>Thus can our Lady bringen out of woe<br/>Woeful Constance, and many another mo':<br/>And longe time she dwelled in that place,<br/>In holy works ever, as was her grace.<br/><br/>The senatores wife her aunte was,<br/>But for all that she knew her ne'er the more:<br/>I will no longer tarry in this case,<br/>But to King Alla, whom I spake of yore,<br/>That for his wife wept and sighed sore,<br/>I will return, and leave I will Constance<br/>Under the senatores governance.<br/><br/>King Alla, which that had his mother slain,<br/>Upon a day fell in such repentance;<br/>That, if I shortly tell it shall and plain,<br/>To Rome he came to receive his penitance,<br/>And put him in the Pope's ordinance<br/>In high and low, and Jesus Christ besought<br/>Forgive his wicked works that he had wrought.<br/><br/>The fame anon throughout the town is borne,<br/>How Alla king shall come on pilgrimage,<br/>By harbingers that wente him beforn,<br/>For which the senator, as was usage,<br/>Rode him again, and many of his lineage,<br/>As well to show his high magnificence,<br/>As to do any king a reverence.<br/><br/>Great cheere did this noble senator<br/>To King Alla and he to him also;<br/>Each of them did the other great honor;<br/>And so befell, that in a day or two<br/>This senator did to King Alla go<br/>To feast, and shortly, if I shall not lie,<br/>Constance's son went in his company.<br/><br/>Some men would say, at request of Constance<br/>This senator had led this child to feast:<br/>I may not tellen every circumstance,<br/>Be as be may, there was he at the least:<br/>But sooth is this, that at his mother's hest<br/>Before Alla during the meates space,<br/>The child stood, looking in the kinges face.<br/><br/>This Alla king had of this child great wonder,<br/>And to the senator he said anon,<br/>"Whose is that faire child that standeth yonder?"<br/>"I n'ot," quoth he, "by God and by Saint John;<br/>A mother he hath, but father hath he none,<br/>That I of wot:" and shortly in a stound<br/>He told to Alla how this child was found.<br/><br/>"But God wot," quoth this senator also,<br/>"So virtuous a liver in all my life<br/>I never saw, as she, nor heard of mo'<br/>Of worldly woman, maiden, widow or wife:<br/>I dare well say she hadde lever a knife<br/>Throughout her breast, than be a woman wick',<br/>There is no man could bring her to that prick.<br/><br/>Now was this child as like unto Constance<br/>As possible is a creature to be:<br/>This Alla had the face in remembrance<br/>Of Dame Constance, and thereon mused he,<br/>If that the childe's mother were aught she<br/>That was his wife; and privily he sight,<br/>And sped him from the table that he might.<br/><br/>"Parfay," thought he, "phantom is in mine head.<br/>I ought to deem, of skilful judgement,<br/>That in the salte sea my wife is dead."<br/>And afterward he made his argument,<br/>"What wot I, if that Christ have hither sent<br/>My wife by sea, as well as he her sent<br/>To my country, from thennes that she went?"<br/><br/>And, after noon, home with the senator.<br/>Went Alla, for to see this wondrous chance.<br/>This senator did Alla great honor,<br/>And hastily he sent after Constance:<br/>But truste well, her liste not to dance.<br/>When that she wiste wherefore was that sond,<br/>Unneth upon her feet she mighte stand.<br/><br/>When Alla saw his wife, fair he her gret,<br/>And wept, that it was ruthe for to see,<br/>For at the firste look he on her set<br/>He knew well verily that it was she:<br/>And she, for sorrow, as dumb stood as a tree:<br/>So was her hearte shut in her distress,<br/>When she remember'd his unkindeness.<br/><br/>Twice she swooned in his owen sight,<br/>He wept and him excused piteously:<br/>"Now God," quoth he, "and all his hallows bright<br/>So wisly on my soule have mercy,<br/>That of your harm as guilteless am I,<br/>As is Maurice my son, so like your face,<br/>Else may the fiend me fetch out of this place."<br/><br/>Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain,<br/>Ere that their woeful heartes mighte cease;<br/>Great was the pity for to hear them plain,<br/>Through whiche plaintes gan their woe increase.<br/>I pray you all my labour to release,<br/>I may not tell all their woe till to-morrow,<br/>I am so weary for to speak of sorrow.<br/><br/>But finally, when that the sooth is wist,<br/>That Alla guiltless was of all her woe,<br/>I trow an hundred times have they kiss'd,<br/>And such a bliss is there betwixt them two,<br/>That, save the joy that lasteth evermo',<br/>There is none like, that any creature<br/>Hath seen, or shall see, while the world may dure.<br/><br/>Then prayed she her husband meekely<br/>In the relief of her long piteous pine,<br/>That he would pray her father specially,<br/>That of his majesty he would incline<br/>To vouchesafe some day with him to dine:<br/>She pray'd him eke, that he should by no way<br/>Unto her father no word of her say.<br/><br/>Some men would say, how that the child Maurice<br/>Did this message unto the emperor:<br/>But, as I guess, Alla was not so nice,<br/>To him that is so sovereign of honor<br/>As he that is of Christian folk the flow'r,<br/>Send any child, but better 'tis to deem<br/>He went himself; and so it may well seem.<br/><br/>This emperor hath granted gentilly<br/>To come to dinner, as he him besought:<br/>And well rede I, he looked busily<br/>Upon this child, and on his daughter thought.<br/>Alla went to his inn, and as him ought<br/>Arrayed for this feast in every wise,<br/>As farforth as his cunning may suffice.<br/><br/>The morrow came, and Alla gan him dress,<br/>And eke his wife, the emperor to meet:<br/>And forth they rode in joy and in gladness,<br/>And when she saw her father in the street,<br/>She lighted down and fell before his feet.<br/>"Father," quoth she, "your younge child Constance<br/>Is now full clean out of your remembrance.<br/><br/>"I am your daughter, your Constance," quoth she,<br/>"That whilom ye have sent into Syrie;<br/>It am I, father, that in the salt sea<br/>Was put alone, and damned for to die.<br/>Now, goode father, I you mercy cry,<br/>Send me no more into none heatheness,<br/>But thank my lord here of his kindeness."<br/><br/>Who can the piteous joye tellen all,<br/>Betwixt them three, since they be thus y-met?<br/>But of my tale make an end I shall,<br/>The day goes fast, I will no longer let.<br/>These gladde folk to dinner be y-set;<br/>In joy and bliss at meat I let them dwell,<br/>A thousand fold well more than I can tell.<br/><br/>This child Maurice was since then emperor<br/>Made by the Pope, and lived Christianly,<br/>To Christe's Churche did he great honor:<br/>But I let all his story passe by,<br/>Of Constance is my tale especially,<br/>In the olde Roman gestes men may find<br/>Maurice's life, I bear it not in mind.<br/><br/>This King Alla, when he his time sey,<br/>With his Constance, his holy wife so sweet,<br/>To England are they come the righte way,<br/>Where they did live in joy and in quiet.<br/>But little while it lasted, I you hete,<br/>Joy of this world for time will not abide,<br/>From day to night it changeth as the tide.<br/><br/>Who liv'd ever in such delight one day,<br/>That him not moved either conscience,<br/>Or ire, or talent, or some kind affray,<br/>Envy, or pride, or passion, or offence?<br/>I say but for this ende this sentence,<br/>That little while in joy or in pleasance<br/>Lasted the bliss of Alla with Constance.<br/><br/>For death, that takes of high and low his rent,<br/>When passed was a year, even as I guess,<br/>Out of this world this King Alla he hent,<br/>For whom Constance had full great heaviness.<br/>Now let us pray that God his soule bless:<br/>And Dame Constance, finally to say,<br/>Toward the town of Rome went her way.<br/><br/>To Rome is come this holy creature,<br/>And findeth there her friendes whole and sound:<br/>Now is she scaped all her aventure:<br/>And when that she her father hath y-found,<br/>Down on her knees falleth she to ground,<br/>Weeping for tenderness in hearte blithe<br/>She herieth God an hundred thousand sithe.<br/><br/>In virtue and in holy almes-deed<br/>They liven all, and ne'er asunder wend;<br/>Till death departeth them, this life they lead:<br/>And fare now well, my tale is at an end<br/>Now Jesus Christ, that of his might may send<br/>Joy after woe, govern us in his grace<br/>And keep us alle that be in this place.
