# üíÆ The Blind Girl by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    Kind Christians, pray list to me,<br/>And I'll relate a sad story,<br/>Concerning a little blind girl, only nine years of age,<br/>Who lived with her father in a lonely cottage.<br/><br/>Poor girl, she had never seen the blessed light of day,<br/>Nor the beautiful fields of corn and hay,<br/>Nor the sparrows, that lifted their heads at early morn<br/>To bright Sol that does the hills adorn.<br/><br/>And near the cottage door there was an elm tree;<br/>But that stunted elm tree she never did see,<br/>Yet her little heart sometimes felt gay<br/>As she listened to the thrushes that warbled the live-long day.<br/><br/>And she would talk to the wren when alone,<br/>And to the wren she would her loneliness bemoan,<br/>And say, "Dear little wren, come again to-morrow;<br/>Now be sure and come, your singing will chase away my sorrow."<br/><br/>She was motherless, but she had a drunken father,<br/>Who in his savage moods drank all he could gather,<br/>And would often cruelly beat her until she would cry,<br/>"Dear father, if you beat me I will surely die."<br/><br/>She spent the days in getting ready her father's food,<br/>Which was truly for her drunken father's good;<br/>But one night he came home, reeling drunk,<br/>And the poor child's heart with fear sunk;<br/><br/>And he cried, "You were at the door when I came up the lane;<br/>Take that, you good-for-nothing slut; you're to blame<br/>For not having my supper ready; you will find<br/>That's no excuse, Sarah, because you are blind."<br/><br/>And with a stick he struck her as he spoke<br/>Across the shoulders, until the stick almost broke;<br/>Crying aloud, "I'll teach you better, you little sneak;"<br/>And with the beating, Sarah's heart was like to break.<br/><br/>Poor little Sarah had never seen the snow;<br/>She knew it was beautiful white, some children told her so;<br/>And in December, when the snow began to fall,<br/>She would go to the door and make a snowball.<br/><br/>One day she'd been very cheerless and alone,<br/>Poor child, and so cold, almost chilled to the bone;<br/>For her father had spent his wages in drink,<br/>And for want of fire she was almost at death's brink.<br/><br/>Her face was pinched with hunger but she never complained,<br/>And her little feet with cold were chilblained,<br/>And her father that day had not come home for dinner,<br/>And the dull grey sky was all of a shimmer.<br/><br/>So poor Sarah was very sick when her father came home;<br/>So bad, little dear, that she did sigh and moan,<br/>And when her father saw her in bed<br/>He was heart-stricken with fear and dread.<br/><br/>So within a few days poor Sarah did die,<br/>And for the loss of Sarah the drunken father did cry,<br/>So the loss of his child soon converted him<br/>From drinking either whiskey, rum or gin.
