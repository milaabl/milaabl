  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To the Lord Chancellor by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Thy country's curse is on thee, darkest crest<br/>Of that foul, knotted, many-headed worm<br/>Which rends our Mother's bosom--Priestly Pest!<br/>Masked Resurrection of a buried Form!<br/><br/>Thy country's curse is on thee! Justice sold,<br/>Truth trampled, Nature's landmarks overthrown,<br/>And heaps of fraud-accumulated gold,<br/>Plead, loud as thunder, at Destruction's throne.<br/><br/>And whilst that sure slow Angel which aye stands<br/>Watching the beck of Mutability<br/>Delays to execute her high commands,<br/>And, though a nation weeps, spares thine and thee,<br/><br/>Oh, let a father's curse be on thy soul,<br/>And let a daughter's hope be on thy tomb;<br/>Be both, on thy gray head, a leaden cowl<br/>To weigh thee down to thine approaching doom.<br/><br/>I curse thee by a parent's outraged love,<br/>By hopes long cherished and too lately lost,<br/>By gentle feelings thou couldst never prove,<br/>By griefs which thy stern nature never crossed;<br/><br/>By those infantine smiles of happy light,<br/>Which were a fire within a stranger's hearth,<br/>Quenched even when kindled, in untimely night<br/>Hiding the promise of a lovely birth:<br/><br/>By those unpractised accents of young speech,<br/>Which he who is a father thought to frame<br/>To gentlest lore, such as the wisest teach--<br/>THOU strike the lyre of mind!--oh, grief and shame!<br/><br/>By all the happy see in children's growth--<br/>That undeveloped flower of budding years--<br/>Sweetness and sadness interwoven both,<br/>Source of the sweetest hopes and saddest fears-<br/><br/>By all the days, under an hireling's care,<br/>Of dull constraint and bitter heaviness,--<br/>O wretched ye if ever any were,--<br/>Sadder than orphans, yet not fatherless!<br/><br/>By the false cant which on their innocent lips<br/>Must hang like poison on an opening bloom,<br/>By the dark creeds which cover with eclipse<br/>Their pathway from the cradle to the tomb--<br/><br/>By thy most impious Hell, and all its terror;<br/>By all the grief, the madness, and the guilt<br/>Of thine impostures, which must be their error--<br/>That sand on which thy crumbling power is built--<br/><br/>By thy complicity with lust and hate--<br/>Thy thirst for tears--thy hunger after gold--<br/>The ready frauds which ever on thee wait--<br/>The servile arts in which thou hast grown old--<br/><br/>By thy most killing sneer, and by thy smile--<br/>By all the arts and snares of thy black den,<br/>And--for thou canst outweep the crocodile--<br/>By thy false tears--those millstones braining men--<br/><br/>By all the hate which checks a father's love--<br/>By all the scorn which kills a father's care--<br/>By those most impious hands which dared remove<br/>Nature's high bounds--by thee--and by despair--<br/><br/>Yes, the despair which bids a father groan,<br/>And cry, 'My children are no longer mine--<br/>The blood within those veins may be mine own,<br/>But--Tyrant--their polluted souls are thine;--<br/><br/>I curse thee--though I hate thee not.--O slave!<br/>If thou couldst quench the earth-consuming Hell<br/>Of which thou art a daemon, on thy grave<br/>This curse should be a blessing. Fare thee well!
</p>
