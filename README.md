# üíÆ Ballade De Marguerite (Normande) by *Oscar Wilde*

<p>
    I am weary of lying within the chase<br/>When the knights are meeting in market-place.<br/><br/>Nay, go not thou to the red-roofed town<br/>Lest the hoofs of the war-horse tread thee down.<br/><br/>But I would not go where the Squires ride,<br/>I would only walk by my Lady's side.<br/><br/>Alack! and alack! thou art overbold,<br/>A Forester's son may not eat off gold.<br/><br/>Will she love me the less that my Father is seen<br/>Each Martinmas day in a doublet green?<br/><br/>Perchance she is sewing at tapestrie,<br/>Spindle and loom are not meet for thee.<br/><br/>Ah, if she is working the arras bright<br/>I might ravel the threads by the fire-light.<br/><br/>Perchance she is hunting of the deer,<br/>How could you follow o'er hill and mere?<br/><br/>Ah, if she is riding with the court,<br/>I might run beside her and wind the morte.<br/><br/>Perchance she is kneeling in St. Denys,<br/>(On her soul may our Lady have gramercy!)<br/><br/>Ah, if she is praying in lone chapelle,<br/>I might swing the censer and ring the bell.<br/><br/>Come in, my son, for you look sae pale,<br/>The father shall fill thee a stoup of ale.<br/><br/>But who are these knights in bright array?<br/>Is it a pageant the rich folks play?<br/><br/>'T is the King of England from over sea,<br/>Who has come unto visit our fair countrie.<br/><br/>But why does the curfew toll sae low?<br/>And why do the mourners walk a-row?<br/><br/>O 't is Hugh of Amiens my sister's son<br/>Who is lying stark, for his day is done.<br/><br/>Nay, nay, for I see white lilies clear,<br/>It is no strong man who lies on the bier.<br/><br/>O 't is old Dame Jeannette that kept the hall,<br/>I knew she would die at the autumn fall.<br/><br/>Dame Jeannette had not that gold-brown hair,<br/>Old Jeannette was not a maiden fair.<br/><br/>O 't is none of our kith and none of our kin,<br/>(Her soul may our Lady assoil from sin!)<br/><br/>But I hear the boy's voice chaunting sweet,<br/>'Elle est morte, la Marguerite.'<br/><br/>Come in, my son, and lie on the bed,<br/>And let the dead folk bury their dead.<br/><br/>O mother, you know I loved her true:<br/>O mother, hath one grave room for two?
