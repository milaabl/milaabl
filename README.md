# üíÆ Hymn To Death by *William Cullen Bryant*

<p>
    Oh! could I hope the wise and pure in heart<br/>Might hear my song without a frown, nor deem<br/>My voice unworthy of the theme it tries,--<br/>I would take up the hymn to Death, and say<br/>To the grim power, The world hath slandered thee<br/>And mocked thee. On thy dim and shadowy brow<br/>They place an iron crown, and call thee king<br/>Of terrors, and the spoiler of the world,<br/>Deadly assassin, that strik'st down the fair,<br/>The loved, the good--that breath'st upon the lights<br/>Of virtue set along the vale of life,<br/>And they go out in darkness. I am come,<br/>Not with reproaches, not with cries and prayers,<br/>Such as have stormed thy stern insensible ear<br/>From the beginning. I am come to speak<br/>Thy praises. True it is, that I have wept<br/>Thy conquests, and may weep them yet again:<br/>And thou from some I love wilt take a life<br/>Dear to me as my own. Yet while the spell<br/>Is on my spirit, and I talk with thee<br/>In sight of all thy trophies, face to face,<br/>Meet is it that my voice should utter forth<br/><br/>Thy nobler triumphs: I will teach the world<br/>To thank thee.--Who are thine accusers?--Who?<br/>The living!--they who never felt thy power,<br/>And know thee not. The curses of the wretch<br/>Whose crimes are ripe, his sufferings when thy hand<br/>Is on him, and the hour he dreads is come,<br/>Are writ among thy praises. But the good--<br/>Does he whom thy kind hand dismissed to peace,<br/>Upbraid the gentle violence that took off<br/>His fetters, and unbarred his prison cell?<br/>Raise then the Hymn to Death. Deliverer!<br/>God hath anointed thee to free the oppressed<br/>And crush the oppressor. When the armed chief,<br/>The conqueror of nations, walks the world,<br/>And it is changed beneath his feet, and all<br/>Its kingdoms melt into one mighty realm--<br/>Thou, while his head is loftiest, and his heart<br/>Blasphemes, imagining his own right hand<br/>Almighty, sett'st upon him thy stern grasp,<br/>And the strong links of that tremendous chain<br/>That bound mankind are crumbled; thou dost break<br/>Sceptre and crown, and beat his throne to dust.<br/>Then the earth shouts with gladness, and her tribes<br/>Gather within their ancient bounds again.<br/>Else had the mighty of the olden time,<br/>Nimrod, Sesostris, or the youth who feigned<br/>His birth from Lybian Ammon, smote even now<br/>The nations with a rod of iron, and driven<br/>Their chariot o'er our necks. Thou dost avenge,<br/>In thy good time, the wrongs of those who know<br/><br/>No other friend. Nor dost thou interpose<br/>Only to lay the sufferer asleep,<br/>Where he who made him wretched troubles not<br/>His rest--thou dost strike down his tyrant too.<br/>Oh, there is joy when hands that held the scourge<br/>Drop lifeless, and the pitiless heart is cold.<br/>Thou too dost purge from earth its horrible<br/>And old idolatries; from the proud fanes<br/>Each to his grave their priests go out, till none<br/>Is left to teach their worship; then the fires<br/>Of sacrifice are chilled, and the green moss<br/>O'ercreeps their altars; the fallen images<br/>Cumber the weedy courts, and for loud hymns,<br/>Chanted by kneeling crowds, the chiding winds<br/>Shriek in the solitary aisles. When he<br/>Who gives his life to guilt, and laughs at all<br/>The laws that God or man has made, and round<br/>Hedges his seat with power, and shines in wealth,--<br/>Lifts up his atheist front to scoff at Heaven,<br/>And celebrates his shame in open day,<br/>Thou, in the pride of all his crimes, cutt'st off<br/>The horrible example. Touched by thine,<br/>The extortioner's hard hand foregoes the gold<br/>Wrong from the o'er-worn poor. The perjurer,<br/>Whose tongue was lithe, e'en now, and voluble<br/>Against his neighbour's life, and he who laughed<br/>And leaped for joy to see a spotless fame<br/>Blasted before his own foul calumnies,<br/>Are smit with deadly silence. He, who sold<br/>His conscience to preserve a worthless life,<br/><br/>Even while he hugs himself on his escape,<br/>Trembles, as, doubly terrible, at length,<br/>Thy steps o'ertake him, and there is no time<br/>For parley--nor will bribes unclench thy grasp.<br/>Oft, too, dost thou reform thy victim, long<br/>Ere his last hour. And when the reveller,<br/>Mad in the chase of pleasure, stretches on,<br/>And strains each nerve, and clears the path of life<br/>Like wind, thou point'st him to the dreadful goal,<br/>And shak'st thy hour-glass in his reeling eye,<br/>And check'st him in mid course. Thy skeleton hand<br/>Shows to the faint of spirit the right path,<br/>And he is warned, and fears to step aside.<br/>Thou sett'st between the ruffian and his crime<br/>Thy ghastly countenance, and his slack hand<br/>Drops the drawn knife. But, oh, most fearfully<br/>Dost thou show forth Heaven's justice, when thy shafts<br/>Drink up the ebbing spirit--then the hard<br/>Of heart and violent of hand restores<br/>The treasure to the friendless wretch he wronged.<br/>Then from the writhing bosom thou dost pluck<br/>The guilty secret; lips, for ages sealed,<br/>Are faithless to the dreadful trust at length,<br/>And give it up; the felon's latest breath<br/>Absolves the innocent man who bears his crime;<br/>The slanderer, horror smitten, and in tears,<br/>Recalls the deadly obloquy he forged<br/>To work his brother's ruin. Thou dost make<br/>Thy penitent victim utter to the air<br/>The dark conspiracy that strikes at life,<br/><br/>And aims to whelm the laws; ere yet the hour<br/>Is come, and the dread sign of murder given.<br/>Thus, from the first of time, hast thou been found<br/>On virtue's side; the wicked, but for thee,<br/>Had been too strong for the good; the great of earth<br/>Had crushed the weak for ever. Schooled in guile<br/>For ages, while each passing year had brought<br/>Its baneful lesson, they had filled the world<br/>With their abominations; while its tribes,<br/>Trodden to earth, imbruted, and despoiled,<br/>Had knelt to them in worship; sacrifice<br/>Had smoked on many an altar, temple roofs<br/>Had echoed with the blasphemous prayer and hymn:<br/>But thou, the great reformer of the world,<br/>Tak'st off the sons of violence and fraud<br/>In their green pupilage, their lore half learned--<br/>Ere guilt has quite o'errun the simple heart<br/>God gave them at their birth, and blotted out<br/>His image. Thou dost mark them, flushed with hope,<br/>As on the threshold of their vast designs<br/>Doubtful and loose they stand, and strik'st them down.<br/><br/>Alas, I little thought that the stern power<br/>Whose fearful praise I sung, would try me thus<br/>Before the strain was ended. It must cease--<br/>For he is in his grave who taught my youth<br/>The art of verse, and in the bud of life<br/>Offered me to the muses. Oh, cut off<br/>Untimely! when thy reason in its strength,<br/>Ripened by years of toil and studious search<br/><br/>And watch of Nature's silent lessons, taught<br/>Thy hand to practise best the lenient art<br/>To which thou gavest thy laborious days.<br/>And, last, thy life. And, therefore, when the earth<br/>Received thee, tears were in unyielding eyes<br/>And on hard cheeks, and they who deemed thy skill<br/>Delayed their death-hour, shuddered and turned pale<br/>When thou wert gone. This faltering verse, which thou<br/>Shalt not, as wont, o'erlook, is all I have<br/>To offer at thy grave--this--and the hope<br/>To copy thy example, and to leave<br/>A name of which the wretched shall not think<br/>As of an enemy's, whom they forgive<br/>As all forgive the dead. Rest, therefore, thou<br/>Whose early guidance trained my infant steps--<br/>Rest, in the bosom of God, till the brief sleep<br/>Of death is over, and a happier life<br/>Shall dawn to waken thine insensible dust.<br/>Now thou art not--and yet the men whose guilt<br/>Has wearied Heaven for vengeance--he who bears<br/>False witness--he who takes the orphan's bread,<br/>And robs the widow--he who spreads abroad<br/>Polluted hands in mockery of prayer,<br/>Are left to cumber earth. Shuddering I look<br/>On what is written, yet I blot not out<br/>The desultory numbers--let them stand.<br/>The record of an idle revery.
