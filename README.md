# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Franklin's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>"IN faith, Squier, thou hast thee well acquit,<br/>And gentilly; I praise well thy wit,"<br/>Quoth the Franklin; "considering thy youthe<br/>So feelingly thou speak'st, Sir, I aloue thee,<br/>As to my doom, there is none that is here<br/>Of eloquence that shall be thy peer,<br/>If that thou live; God give thee goode chance,<br/>And in virtue send thee continuance,<br/>For of thy speaking I have great dainty.<br/>I have a son, and, by the Trinity;<br/>It were me lever than twenty pound worth land,<br/>Though it right now were fallen in my hand,<br/>He were a man of such discretion<br/>As that ye be: fy on possession,<br/>But if a man be virtuous withal.<br/>I have my sone snibbed and yet shall,<br/>For he to virtue listeth not t'intend,<br/>But for to play at dice, and to dispend,<br/>And lose all that he hath, is his usage;<br/>And he had lever talke with a page,<br/>Than to commune with any gentle wight,<br/>There he might learen gentilless aright."<br/><br/>Straw for your gentillesse!" quoth our Host.<br/>"What? Frankelin, pardie, Sir, well thou wost<br/>That each of you must tellen at the least<br/>A tale or two, or breake his behest."<br/>"That know I well, Sir," quoth the Frankelin;<br/>"I pray you have me not in disdain,<br/>Though I to this man speak a word or two."<br/>"Tell on thy tale, withoute wordes mo'."<br/>"Gladly, Sir Host," quoth he, "I will obey<br/>Unto your will; now hearken what I say;<br/>I will you not contrary in no wise,<br/>As far as that my wittes may suffice.<br/>I pray to God that it may please you,<br/>Then wot I well that it is good enow.<br/><br/>"These olde gentle Bretons, in their days,<br/>Of divers aventures made lays,<br/>Rhymeden in their firste Breton tongue;<br/>Which layes with their instruments they sung,<br/>Or elles reade them for their pleasance;<br/>And one of them have I in remembrance,<br/>Which I shall say with good will as I can.<br/>But, Sirs, because I am a borel man,<br/>At my beginning first I you beseech<br/>Have me excused of my rude speech.<br/>I learned never rhetoric, certain;<br/>Thing that I speak, it must be bare and plain.<br/>I slept never on the mount of Parnasso,<br/>Nor learned Marcus Tullius Cicero.<br/>Coloures know I none, withoute dread,<br/>But such colours as growen in the mead,<br/>Or elles such as men dye with or paint;<br/>Colours of rhetoric be to me quaint;<br/>My spirit feeleth not of such mattere.<br/>But, if you list, my tale shall ye hear."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>In Armoric', that called is Bretagne,<br/>There was a knight, that lov'd and did his pain<br/>To serve a lady in his beste wise;<br/>And many a labour, many a great emprise,<br/>He for his lady wrought, ere she were won:<br/>For she was one the fairest under sun,<br/>And eke thereto come of so high kindred,<br/>That well unnethes durst this knight for dread,<br/>Tell her his woe, his pain, and his distress<br/>But, at the last, she for his worthiness,<br/>And namely for his meek obeisance,<br/>Hath such a pity caught of his penance,<br/>That privily she fell of his accord<br/>To take him for her husband and her lord<br/>(Of such lordship as men have o'er their wives);<br/>And, for to lead the more in bliss their lives,<br/>Of his free will he swore her as a knight,<br/>That never in all his life he day nor night<br/>Should take upon himself no mastery<br/>Against her will, nor kithe her jealousy,<br/>But her obey, and follow her will in all,<br/>As any lover to his lady shall;<br/>Save that the name of sovereignety<br/>That would he have, for shame of his degree.<br/>She thanked him, and with full great humbless<br/>She saide; "Sir, since of your gentleness<br/>Ye proffer me to have so large a reign,<br/>Ne woulde God never betwixt us twain,<br/>As in my guilt, were either war or strife:<br/>Sir, I will be your humble true wife,<br/>Have here my troth, till that my hearte brest."<br/>Thus be they both in quiet and in rest.<br/><br/>For one thing, Sires, safely dare I say,<br/>That friends ever each other must obey,<br/>If they will longe hold in company.<br/>Love will not be constrain'd by mastery.<br/>When mast'ry comes, the god of love anon<br/>Beateth  his wings, and, farewell, he is gone.<br/>Love is a thing as any spirit free.<br/>Women of kind desire liberty,<br/>And not to be constrained as a thrall,<br/>And so do men, if soothly I say shall.<br/>Look who that is most patient in love,<br/>He is at his advantage all above.<br/>Patience is a high virtue certain,<br/>For it vanquisheth, as these clerkes sayn,<br/>Thinges that rigour never should attain.<br/>For every word men may not chide or plain.<br/>Learne to suffer, or, so may I go,<br/>Ye shall it learn whether ye will or no.<br/>For in this world certain no wight there is,<br/>That he not doth or saith sometimes amiss.<br/>Ire, or sickness, or constellation,<br/>Wine, woe, or changing of complexion,<br/>Causeth full oft to do amiss or speaken:<br/>On every wrong a man may not be wreaken.<br/>After the time must be temperance<br/>To every wight that can of governance.<br/>And therefore hath this worthy wise knight<br/>(To live in ease) sufferance her behight;<br/>And she to him full wisly gan to swear<br/>That never should there be default in her.<br/>Here may men see a humble wife accord;<br/>Thus hath she ta'en her servant and her lord,<br/>Servant in love, and lord in marriage.<br/>Then was he both in lordship and servage?<br/>Servage? nay, but in lordship all above,<br/>Since he had both his lady and his love:<br/>His lady certes, and his wife also,<br/>The which that law of love accordeth to.<br/>And when he was in this prosperrity,<br/>Home with his wife he went to his country,<br/>Not far from Penmark, where his dwelling was,<br/>And there he liv'd in bliss and in solace.<br/>Who coulde tell, but he had wedded be,<br/>The joy, the ease, and the prosperity,<br/>That is betwixt a husband and his wife?<br/>A year and more lasted this blissful life,<br/>Till that this knight, of whom I spake thus,<br/>That of Cairrud  was call'd Arviragus,<br/>Shope him to go and dwell a year or twain<br/>In Engleland, that call'd was eke Britain,<br/>To seek in armes worship and honour<br/>(For all his lust he set in such labour);<br/>And dwelled there two years; the book saith thus.<br/><br/>Now will I stint of this Arviragus,<br/>And speak I will of Dorigen his wife,<br/>That lov'd her husband as her hearte's life.<br/>For his absence weepeth she and siketh,<br/>As do these noble wives when them liketh;<br/>She mourneth, waketh, waileth, fasteth, plaineth;<br/>Desire of his presence her so distraineth,<br/>That all this wide world she set at nought.<br/>Her friendes, which that knew her heavy thought,<br/>Comforte her in all that ever they may;<br/>They preache her, they tell her night and day,<br/>That causeless she slays herself, alas!<br/>And every comfort possible in this case<br/>They do to her, with all their business,<br/>And all to make her leave her heaviness.<br/>By process, as ye knowen every one,<br/>Men may so longe graven in a stone,<br/>Till some figure therein imprinted be:<br/>So long have they comforted her, till she<br/>Received hath, by hope and by reason,<br/>Th' imprinting of their consolation,<br/>Through which her greate sorrow gan assuage;<br/>She may not always duren in such rage.<br/>And eke Arviragus, in all this care,<br/>Hath sent his letters home of his welfare,<br/>And that he will come hastily again,<br/>Or elles had this sorrow her hearty-slain.<br/>Her friendes saw her sorrow gin to slake,<br/>And prayed her on knees for Godde's sake<br/>To come and roamen in their company,<br/>Away to drive her darke fantasy;<br/>And finally she granted that request,<br/>For well she saw that it was for the best.<br/><br/>Now stood her castle faste by the sea,<br/>And often with her friendes walked she,<br/>Her to disport upon the bank on high,<br/>There as many a ship and barge sigh,<br/>Sailing their courses, where them list to go.<br/>But then was that a parcel of her woe,<br/>For to herself full oft, "Alas!" said she,<br/>Is there no ship, of so many as I see,<br/>Will bringe home my lord? then were my heart<br/>All warish'd of this bitter paine's smart."<br/>Another time would she sit and think,<br/>And cast her eyen downward from the brink;<br/>But when she saw the grisly rockes blake,<br/>For very fear so would her hearte quake,<br/>That on her feet she might her not sustene<br/>Then would she sit adown upon the green,<br/>And piteously into the sea behold,<br/>And say right thus, with careful sikes cold:<br/>"Eternal God! that through thy purveyance<br/>Leadest this world by certain governance,<br/>In idle, as men say, ye nothing make;<br/>But, Lord, these grisly fiendly rockes blake,<br/>That seem rather a foul confusion<br/>Of work, than any fair creation<br/>Of such a perfect wise God and stable,<br/>Why have ye wrought this work unreasonable?<br/>For by this work, north, south, or west, or east,<br/>There is not foster'd man, nor bird, nor beast:<br/>It doth no good, to my wit, but annoyeth.<br/>See ye not, Lord, how mankind it destroyeth?<br/>A hundred thousand bodies of mankind<br/>Have rockes slain, all be they not in mind;<br/>Which mankind is so fair part of thy work,<br/>Thou madest it like to thine owen mark.<br/>Then seemed it ye had a great cherte<br/>Toward mankind; but how then may it be<br/>That ye such meanes make it to destroy?<br/>Which meanes do no good, but ever annoy.<br/>I wot well, clerkes will say as them lest,<br/>By arguments, that all is for the best,<br/>Although I can the causes not y-know;<br/>But thilke God that made the wind to blow,<br/>As keep my lord, this is my conclusion:<br/>To clerks leave I all disputation:<br/>But would to God that all these rockes blake<br/>Were sunken into helle for his sake<br/>These rockes slay mine hearte for the fear."<br/>Thus would she say, with many a piteous tear.<br/><br/>Her friendes saw that it was no disport<br/>To roame by the sea, but discomfort,<br/>And shope them for to playe somewhere else.<br/>They leade her by rivers and by wells,<br/>And eke in other places delectables;<br/>They dancen, and they play at chess and tables.<br/>So on a day, right in the morning-tide,<br/>Unto a garden that was there beside,<br/>In which that they had made their ordinance<br/>Of victual, and of other purveyance,<br/>They go and play them all the longe day:<br/>And this was on the sixth morrow of May,<br/>Which May had painted with his softe showers<br/>This garden full of leaves and of flowers:<br/>And craft of manne's hand so curiously<br/>Arrayed had this garden truely,<br/>That never was there garden of such price,<br/>But if it were the very Paradise.<br/>Th'odour of flowers, and the freshe sight,<br/>Would have maked any hearte light<br/>That e'er was born, but if too great sickness<br/>Or too great sorrow held it in distress;<br/>So full it was of beauty and pleasance.<br/>And after dinner they began to dance<br/>And sing also, save Dorigen alone<br/>Who made alway her complaint and her moan,<br/>For she saw not him on the dance go<br/>That was her husband, and her love also;<br/>But natheless she must a time abide<br/>And with good hope let her sorrow slide.<br/><br/>Upon this dance, amonge other men,<br/>Danced a squier before Dorigen<br/>That fresher was, and jollier of array<br/>As to my doom, than is the month of May.<br/>He sang and danced, passing any man,<br/>That is or was since that the world began;<br/>Therewith he was, if men should him descrive,<br/>One of the beste faring men alive,<br/>Young, strong, and virtuous, and rich, and wise,<br/>And well beloved, and holden in great price.<br/>And, shortly if the sooth I telle shall,<br/>Unweeting of this Dorigen at all,<br/>This lusty squier, servant to Venus,<br/>Which that y-called was Aurelius,<br/>Had lov'd her best of any creature<br/>Two year and more, as was his aventure;<br/>But never durst he tell her his grievance;<br/>Withoute cup he drank all his penance.<br/>He was despaired, nothing durst he say,<br/>Save in his songes somewhat would he wray<br/>His woe, as in a general complaining;<br/>He said, he lov'd, and was belov'd nothing.<br/>Of suche matter made he many lays,<br/>Songes, complaintes, roundels, virelays<br/>How that he durste not his sorrow tell,<br/>But languished, as doth a Fury in hell;<br/>And die he must, he said, as did Echo<br/>For Narcissus, that durst not tell her woe.<br/>In other manner than ye hear me say,<br/>He durste not to her his woe bewray,<br/>Save that paraventure sometimes at dances,<br/>Where younge folke keep their observances,<br/>It may well be he looked on her face<br/>In such a wise, as man that asketh grace,<br/>But nothing wiste she of his intent.<br/>Nath'less it happen'd, ere they thennes went,<br/>Because that he was her neighebour,<br/>And was a man of worship and honour,<br/>And she had knowen him of time yore,<br/>They fell in speech, and forth aye more and more<br/>Unto his purpose drew Aurelius;<br/>And when he saw his time, he saide thus:<br/>Madam," quoth he, "by God that this world made,<br/>So that I wist it might your hearte glade,<br/>I would, that day that your Arviragus<br/>Went over sea, that I, Aurelius,<br/>Had gone where I should never come again;<br/>For well I wot my service is in vain.<br/>My guerdon is but bursting of mine heart.<br/>Madame, rue upon my paine's smart,<br/>For with a word ye may me slay or save.<br/>Here at your feet God would that I were grave.<br/>I have now no leisure more to say:<br/>Have mercy, sweet, or you will do me dey."<br/><br/>She gan to look upon Aurelius;<br/>"Is this your will," quoth she, "and say ye thus?<br/>Ne'er erst," quoth she, "I wiste what ye meant:<br/>But now, Aurelius, I know your intent.<br/>By thilke God that gave me soul and life,<br/>Never shall I be an untrue wife<br/>In word nor work, as far as I have wit;<br/>I will be his to whom that I am knit;<br/>Take this for final answer as of me."<br/>But after that in play thus saide she.<br/>"Aurelius," quoth she, "by high God above,<br/>Yet will I grante you to be your love<br/>(Since I you see so piteously complain);<br/>Looke, what day that endelong Bretagne<br/>Ye remove all the rockes, stone by stone,<br/>That they not lette ship nor boat to gon,<br/>I say, when ye have made this coast so clean<br/>Of rockes, that there is no stone seen,<br/>Then will I love you best of any man;<br/>Have here my troth, in all that ever I can;<br/>For well I wot that it shall ne'er betide.<br/>Let such folly out of your hearte glide.<br/>What dainty should a man have in his life<br/>For to go love another manne's wife,<br/>That hath her body when that ever him liketh?"<br/>Aurelius full often sore siketh;<br/>Is there none other grace in you?" quoth he,<br/>"No, by that Lord," quoth she, "that maked me.<br/>Woe was Aurelius when that he this heard,<br/>And with a sorrowful heart he thus answer'd.<br/>"Madame, quoth he, "this were an impossible.<br/>Then must I die of sudden death horrible."<br/>And with that word he turned him anon.<br/><br/>Then came her other friends many a one,<br/>And in the alleys roamed up and down,<br/>And nothing wist of this conclusion,<br/>But suddenly began to revel new,<br/>Till that the brighte sun had lost his hue,<br/>For th' horizon had reft the sun his light<br/>(This is as much to say as it was night);<br/>And home they go in mirth and in solace;<br/>Save only wretch'd Aurelius, alas<br/>He to his house is gone with sorrowful heart.<br/>He said, he may not from his death astart.<br/>Him seemed, that he felt his hearte cold.<br/>Up to the heav'n his handes gan he hold,<br/>And on his knees bare he set him down.<br/>And in his raving said his orisoun.<br/>For very woe out of his wit he braid;<br/>He wist not what he spake, but thus he said;<br/>With piteous heart his plaint hath he begun<br/>Unto the gods, and first unto the Sun.<br/>He said; "Apollo God and governour<br/>Of every plante, herbe, tree, and flower,<br/>That giv'st, after thy declination,<br/>To each of them his time and his season,<br/>As thine herberow changeth low and high;<br/>Lord Phoebus: cast thy merciable eye<br/>On wretched Aurelius, which that am but lorn.<br/>Lo, lord, my lady hath my death y-sworn,<br/>Withoute guilt, but thy benignity<br/>Upon my deadly heart have some pity.<br/>For well I wot, Lord Phoebus, if you lest,<br/>Ye may me helpe, save my lady, best.<br/>Now vouchsafe, that I may you devise<br/>How that I may be holp, and in what wise.<br/>Your blissful sister, Lucina the sheen,<br/>That of the sea is chief goddess and queen, --<br/>Though Neptunus have deity in the sea,<br/>Yet emperess above him is she;  --<br/>Ye know well, lord, that, right as her desire<br/>Is to be quick'd and lighted of your fire,<br/>For which she followeth you full busily,<br/>Right so the sea desireth naturally<br/>To follow her, as she that is goddess<br/>Both in the sea and rivers more and less.<br/>Wherefore, Lord Phoebus, this is my request,<br/>Do this miracle, or do mine hearte brest;<br/>That flow, next at this opposition,<br/>Which in the sign shall be of the Lion,<br/>As praye her so great a flood to bring,<br/>That five fathom at least it overspring<br/>The highest rock in Armoric Bretagne,<br/>And let this flood endure yeares twain:<br/>Then certes to my lady may I say,<br/>"Holde your hest," the rockes be away.<br/>Lord Phoebus, this miracle do for me,<br/>Pray her she go no faster course than ye;<br/>I say this, pray your sister that she go<br/>No faster course than ye these yeares two:<br/>Then shall she be even at full alway,<br/>And spring-flood laste bothe night and day.<br/>And but she vouchesafe in such mannere<br/>To grante me my sov'reign lady dear,<br/>Pray her to sink every rock adown<br/>Into her owen darke regioun<br/>Under the ground, where Pluto dwelleth in<br/>Or nevermore shall I my lady win.<br/>Thy temple in Delphos will I barefoot seek.<br/>Lord Phoebus! see the teares on my cheek<br/>And on my pain have some compassioun."<br/>And with that word in sorrow he fell down,<br/>And longe time he lay forth in a trance.<br/>His brother, which that knew of his penance,<br/>Up caught him, and to bed he hath him brought,<br/>Despaired in this torment and this thought<br/>Let I this woeful creature lie;<br/>Choose he for me whe'er he will live or die.<br/><br/>Arviragus with health and great honour<br/>(As he that was of chivalry the flow'r)<br/>Is come home, and other worthy men.<br/>Oh, blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen!<br/>Thou hast thy lusty husband in thine arms,<br/>The freshe knight, the worthy man of arms,<br/>That loveth thee as his own hearte's life:<br/>Nothing list him to be imaginatif<br/>If any wight had spoke, while he was out,<br/>To her of love; he had of that no doubt;<br/>He not intended to no such mattere,<br/>But danced, jousted, and made merry cheer.<br/>And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell,<br/>And of the sick Aurelius will I tell<br/>In languor and in torment furious<br/>Two year and more lay wretch'd Aurelius,<br/>Ere any foot on earth he mighte gon;<br/>Nor comfort in this time had he none,<br/>Save of his brother, which that was a clerk.<br/>He knew of all this woe and all this work;<br/>For to none other creature certain<br/>Of this matter he durst no worde sayn;<br/>Under his breast he bare it more secree<br/>Than e'er did Pamphilus for Galatee.<br/>His breast was whole withoute for to seen,<br/>But in his heart aye was the arrow keen,<br/>And well ye know that of a sursanure<br/>In surgery is perilous the cure,<br/>But men might touch the arrow or come thereby.<br/>His brother wept and wailed privily,<br/>Till at the last him fell in remembrance,<br/>That while he was at Orleans  in France, --<br/>As younge clerkes, that be likerous --<br/>To readen artes that be curious,<br/>Seeken in every halk and every hern<br/>Particular sciences for to learn,--<br/>He him remember'd, that upon a day<br/>At Orleans in study a book he say<br/>Of magic natural, which his fellaw,<br/>That was that time a bachelor of law<br/>All were he there to learn another craft,<br/>Had privily upon his desk y-laft;<br/>Which book spake much of operations<br/>Touching the eight and-twenty mansions<br/>That longe to the Moon, and such folly<br/>As in our dayes is not worth a fly;<br/>For holy church's faith, in our believe,<br/>Us suff'reth none illusion to grieve.<br/>And when this book was in his remembrance<br/>Anon for joy his heart began to dance,<br/>And to himself he saide privily;<br/>"My brother shall be warish'd hastily<br/>For I am sicker that there be sciences,<br/>By which men make divers apparences,<br/>Such as these subtle tregetoures play.<br/>For oft at feaste's have I well heard say,<br/>That tregetours, within a halle large,<br/>Have made come in a water and a barge,<br/>And in the halle rowen up and down.<br/>Sometimes hath seemed come a grim lioun,<br/>And sometimes flowers spring as in a mead;<br/>Sometimes a vine, and grapes white and red;<br/>Sometimes a castle all of lime and stone;<br/>And, when them liked, voided it anon:<br/>Thus seemed it to every manne's sight.<br/>Now then conclude I thus; if that I might<br/>At Orleans some olde fellow find,<br/>That hath these Moone's mansions in mind,<br/>Or other magic natural above.<br/>He should well make my brother have his love.<br/>For with an appearance a clerk may make,<br/>To manne's sight, that all the rockes blake<br/>Of Bretagne were voided every one,<br/>And shippes by the brinke come and gon,<br/>And in such form endure a day or two;<br/>Then were my brother warish'd of his woe,<br/>Then must she needes holde her behest,<br/>Or elles he shall shame her at the least."<br/>Why should I make a longer tale of this?<br/>Unto his brother's bed he comen is,<br/>And such comfort he gave him, for to gon<br/>To Orleans, that he upstart anon,<br/>And on his way forth-ward then is he fare,<br/>In hope for to be lissed of his care.<br/><br/>When they were come almost to that city,<br/>But if it were a two furlong or three,<br/>A young clerk roaming by himself they met,<br/>Which that in Latin thriftily them gret.<br/>And after that he said a wondrous thing;<br/>I know," quoth he, "the cause of your coming;"<br/>Aud ere they farther any foote went,<br/>He told them all that was in their intent.<br/>The Breton clerk him asked of fellaws<br/>The which he hadde known in olde daws,<br/>And he answer'd him that they deade were,<br/>For which he wept full often many a tear.<br/>Down off his horse Aurelius light anon,<br/>And forth with this magician is be gone<br/>Home to his house, and made him well at ease;<br/>Them lacked no vitail that might them please.<br/>So well-array'd a house as there was one,<br/>Aurelius in his life saw never none.<br/>He shewed him, ere they went to suppere,<br/>Forestes, parkes, full of wilde deer.<br/>There saw he hartes with their hornes high,<br/>The greatest that were ever seen with eye.<br/>He saw of them an hundred slain with hounds,<br/>And some with arrows bleed of bitter wounds.<br/>He saw, when voided were the wilde deer,<br/>These falconers upon a fair rivere,<br/>That with their hawkes have the heron slain.<br/>Then saw he knightes jousting in a plain.<br/>And after this he did him such pleasance,<br/>That he him shew'd his lady on a dance,<br/>In which himselfe danced, as him thought.<br/>And when this master, that this magic wrought,<br/>Saw it was time, he clapp'd his handes two,<br/>And farewell, all the revel is y-go.<br/>And yet remov'd they never out of the house,<br/>While they saw all the sightes marvellous;<br/>But in his study, where his bookes be,<br/>They satte still, and no wight but they three.<br/>To him this master called his squier,<br/><br/>And said him thus, "May we go to supper?<br/>Almost an hour it is, I undertake,<br/>Since I you bade our supper for to make,<br/>When that these worthy men wente with me<br/>Into my study, where my bookes be."<br/>"Sir," quoth this squier, "when it liketh you.<br/>It is all ready, though ye will right now."<br/>"Go we then sup," quoth he, "as for the best;<br/>These amorous folk some time must have rest."<br/>At after supper fell they in treaty<br/>What summe should this master's guerdon be,<br/>To remove all the rockes of Bretagne,<br/>And eke from Gironde  to the mouth of Seine.<br/>He made it strange, and swore, so God him save,<br/>Less than a thousand pound he would not have,<br/>Nor gladly for that sum he would not gon.<br/>Aurelius with blissful heart anon<br/>Answered thus; "Fie on a thousand pound!<br/>This wide world, which that men say is round,<br/>I would it give, if I were lord of it.<br/>This bargain is full-driv'n, for we be knit;<br/>Ye shall be payed truly by my troth.<br/>But looke, for no negligence or sloth,<br/>Ye tarry us here no longer than to-morrow."<br/>"Nay," quoth the clerk, "have here my faith to borrow."<br/>To bed is gone Aurelius when him lest,<br/>And well-nigh all that night he had his rest,<br/>What for his labour, and his hope of bliss,<br/>His woeful heart of penance had a liss.<br/><br/>Upon the morrow, when that it was day,<br/>Unto Bretagne they took the righte way,<br/>Aurelius and this magician beside,<br/>And be descended where they would abide:<br/>And this was, as the bookes me remember,<br/>The colde frosty season of December.<br/>Phoebus wax'd old, and hued like latoun,<br/>That in his hote declinatioun<br/>Shone as the burned gold, with streames bright;<br/>But now in Capricorn adown he light,<br/>Where as he shone full pale, I dare well sayn.<br/>The bitter frostes, with the sleet and rain,<br/>Destroyed have the green in every yard.<br/>Janus sits by the fire with double beard,<br/>And drinketh of his bugle horn the wine:<br/>Before him stands the brawn of tusked swine<br/>And "nowel" crieth every lusty man<br/>Aurelius, in all that ev'r he can,<br/>Did to his master cheer and reverence,<br/>And prayed him to do his diligence<br/>To bringe him out of his paines smart,<br/>Or with a sword that he would slit his heart.<br/>This subtle clerk such ruth had on this man,<br/>That night and day he sped him, that he can,<br/>To wait a time of his conclusion;<br/>This is to say, to make illusion,<br/>By such an appearance of jugglery<br/>(I know no termes of astrology),<br/>That she and every wight should ween and say,<br/>That of Bretagne the rockes were away,<br/>Or else they were sunken under ground.<br/>So at the last he hath a time found<br/>To make his japes and his wretchedness<br/>Of such a superstitious cursedness.<br/>His tables Toletanes  forth he brought,<br/>Full well corrected, that there lacked nought,<br/>Neither his collect, nor his expanse years,<br/>Neither his rootes, nor his other gears,<br/>As be his centres, and his arguments,<br/>And his proportional convenients<br/>For his equations in everything.<br/>And by his eighte spheres in his working,<br/>He knew full well how far Alnath  was shove<br/>From the head of that fix'd Aries above,<br/>That in the ninthe sphere consider'd is.<br/>Full subtilly he calcul'd all this.<br/>When he had found his firste mansion,<br/>He knew the remnant by proportion;<br/>And knew the rising of his moone well,<br/>And in whose face, and term, and every deal;<br/>And knew full well the moone's mansion<br/>Accordant to his operation;<br/>And knew also his other observances,<br/>For such illusions and such meschances,<br/>As heathen folk used in thilke days.<br/>For which no longer made he delays;<br/>But through his magic, for a day or tway,<br/>It seemed all the rockes were away.<br/><br/>Aurelius, which yet despaired is<br/>Whe'er he shall have his love, or fare amiss,<br/>Awaited night and day on this miracle:<br/>And when he knew that there was none obstacle,<br/>That voided were these rockes every one,<br/>Down at his master's feet he fell anon,<br/>And said; "I, woeful wretch'd Aurelius,<br/>Thank you, my Lord, and lady mine Venus,<br/>That me have holpen from my cares cold."<br/>And to the temple his way forth hath he hold,<br/>Where as he knew he should his lady see.<br/>And when he saw his time, anon right he<br/>With dreadful heart and with full humble cheer<br/>Saluteth hath his sovereign lady dear.<br/>"My rightful Lady," quoth this woeful man,<br/>"Whom I most dread, and love as I best can,<br/>And lothest were of all this world displease,<br/>Were't not that I for you have such disease,<br/>That I must die here at your foot anon,<br/>Nought would I tell how me is woebegone.<br/>But certes either must I die or plain;<br/>Ye slay me guilteless for very pain.<br/>But of my death though that ye have no ruth,<br/>Advise you, ere that ye break your truth:<br/>Repente you, for thilke God above,<br/>Ere ye me slay because that I you love.<br/>For, Madame, well ye wot what ye have hight;<br/>Not that I challenge anything of right<br/>Of you,  my sovereign lady, but of grace:<br/>But in a garden yond', in such a place,<br/>Ye wot right well what ye behighte me,<br/>And in mine hand your trothe plighted ye,<br/>To love me best; God wot ye saide so,<br/>Albeit that I unworthy am thereto;<br/>Madame, I speak it for th' honour of you,<br/>More than to save my hearte's life right now;<br/>I have done so as ye commanded me,<br/>And if ye vouchesafe, ye may go see.<br/>Do as you list, have your behest in mind,<br/>For, quick or dead, right there ye shall me find;<br/>In you hes all to do me live or dey;<br/>But well I wot the rockes be away."<br/><br/>He took his leave, and she astonish'd stood;<br/>In all her face was not one drop of blood:<br/>She never ween'd t'have come in such a trap.<br/>"Alas!" quoth she, "that ever this should hap!<br/>For ween'd I ne'er, by possibility,<br/>That such a monster or marvail might be;<br/>It is against the process of nature."<br/>And home she went a sorrowful creature;<br/>For very fear unnethes may she go.<br/>She weeped, wailed, all a day or two,<br/>And swooned, that it ruthe was to see:<br/>But why it was, to no wight tolde she,<br/>For out of town was gone Arviragus.<br/>But to herself she spake, and saide thus,<br/>With face pale, and full sorrowful cheer,<br/>In her complaint, as ye shall after hear.<br/>"Alas!" quoth she, "on thee, Fortune, I plain,<br/>That unware hast me wrapped in thy chain,<br/>From which to scape, wot I no succour,<br/>Save only death, or elles dishonour;<br/>One of these two behoveth me to choose.<br/>But natheless, yet had I lever lose<br/>My life, than of my body have shame,<br/>Or know myselfe false, or lose my name;<br/>And with my death I may be quit y-wis.<br/>Hath there not many a noble wife, ere this,<br/>And many a maiden, slain herself, alas!<br/>Rather than with her body do trespass?<br/>Yes, certes; lo, these stories bear witness.<br/>When thirty tyrants full of cursedness<br/>Had slain Phidon in Athens at the feast,<br/>They commanded his daughters to arrest,<br/>And bringe them before them, in despite,<br/>All naked, to fulfil their foul delight;<br/>And in their father's blood they made them dance<br/>Upon the pavement, -- God give them mischance.<br/>For which these woeful maidens, full of dread,<br/>Rather than they would lose their maidenhead,<br/>They privily be start into a well,<br/>And drowned themselves, as the bookes tell.<br/>They of Messene let inquire and seek<br/>Of Lacedaemon fifty maidens eke,<br/>On which they woulde do their lechery:<br/>But there was none of all that company<br/>That was not slain, and with a glad intent<br/>Chose rather for to die, than to assent<br/>To be oppressed of her maidenhead.<br/>Why should I then to dien be in dread?<br/>Lo, eke the tyrant Aristoclides,<br/>That lov'd a maiden hight Stimphalides,<br/>When that her father slain was on a night,<br/>Unto Diana's temple went she right,<br/>And hent the image in her handes two,<br/>From which image she woulde never go;<br/>No wight her handes might off it arace,<br/>Till she was slain right in the selfe place.<br/>Now since that maidens hadde such despite<br/>To be defouled with man's foul delight,<br/>Well ought a wife rather herself to sle,<br/>Than be defouled, as it thinketh me.<br/>What shall I say of Hasdrubale's wife,<br/>That at Carthage bereft herself of life?<br/>For, when she saw the Romans win the town,<br/>She took her children all, and skipt adown<br/>Into the fire, and rather chose to die,<br/>Than any Roman did her villainy.<br/>Hath not Lucretia slain herself, alas!<br/>At Rome, when that she oppressed was<br/>Of Tarquin? for her thought it was a shame<br/>To live, when she hadde lost her name.<br/>The seven maidens of Milesie also<br/>Have slain themselves for very dread and woe,<br/>Rather than folk of Gaul them should oppress.<br/>More than a thousand stories, as I guess,<br/>Could I now tell as touching this mattere.<br/>When Abradate was slain, his wife so dear<br/>Herselfe slew, and let her blood to glide<br/>In Abradate's woundes, deep and wide,<br/>And said, 'My body at the leaste way<br/>There shall no wight defoul, if that I may.'<br/>Why should I more examples hereof sayn?<br/>Since that so many have themselves slain,<br/>Well rather than they would defouled be,<br/>I will conclude that it is bet for me<br/>To slay myself, than be defouled thus.<br/>I will be true unto Arviragus,<br/>Or elles slay myself in some mannere,<br/>As did Demotione's daughter dear,<br/>Because she woulde not defouled be.<br/>O Sedasus, it is full great pity<br/>To reade how thy daughters died, alas!<br/>That slew themselves for suche manner cas.<br/>As great a pity was it, or well more,<br/>The Theban maiden, that for Nicanor<br/>Herselfe slew, right for such manner woe.<br/>Another Theban maiden did right so;<br/>For one of Macedon had her oppress'd,<br/>She with her death her maidenhead redress'd.<br/>What shall I say of Niceratus' wife,<br/>That for such case bereft herself her life?<br/>How true was eke to Alcibiades<br/>His love, that for to dien rather chese,<br/>Than for to suffer his body unburied be?<br/>Lo, what a wife was Alceste?" quoth she.<br/>"What saith Homer of good Penelope?<br/>All Greece knoweth of her chastity.<br/>Pardie, of Laedamia is written thus,<br/>That when at Troy was slain Protesilaus,<br/>No longer would she live after his day.<br/>The same of noble Porcia tell I may;<br/>Withoute Brutus coulde she not live,<br/>To whom she did all whole her hearte give.<br/>The perfect wifehood of Artemisie<br/>Honoured is throughout all Barbarie.<br/>O Teuta  queen, thy wifely chastity<br/>To alle wives may a mirror be."<br/><br/>Thus plained Dorigen a day or tway,<br/>Purposing ever that she woulde dey;<br/>But natheless upon the thirde night<br/>Home came Arviragus, the worthy knight,<br/>And asked her why that she wept so sore.<br/>And she gan weepen ever longer more.<br/>"Alas," quoth she, "that ever I was born!<br/>Thus have I said," quoth she; "thus have I sworn. "<br/>And told him all, as ye have heard before:<br/>It needeth not rehearse it you no more.<br/>This husband with glad cheer, in friendly wise,<br/>Answer'd and said, as I shall you devise.<br/>"Is there aught elles, Dorigen, but this?"<br/>"Nay, nay," quoth she, "God help me so, as wis<br/>This is too much, an it were Godde's will."<br/>"Yea, wife," quoth he, "let sleepe what is still,<br/>It may be well par'venture yet to-day.<br/>Ye shall your trothe holde, by my fay.<br/>For, God so wisly have mercy on me,<br/>I had well lever sticked for to be,<br/>For very love which I to you have,<br/>But if ye should your trothe keep and save.<br/>Truth is the highest thing that man may keep."<br/>But with that word he burst anon to weep,<br/>And said; "I you forbid, on pain of death,<br/>That never, while you lasteth life or breath,<br/>To no wight tell ye this misaventure;<br/>As I may best, I will my woe endure,<br/>Nor make no countenance of heaviness,<br/>That folk of you may deeme harm, or guess."<br/>And forth he call'd a squier and a maid.<br/>"Go forth anon with Dorigen," he said,<br/>"And bringe her to such a place anon."<br/>They take their leave, and on their way they gon:<br/>But they not wiste why she thither went;<br/>He would to no wight telle his intent.<br/><br/>This squier, which that hight Aurelius,<br/>On Dorigen that was so amorous,<br/>Of aventure happen'd her to meet<br/>Amid the town, right in the quickest street,<br/>As she was bound to go the way forthright<br/>Toward the garden, there as she had hight.<br/>And he was to the garden-ward also;<br/>For well he spied when she woulde go<br/>Out of her house, to any manner place;<br/>But thus they met, of aventure or grace,<br/>And he saluted her with glad intent,<br/>And asked of her whitherward she went.<br/>And she answered, half as she were mad,<br/>"Unto the garden, as my husband bade,<br/>My trothe for to hold, alas! alas!"<br/>Aurelius gan to wonder on this case,<br/>And in his heart had great compassion<br/>Of her, and of her lamentation,<br/>And of Arviragus, the worthy knight,<br/>That bade her hold all that she hadde hight;<br/>So loth him was his wife should break her truth<br/>And in his heart he caught of it great ruth,<br/>Considering the best on every side,<br/>That from his lust yet were him lever abide,<br/>Than do so high a churlish wretchedness<br/>Against franchise, and alle gentleness;<br/>For which in fewe words he saide thus;<br/>"Madame, say to your lord Arviragus,<br/>That since I see the greate gentleness<br/>Of him, and eke I see well your distress,<br/>That him were lever have shame (and that were ruth)<br/>Than ye to me should breake thus your truth,<br/>I had well lever aye to suffer woe,<br/>Than to depart the love betwixt you two.<br/>I you release, Madame, into your hond,<br/>Quit ev'ry surement and ev'ry bond,<br/>That ye have made to me as herebeforn,<br/>Since thilke time that ye were born.<br/>Have here my truth, I shall you ne'er repreve<br/>Of no behest; and here I take my leave,<br/>As of the truest and the beste wife<br/>That ever yet I knew in all my life.<br/>But every wife beware of her behest;<br/>On Dorigen remember at the least.<br/>Thus can a squier do a gentle deed,<br/>As well as can a knight, withoute drede."<br/><br/>She thanked him upon her knees bare,<br/>And home unto her husband is she fare,<br/>And told him all, as ye have hearde said;<br/>And, truste me, he was so well apaid,<br/>That it were impossible me to write.<br/>Why should I longer of this case indite?<br/>Arviragus and Dorigen his wife<br/>In sov'reign blisse ledde forth their life;<br/>Ne'er after was there anger them between;<br/>He cherish'd her as though she were a queen,<br/>And she was to him true for evermore;<br/>Of these two folk ye get of me no more.<br/><br/>Aurelius, that his cost had all forlorn,<br/>Cursed the time that ever he was born.<br/>"Alas!" quoth he, "alas that I behight<br/>Of pured gold a thousand pound of weight<br/>To this philosopher! how shall I do?<br/>I see no more, but that I am fordo.<br/>Mine heritage must I needes sell,<br/>And be a beggar; here I will not dwell,<br/>And shamen all my kindred in this place,<br/>But I of him may gette better grace.<br/>But natheless I will of him assay<br/>At certain dayes year by year to pay,<br/>And thank him of his greate courtesy.<br/>My trothe will I keep, I will not he."<br/>With hearte sore he went unto his coffer,<br/>And broughte gold unto this philosopher,<br/>The value of five hundred pound, I guess,<br/>And him beseeched, of his gentleness,<br/>To grant him dayes of the remenant;<br/>And said; "Master, I dare well make avaunt,<br/>I failed never of my truth as yet.<br/>For sickerly my debte shall be quit<br/>Towardes you how so that e'er I fare<br/>To go a-begging in my kirtle bare:<br/>But would ye vouchesafe, upon surety,<br/>Two year, or three, for to respite me,<br/>Then were I well, for elles must I sell<br/>Mine heritage; there is no more to tell."<br/><br/>This philosopher soberly answer'd,<br/>And saide thus, when he these wordes heard;<br/>"Have I not holden covenant to thee?"<br/>"Yes, certes, well and truely," quoth he.<br/>"Hast thou not had thy lady as thee liked?"<br/>"No, no," quoth he, and sorrowfully siked.<br/>"What was the cause? tell me if thou can."<br/>Aurelius his tale anon began,<br/>And told him all as ye have heard before,<br/>It needeth not to you rehearse it more.<br/>He said, "Arviragus of gentleness<br/>Had lever die in sorrow and distress,<br/>Than that his wife were of her trothe false."<br/>The sorrow of Dorigen he told him als',<br/>How loth her was to be a wicked wife,<br/>And that she lever had lost that day her life;<br/>And that her troth she swore through innocence;<br/>She ne'er erst had heard speak of apparence<br/>That made me have of her so great pity,<br/>And right as freely as he sent her to me,<br/>As freely sent I her to him again:<br/>This is all and some, there is no more to sayn."<br/><br/>The philosopher answer'd; "Leve brother,<br/>Evereach of you did gently to the other;<br/>Thou art a squier, and he is a knight,<br/>But God forbidde, for his blissful might,<br/>But if a clerk could do a gentle deed<br/>As well as any of you, it is no drede<br/>Sir, I release thee thy thousand pound,<br/>As thou right now were crept out of the ground,<br/>Nor ever ere now haddest knowen me.<br/>For, Sir, I will not take a penny of thee<br/>For all my craft, nor naught for my travail;<br/>Thou hast y-payed well for my vitaille;<br/>It is enough; and farewell, have good day."<br/>And took his horse, and forth he went his way.<br/>Lordings, this question would I aske now,<br/>Which was the moste free, as thinketh you?<br/>Now telle me, ere that ye farther wend.<br/>I can no more, my tale is at an end.
