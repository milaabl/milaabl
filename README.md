# üíÆ Saul by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    Said Abner, "At last thou art come! Ere I tell, ere thou speak.<br/>Kiss my cheek, wish me well!" Then I wished it, and did kiss his cheek.<br/>And he, "Since the King, O my friend, for thy countenance sent,<br/>Neither drunken nor eaten have we; nor until from his tent<br/>Thou return with the joyful assurance the King liveth yet,<br/>Shall our lip with the honey be bright, with the water be wet.<br/>For out of the black mid-tent's silence, a space of three days,<br/>Not a sound hath escaped to thy servants, of prayer nor of praise,<br/>To betoken that Saul and the Spirit have ended their strife,<br/>And that, faint in his triumph, the monarch sinks back upon life.<br/><br/>"Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! God's child with his dew<br/>On thy gracious gold hair, and those lilies still living and blue<br/>Just broken to twine round thy harp-strings, as if no wild heat<br/>Were now raging to torture the desert!"<br/><br/>                                Then I, as was meet,<br/>Knelt down to the God of my fathers, and rose on my feet,<br/>And ran o'er the sand burnt to powder. The tent was unlooped;<br/>I pulled up the spear that obstructed, and under I stooped;<br/>Hands and knees on the slippery grass-patch, all withered and gone,<br/>That extends to the second enclosure. I groped my way on<br/>Till I felt where the foldskirts fly open. Then once more I prayed,<br/>And opened the foldskirts and entered, and was not afraid<br/>But spoke, "Here is David, thy servant!" And no voice replied.<br/>At the first I saw naught but the blackness; but soon I descried<br/>A something more black than the blackness--the vast, the upright<br/>Main prop which sustains the pavilion: and slow into sight<br/>Grew a figure against it, gigantic and blackest of all.<br/>Then a sunbeam, that burst thro' the tent roof, showed Saul.<br/><br/>He stood erect as that tent-prop, both arms stretched out wide<br/>On the great cross-support in the centre, that goes to each side;<br/>He relaxed not a muscle, but hung there as, caught in his pangs<br/>And waiting his change, the king serpent all heavily hangs,<br/>Far away from his kind, in the pine, till deliverance come<br/>With the spring-time,--so agonized Saul, drear and stark, blind and dumb.<br/><br/>Then I tuned my harp,--took off the lilies we twine round its chords<br/>Lest they snap 'neath the stress of the noontide--those sunbeams like swords!<br/>And I first played the tune all our sheep know, as, one after one,<br/>So docile they come to the pen-door till folding be done.<br/>They are white and untorn by the bushes, for lo, they have fed<br/>Where the long grasses stifle the water within the stream's bed;<br/>And now one after one seeks its lodging, as star follows star<br/>Into eve and the blue far above us,--so, blue and so far!<br/><br/>--Then the tune, for which quails on the cornland will each leave his mate<br/>To fly after the player; then, what makes the crickets elate<br/>Till for boldness they fight one another: and then, what has weight<br/>To set the quick jerboa a-musing outside his sand house--<br/>There are none such as he for a wonder, half bird and half mouse!<br/>God made all the creatures and gave them our love and our fear,<br/>To give sign, we and they are his children, one family here.<br/><br/>Then I played the help-tune of our reapers, their wine-song, when hand<br/>Grasps at hand, eye lights eye in good friendship, and great hearts expand<br/>And grow one in the sense of this world's life.--And then, the last song<br/>When the dead man is praised on his journey--"Bear, bear him along<br/>With his few faults shut up like dead flowerets!" Are balm-seeds not here<br/>To console us? The land has none left such as he on the bier.<br/>"Oh, would we might keep thee, my brother!"--And then, the glad chaunt<br/>Of the marriage,--first go the young maidens, next, she whom we vaunt<br/>As the beauty, the pride of our dwelling.--And then, the great march<br/>Wherein man runs to man to assist him and buttress an arch<br/>Naught can break; who shall harm them, our friends?--Then, the chorus intoned<br/>As the Levites go up to the altar in glory enthroned.<br/>But I stopped here: for here in the darkness Saul groaned.<br/><br/>And I paused, held my breath in such silence, and listened apart;<br/>And the tent shook, for mighty Saul shuddered: and sparkles 'gan dart<br/>From the jewels that woke in his turban, at once with a start,<br/>All its lordly male-sapphires, and rubies courageous at heart.<br/>So the head: but the body still moved not, still hung there erect.<br/>And I bent once again to my playing, pursued it unchecked,<br/>As I sang,--<br/><br/>                "Oh, our manhood's prime vigor! No spirit feels waste,<br/>Not a muscle is stopped in its playing nor sinew unbraced.<br/>Oh, the wild joys of living! the leaping from rock up to rock,<br/>The strong rending of boughs from the fir-tree, the cool silver shock<br/>Of the plunge in a pool's living water, the hunt of the bear,<br/>And the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair.<br/>And the meal, the rich dates yellowed over with gold-dust divine,<br/>And the locust-flesh steeped in the pitcher, the full draught of wine,<br/>And the sleep in the dried river-channel where bulrushes tell<br/>That the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well.<br/>How good is man's life, the mere living! how fit to employ<br/>All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy!<br/>Hast thou loved the white locks of thy father, whose sword thou didst guard<br/>When he trusted thee forth with the armies, for glorious reward?<br/>Didst thou see the thin hands of thy mother, held up as men sung<br/>The low song of the nearly departed, and hear her faint tongue<br/>Joining in while it could to the witness, 'Let one more attest,<br/>I have lived, seen God's hand thro' a lifetime, and all was for best!'<br/>Then they sung thro' their tears in strong triumph, not much, but the rest.<br/>And thy brothers, the help and the contest, the working whence grew<br/>Such result as, from seething grape-bundles, the spirit strained true:<br/>And the friends of thy boyhood--that boyhood of wonder and hope,<br/>Present promise and wealth of the future beyond the eye's scope,--<br/>Till lo, thou art grown to a monarch; a people is thine:<br/>And all gifts which the world offers singly, on one head combine!<br/>On one head, all the beauty and strength, love and rage (like the throe<br/>That, a-work in the rock, helps its labour and lets the gold go),<br/>High ambition and deeds which surpass it, fame crowning them,--all<br/>Brought to blaze on the head of one creature--King Saul!"<br/><br/>And lo, with that leap of my spirit,--heart, hand, harp, and voice,<br/>Each lifting Saul's name out of sorrow, each bidding rejoice<br/>Saul's fame in the light it was made for----as when, dare I say,<br/>The Lord's army, in rapture of service, strains thro' its array,<br/>And upsoareth the cherubim-chariot--"Saul!" cried I, and stopped,<br/>And waited the thing that should follow. Then Saul, who hung propped<br/>By the tent's cross-support in the centre, was struck by his name.<br/>Have ye seen when Spring's arrowy summons goes right to the aim,<br/>And some mountain, the last to withstand her, that held (he alone,<br/>While the vale laughed in freedom and flowers) on a broad bust of stone<br/>A year's snow bound about for a breastplate,--leaves grasp of the sheet?<br/>Fold on fold all at once it crowds thunderously down to his feet,<br/>And there fronts you, stark, black, but alive yet, your mountain of old,<br/>With his rents, the successive bequeathings of ages untold:<br/>Yea, each harm got in fighting your battles, each furrow and scar<br/>Of his head thrust 'twixt you and the tempest--all hail, there they are!<br/>--Now again to be softened with verdure, again hold the nest<br/>Of the dove, tempt the goat and its young to the green on his crest<br/>For their food in the ardours of summer. One long shudder thrilled.<br/>All the tent till the very air tingled, then sank and was stilled<br/>At the King's self left standing before me, released and aware.<br/>What was gone, what remained? All to traverse 'twixt hope and despair.<br/>Death was past, life not come; so he waited. Awhile his right hand<br/>Held the brow, helped the eyes left too vacant, forthwith to remand<br/>To their place what new objects should enter: 'twas Saul as before.<br/>I looked up, and dared gaze at those eyes, nor was hurt any more<br/>Than by slow pallid sunsets in autumn, ye watch from the shore,<br/>At their sad level gaze o'er the ocean--a sun's slow decline<br/>Over hills which, resolved in stern silence, o'erlap and entwine<br/>Base with base to knit strength more intensely: so, arm folded arm<br/>O'er the chest whose slow heavings subsided.<br/><br/>                                        What spell or what charm,<br/>(For, awhile there was trouble within me) what next should I urge<br/>To sustain him where song had restored, him? Song filled to the verge<br/>His cup with the wine of this life, pressing all that it yields<br/>Of mere fruitage, the strength and the beauty: beyond, on what fields<br/>Glean a vintage more potent and perfect to brighten the eye,<br/>And bring blood to the lip, and commend them the cup they put by?<br/>He saith, "It is good:" still he drinks not: he lets me praise life,<br/>Gives assent, yet would die for his own part.<br/><br/>                                            Then fancies grew rife<br/>Which had come long ago on the pasture, when round me the sheep<br/>Fed in silence--above, the one eagle wheeled slow as in sleep;<br/>And I lay in my hollow and mused on the world that might lie<br/>'Neath his ken, tho' I saw but the strip 'twixt the hill and the sky:<br/>And I laughed--"Since my days are ordained to be passed with my flocks,<br/>Let me people at least, with my fancies, the plains and the rocks,<br/>Dream the life I am never to mix with, and image the show<br/>Of mankind as they live in those fashions I hardly shall know!<br/>Schemes of life, its best rules and right uses, the courage that gains,<br/>And the prudence that keeps what men strive for!" And now these old trains<br/>Of vague thought came again; I grew surer; so, once more the string<br/>Of my harp made response to my spirit, as thus--<br/><br/>                                                "Yea, my King,"<br/>I began--"thou dost well in rejecting mere comforts that spring<br/>From the mere mortal life held in common by man and by brute:<br/>In our flesh grows the branch of this life, in our soul it bears fruit.<br/>Thou hast marked the slow rise of the tree,--how its stem trembled first<br/>Till it passed the kid's lip, the stag's antler; then safely outburst<br/>The fan-branches all round; and thou mindest when these too, in turn<br/>Broke a-bloom and the palm-tree seemed perfect: yet more was to learn,<br/>E'en the good that comes in with the palm-fruit. Our dates shall we slight,<br/>When their juice brings a cure for all sorrow? or care for the plight<br/>Of the palm's self whose slow growth produced them? Not so! stem and branch.<br/>Shall decay, nor be known in their place, while the palm-wine shall staunch<br/>Every wound of man's spirit in winter. I pour thee such wine.<br/>Leave the flesh to the fate it was fit for! the spirit be thine!<br/>By the spirit, when age shall o'ercome thee, thou still shalt enjoy<br/>More indeed, than at first when, inconscious, the life of a boy.<br/>Crush that life, and behold its wine running! Each deed thou hast done<br/>Dies, revives, goes to work in the world; until e'en as the sun<br/>Looking down on the earth, tho' clouds spoil him, tho' tempests efface,<br/>Can find nothing his own deed produced not, must everywhere trace<br/>The results of his past summer-prime,--so, each ray of thy will.<br/>Every flash of thy passion and prowess, long over, shall thrill<br/>Thy whole people, the countless, with ardour, till they too give forth<br/>A like cheer to their sons: who in turn, fill the South and the North<br/>With the radiance thy deed was the germ of. Carouse in the past!<br/>But the license of age has its limit; thou diest at last.<br/>As the lion, when age dims his eyeball, the rose at her height,<br/>So with man--so his power and his beauty forever take flight.<br/>No! Again a long draught of my soul-wine! Look forth o'er the years!<br/>Thou hast done now with eyes for the actual; begin with the seer's!<br/>Is Saul dead? In the depth of the vale make his tomb--bid arise<br/>A gray mountain of marble heaped four-square, till, built to the skies,<br/>Let it mark where the great First King slumbers: whose fame would ye know?<br/>Up above see the rock's naked face, where the record shall go<br/>In great characters cut by the scribe,--Such was Saul, so he did;<br/>With the sages directing the work, by the populace chid,--<br/>For not half, they'll affirm, is comprised there! Which fault to amend,<br/>In the grove with his kind grows the cedar, whereon they shall spend<br/>(See, in tablets 'tis level before them) their praise, and record<br/>With the gold of the graver, Saul's story,--the statesman's great word.<br/>Side by side with the poet's sweet comment. The river's a-wave<br/>With smooth paper-reeds grazing each other when prophet-winds rave;<br/>So the pen gives unborn generations their due and their part<br/>In thy being! Then, first of the mighty, thank God that thou art!"<br/><br/>And behold while I sang ... but O Thou who didst grant me that day,<br/>And before it not seldom had granted Thy help to essay.<br/>Carry on and complete an adventure,--my shield and my sword<br/>In that act where my soul was Thy servant, Thy word was my word,--<br/>Still be with me, who then at the summit of human endeavour<br/>And scaling the highest, man's thought could, gazed hopeless as ever<br/>On the new stretch of heaven above me--till, mighty to save,<br/>Just one lift of Thy hand cleared that distance--God's throne from man's grave!<br/>Let me tell out my tale to its ending--my voice to my heart<br/>Which can scarce dare believe in what marvels last night I took part,<br/>As this morning I gather the fragments, alone with my sheep,<br/>And still fear lest the terrible glory evanish like sleep!<br/>For I wake in the gray dewy covert, while Hebron, upheaves<br/>The dawn struggling with night on his shoulder, and Kidron retrieves<br/>Slow the damage of yesterday's sunshine.<br/><br/>                                          I say then,--my song<br/>While I sang thus, assuring the monarch, and, ever more strong,<br/>Made a proffer of good to console him--he slowly resumed.<br/>His old motions and habitudes kingly. The right hand replumed<br/>His black locks to their wonted composure, adjusted the swathes<br/>Of his turban, and see--the huge sweat that his countenance bathes,<br/>He wipes off with the robe; and he girds now his loins as of yore,<br/>And feels slow for the armlets of price, with the clasp set before,<br/>He is Saul, ye remember in glory,--ere error had bent<br/>The broad brow from the daily communion; and still, tho' much spent<br/>Be the life and bearing that front you, the same, God did choose,<br/>To receive what a man may waste, desecrate, never quite lose.<br/>So sank he along by the tent-prop, till, stayed by the pile<br/>Of his armour and war-cloak and garments, he leaned there awhile,<br/>And sat out my singing,--one arm round the tent-prop, to raise<br/>His bent head, and the other hung slack--till I touched on the praise<br/>I foresaw from all men in all time, to the man patient there;<br/>And thus ended, the harp falling forward. Then first I was 'ware<br/>That he sat, as I say, with my head just above his vast knees<br/>Which were thrust out each side around me, like oak roots which please<br/>To encircle a lamb when it slumbers. I looked up to know<br/>If the best I could do had brought solace: he spoke not, but slow<br/>Lifted up the hand slack at his side, till he laid it with care<br/>Soft and grave, but in mild settled will, on my brow: thro' my hair<br/>The large fingers were pushed, and he bent back my head, with kind power--<br/>All my face back, intent to peruse it, as men do a flower.<br/>Thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine--<br/>And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign?<br/>I yearned--"Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss,<br/>I would add, to that life of the past, both the future and this;<br/>I would give thee new life altogether, as good, ages hence.<br/>As this moment,--had love but the warrant, love's heart to dispense!"<br/><br/>Then the truth came upon me. No harp more--no song more! outbroke--<br/><br/>"I have gone the whole round of creation: I saw and I spoke;<br/>I, a work of God's hand for that purpose, received in my brain<br/>And pronounced on the rest of his handwork--returned him again<br/>His creation's approval or censure: I spoke as I saw,<br/>Reported, as man may of God's work--all's love, yet all's law.<br/>Now I lay down the judgeship he lent me. Each faculty tasked<br/>To perceive him has gained an abyss, where a dewdrop was asked.<br/>Have I knowledge? confounded it shrivels at Wisdom laid bare.<br/>Have I forethought? how purblind, how blank, to the Infinite Care!<br/>Do I task any faculty highest, to image success?<br/>I but open my eyes,--and perfection, no more and no less,<br/>In the kind I imagined, full-fronts me, and God is seen God<br/>In the star, in the stone, in the flesh, in the soul and the clod.<br/>And thus looking within and around me, I ever renew<br/>(With that stoop of the soul which in bending upraises it too)<br/>The submission of man's nothing-perfect to God's all complete,<br/>As by each new obeisance in spirit, I climb to His feet.<br/>Yet with all this abounding experience, this deity known,<br/>I shall dare to discover some province, some gift of my own,<br/>There's a faculty pleasant to exercise, hard to hoodwink,<br/>I am fain to keep still in abeyance (I laugh as I think),<br/>Lest, insisting to claim and parade in it, wot ye, I worst<br/>E'en the Giver in one gift.--Behold, I could love if I durst!<br/>But I sink the pretension as fearing a man may o'ertake<br/>God's own speed in the one way of love; I abstain for love's sake.<br/>--What, my soul? see thus far and no farther? when doors great and small,<br/>Nine-and-ninety flew ope at our touch; should the hundredth appal?<br/>In the least things have faith, yet distrust in the greatest of all?<br/>Do I find love so full in my nature, God's ultimate gift,<br/>That I doubt His own love can compete with it? Here, the parts shift?<br/>Here, the creature surpass the creator,--the end, what began?<br/>Would I fain in my impotent yearning do all for this man,<br/>And dare doubt He alone shall not help him, who yet alone can?<br/>Would it ever have entered my mind, the bare will, much less power,<br/>To bestow on this Saul what I sang of, the marvellous dower<br/>Of the life he was gifted and filled with? to make such a soul,<br/>Such a body, and then such an earth for insphering the whole?<br/>And doth it not enter my mind (as my warm tears attest),<br/>These good things being given, to go on, and give one more, the best?<br/>Ay, to save and redeem and restore him, maintain at the height<br/>This perfection,--succeed with life's dayspring, death's minute of night?<br/>Interpose at the difficult minute, snatch Saul the mistake,<br/>Saul the failure, the ruin he seems now,--and bid him awake<br/>From the dream, the probation, the prelude, to find himself set<br/>Clear and safe in new light and new life,--a new harmony yet<br/>To be run and continued, and ended--who knows?--or endure!<br/>The man taught enough by life's dream, of the rest to make sure;<br/>By the pain-throb, triumphantly winning intensified bliss,<br/>And the next world's reward and repose, by the struggles in this.<br/><br/>"I believe it! 'Tis Thou, God, that givest, 'tis I who receive;<br/>In the first is the last, in Thy will is my power to believe.<br/>All's one gift: Thou canst grant it, moreover, as prompt to my prayer,<br/>As I breathe out this breath, as I open these arms to the air.<br/>From Thy will stream the worlds, life and nature, Thy dread Sabaoth:<br/>_I_ will?--the mere atoms despise me! Why am I not loath<br/>To look that, even that in the face too? Why is it I dare<br/>Think but lightly of such impuissance? What stops my despair?<br/>This;--'tis not what man Does which exalts him, but what man Would do!<br/>See the King--I would help him, but cannot, the wishes fall through.<br/>Could I wrestle to raise him from sorrow, grow poor to enrich,<br/>To fill up his life, starve my own out, I would--knowing which,<br/>I know that my service is perfect. Oh, speak thro' me now!<br/>Would I suffer for him that I love? So wouldst Thou--so wilt Thou!<br/>So shall crown Thee the topmost, ineffablest, uttermost crown--<br/>And Thy love fill infinitude wholly, nor leave up nor down<br/>One spot for the creature to stand in! It is by no breath,<br/>Turn of eye, wave of hand, that salvation joins issue with death!<br/>As Thy love is discovered almighty, almighty be proved<br/>Thy power, that exists with and for it, of being Beloved!<br/>He who did most, shall bear most; the strongest shall stand the most weak,<br/>'Tis the weakness in strength, that I cry for! my flesh, that I seek<br/>In the Godhead! I seek and I find it, O Saul, it shall be<br/>A Face like my face that receives thee: a Man like to me,<br/>Thou shalt love and be loved by, forever: a Hand like this hand<br/>Shall throw open the gates of new life to thee! See the Christ stand!"<br/><br/>I know not too well how I found my way home in the night.<br/>There were witnesses, cohorts about me, to left and to right,<br/>Angels, powers, the unuttered, unseen, the alive, the aware:<br/>I repressed, I got thro' them as hardly, as stragglingly there,<br/>As a runner beset by the populace famished for news--<br/>Life or death. The whole earth was awakened, hell loosed with her crews;<br/>And the stars of night beat with emotion, and tingled and shot<br/>Out in fire the strong pain of pent knowledge: but I fainted not,<br/>For the Hand still impelled me at once and supported, suppressed<br/>All the tumult, and quenched it with quiet, and holy behest,<br/>Till the rapture was shut in itself, and the earth sank to rest.<br/>Anon at the dawn, all that trouble had withered from earth--<br/>Not so much, but I saw it die out in the day's tender birth;<br/>In the gathered intensity brought to the gray of the hills;<br/>In the shuddering forests' held breath; in the sudden wind-thrills;<br/>In the startled wild beasts that bore off, each with eye sidling still<br/>Though averted with wonder and dread; in the birds stiff and chill<br/>That rose heavily, as I approached them, made stupid with awe:<br/>E'en the serpent that slid away silent--he felt the new law.<br/>The same stared in the white humid faces upturned by the flowers;<br/>The same worked in the heart of the cedar and moved the vine-bowers;<br/>And the little brooks witnessing murmured, persistent and low.<br/>With their obstinate, all but hushed voices--"E'en so, it is so!"
