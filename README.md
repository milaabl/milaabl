<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Manor Farm by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    THE rock-like mud unfroze a little and rills<br/>Ran and sparkled down each side of the road<br/>Under the catkins wagging in the hedge.<br/>But earth would have her sleep out, spite of the sun;<br/>Nor did I value that thin gilding beam<br/>More than a pretty February thing<br/>Till I came down to the old Manor Farm,<br/>And church and yew-tree opposite, in age<br/>Its equals and in size. The church and yew<br/>And farmhouse slept in a Sunday silentness.<br/>The air raised not a straw. The steep farm roof,<br/>With tiles duskily glowing, entertained<br/>The mid-day sun; and up and down the roof<br/>White pigeons nestled. There was no sound but one.<br/>Three cart-horses were looking over a gate<br/>Drowsily through their forelocks, swishing their tails<br/>Against a fly, a solitary fly.<br/><br/>The Winter's cheek flushed as if he had drained<br/>Spring, Summer, and Autumn at a draught<br/>And smiled quietly. But 'twas not Winter--<br/>Rather a season of bliss unchangeable<br/>Awakened from farm and church where it had lain<br/>Safe under tile and thatch for ages since<br/>This England, Old already, was called Merry.
</p>
