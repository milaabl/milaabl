# üíÆ TO A CHILD by *Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*

<p>
    Dear child! how radiant on thy mother's knee,<br/>With merry-making eyes and jocund smiles,<br/>Thou gazest at the painted tiles,<br/>Whose figures grace,<br/>With many a grotesque form and face.<br/>The ancient chimney of thy nursery!<br/>The lady with the gay macaw,<br/>The dancing girl, the grave bashaw<br/>With bearded lip and chin;<br/>And, leaning idly o'er his gate,<br/>Beneath the imperial fan of state,<br/>The Chinese mandarin.<br/><br/>With what a look of proud command<br/>Thou shakest in thy little hand<br/>The coral rattle with its silver bells,<br/>Making a merry tune!<br/>Thousands of years in Indian seas<br/>That coral grew, by slow degrees,<br/>Until some deadly and wild monsoon<br/>Dashed it on Coromandel's sand!<br/>Those silver bells<br/>Reposed of yore,<br/>As shapeless ore,<br/>Far down in the deep-sunken wells<br/>Of darksome mines,<br/>In some obscure and sunless place,<br/>Beneath huge Chimborazo's base,<br/>Or Potosi's o'erhanging pines<br/>And thus for thee, O little child,<br/>Through many a danger and escape,<br/>The tall ships passed the stormy cape;<br/>For thee in foreign lands remote,<br/>Beneath a burning, tropic clime,<br/>The Indian peasant, chasing the wild goat,<br/>Himself as swift and wild,<br/>In falling, clutched the frail arbute,<br/>The fibres of whose shallow root,<br/>Uplifted from the soil, betrayed<br/>The silver veins beneath it laid,<br/>The buried treasures of the miser, Time.<br/><br/>But, lo! thy door is left ajar!<br/>Thou hearest footsteps from afar!<br/>And, at the sound,<br/>Thou turnest round<br/>With quick and questioning eyes,<br/>Like one, who, in a foreign land,<br/>Beholds on every hand<br/>Some source of wonder and surprise!<br/>And, restlessly, impatiently,<br/>Thou strivest, strugglest, to be free,<br/>The four walls of thy nursery<br/>Are now like prison walls to thee.<br/>No more thy mother's smiles,<br/>No more the painted tiles,<br/>Delight thee, nor the playthings on the floor,<br/>That won thy little, beating heart before;<br/>Thou strugglest for the open door.<br/><br/>Through these once solitary halls<br/>Thy pattering footstep falls.<br/>The sound of thy merry voice<br/>Makes the old walls<br/>Jubilant, and they rejoice<br/>With the joy of thy young heart,<br/>O'er the light of whose gladness<br/>No shadows of sadness<br/>From the sombre background of memory start.<br/><br/>Once, ah, once, within these walls,<br/>One whom memory oft recalls,<br/>The Father of his Country, dwelt.<br/>And yonder meadows broad and damp<br/>The fires of the besieging camp<br/>Encircled with a burning belt.<br/>Up and down these echoing stairs,<br/>Heavy with the weight of cares,<br/>Sounded his majestic tread;<br/>Yes, within this very room<br/>Sat he in those hours of gloom,<br/>Weary both in heart and head.<br/><br/>But what are these grave thoughts to thee?<br/>Out, out! into the open air!<br/>Thy only dream is liberty,<br/>Thou carest little how or where.<br/>I see thee eager at thy play,<br/>Now shouting to the apples on the tree,<br/>With cheeks as round and red as they;<br/>And now among the yellow stalks,<br/>Among the flowering shrubs and plants,<br/>As restless as the bee.<br/>Along the garden walks,<br/>The tracks of thy small carriage-wheels I trace;<br/>And see at every turn how they efface<br/>Whole villages of sand-roofed tents,<br/>That rise like golden domes<br/>Above the cavernous and secret homes<br/>Of wandering and nomadic tribes of ants.<br/>Ah, cruel little Tamerlane,<br/>Who, with thy dreadful reign,<br/>Dost persecute and overwhelm<br/>These hapless Troglodytes of thy realm!<br/>What! tired already! with those suppliant looks,<br/>And voice more beautiful than a poet's books,<br/>Or murmuring sound of water as it flows.<br/>Thou comest back to parley with repose;<br/>This rustic seat in the old apple-tree,<br/>With its o'erhanging golden canopy<br/>Of leaves illuminate with autumnal hues,<br/>And shining with the argent light of dews,<br/>Shall for a season be our place of rest.<br/>Beneath us, like an oriole's pendent nest,<br/>From which the laughing birds have taken wing,<br/>By thee abandoned, hangs thy vacant swing.<br/>Dream-like the waters of the river gleam;<br/>A sailless vessel drops adown the stream,<br/>And like it, to a sea as wide and deep,<br/>Thou driftest gently down the tides of sleep.<br/><br/>O child! O new-born denizen<br/>Of life's great city! on thy head<br/>The glory of the morn is shed,<br/>Like a celestial benison!<br/>Here at the portal thou dost stand,<br/>And with thy little hand<br/>Thou openest the mysterious gate<br/>Into the future's undiscovered land.<br/>I see its valves expand,<br/>As at the touch of Fate!<br/>Into those realms of love and hate,<br/>Into that darkness blank and drear,<br/>By some prophetic feeling taught,<br/>I launch the bold, adventurous thought,<br/>Freighted with hope and fear;<br/>As upon subterranean streams,<br/>In caverns unexplored and dark,<br/>Men sometimes launch a fragile bark,<br/>Laden with flickering fire,<br/>And watch its swift-receding beams,<br/>Until at length they disappear,<br/>And in the distant dark expire.<br/><br/>By what astrology of fear or hope<br/>Dare I to cast thy horoscope!<br/>Like the new moon thy life appears;<br/>A little strip of silver light,<br/>And widening outward into night<br/>The shadowy disk of future years;<br/>And yet upon its outer rim,<br/>A luminous circle, faint and dim,<br/>And scarcely visible to us here,<br/>Rounds and completes the perfect sphere;<br/>A prophecy and intimation,<br/>A pale and feeble adumbration,<br/>Of the great world of light, that lies<br/>Behind all human destinies.<br/><br/>Ah! if thy fate, with anguish fraught,<br/>Should be to wet the dusty soil<br/>With the hot tears and sweat of toil,--<br/>To struggle with imperious thought,<br/>Until the overburdened brain,<br/>Weary with labor, faint with pain,<br/>Like a jarred pendulum, retain<br/>Only its motion, not its power,--<br/>Remember, in that perilous hour,<br/>When most afflicted and oppressed,<br/>From labor there shall come forth rest.<br/><br/>And if a more auspicious fate<br/>On thy advancing steps await<br/>Still let it ever be thy pride<br/>To linger by the laborer's side;<br/>With words of sympathy or song<br/>To cheer the dreary march along<br/>Of the great army of the poor,<br/>O'er desert sand, o'er dangerous moor.<br/>Nor to thyself the task shall be<br/>Without reward; for thou shalt learn<br/>The wisdom early to discern<br/>True beauty in utility;<br/>As great Pythagoras of yore,<br/>Standing beside the blacksmith's door,<br/>And hearing the hammers, as they smote<br/>The anvils with a different note,<br/>Stole from the varying tones, that hung<br/>Vibrant on every iron tongue,<br/>The secret of the sounding wire.<br/>And formed the seven-chorded lyre.<br/><br/>Enough! I will not play the Seer;<br/>I will no longer strive to ope<br/>The mystic volume, where appear<br/>The herald Hope, forerunning Fear,<br/>And Fear, the pursuivant of Hope.<br/>Thy destiny remains untold;<br/>For, like Acestes' shaft of old,<br/>The swift thought kindles as it flies,<br/>And burns to ashes in the skies.
