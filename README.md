# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Sompnour's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>The Sompnour in his stirrups high he stood,<br/>Upon this Friar his hearte was so wood,<br/>That like an aspen leaf he quoke for ire:<br/>"Lordings," quoth he, "but one thing I desire;<br/>I you beseech, that of your courtesy,<br/>Since ye have heard this false Friar lie,<br/>As suffer me I may my tale tell<br/>This Friar boasteth that he knoweth hell,<br/>And, God it wot, that is but little wonder,<br/>Friars and fiends be but little asunder.<br/>For, pardie, ye have often time heard tell,<br/>How that a friar ravish'd was to hell<br/>In spirit ones by a visioun,<br/>And, as an angel led him up and down,<br/>To shew him all the paines that there were,<br/>In all the place saw he not a frere;<br/>Of other folk he saw enough in woe.<br/>Unto the angel spake the friar tho;<br/>'Now, Sir,' quoth he, 'have friars such a grace,<br/>That none of them shall come into this place?'<br/>'Yes' quoth the angel; 'many a millioun:'<br/>And unto Satanas he led him down.<br/>'And now hath Satanas,' said he, 'a tail<br/>Broader than of a carrack is the sail.<br/>Hold up thy tail, thou Satanas,' quoth he,<br/>'Shew forth thine erse, and let the friar see<br/>Where is the nest of friars in this place.'<br/>And less than half a furlong way of space<br/>Right so as bees swarmen out of a hive,<br/>Out of the devil's erse there gan to drive<br/>A twenty thousand friars on a rout.<br/>And throughout hell they swarmed all about,<br/>And came again, as fast as they may gon,<br/>And in his erse they creeped every one:<br/>He clapt his tail again, and lay full still.<br/>This friar, when he looked had his fill<br/>Upon the torments of that sorry place,<br/>His spirit God restored of his grace<br/>Into his body again, and he awoke;<br/>But natheless for feare yet he quoke,<br/>So was the devil's erse aye in his mind;<br/>That is his heritage, of very kind<br/>God save you alle, save this cursed Frere;<br/>My prologue will I end in this mannere.<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>Lordings, there is in Yorkshire, as I guess,<br/>A marshy country called Holderness,<br/>In which there went a limitour about<br/>To preach, and eke to beg, it is no doubt.<br/>And so befell that on a day this frere<br/>Had preached at a church in his mannere,<br/>And specially, above every thing,<br/>Excited he the people in his preaching<br/>To trentals,  and to give, for Godde's sake,<br/>Wherewith men mighte holy houses make,<br/>There as divine service is honour'd,<br/>Not there as it is wasted and devour'd,<br/>Nor where it needeth not for to be given,<br/>As to possessioners,  that may liven,<br/>Thanked be God, in wealth and abundance.<br/>"Trentals," said he, "deliver from penance<br/>Their friendes' soules, as well old as young,<br/>Yea, when that they be hastily y-sung, --<br/>Not for to hold a priest jolly and gay,<br/>He singeth not but one mass in a day.<br/>"Deliver out," quoth he, "anon the souls.<br/>Full hard it is, with flesh-hook or with owls<br/>To be y-clawed, or to burn or bake:<br/>Now speed you hastily, for Christe's sake."<br/>And when this friar had said all his intent,<br/>With qui cum patre forth his way he went,<br/>When folk in church had giv'n him what them lest;<br/>He went his way, no longer would he rest,<br/>With scrip and tipped staff, y-tucked high:<br/>In every house he gan to pore and pry,<br/>And begged meal and cheese, or elles corn.<br/>His fellow had a staff tipped with horn,<br/>A pair of tables all of ivory,<br/>And a pointel y-polish'd fetisly,<br/>And wrote alway the names, as he stood;<br/>Of all the folk that gave them any good,<br/>Askaunce that he woulde for them pray.<br/>"Give us a bushel wheat, or malt, or rey,<br/>A Godde's kichel, or a trip of cheese,<br/>Or elles what you list, we may not chese;<br/>A Godde's halfpenny,  or a mass penny;<br/>Or give us of your brawn, if ye have any;<br/>A dagon of your blanket, leve dame,<br/>Our sister dear, -- lo, here I write your name,--<br/>Bacon or beef, or such thing as ye find."<br/>A sturdy harlot went them aye behind,<br/>That was their hoste's man, and bare a sack,<br/>And what men gave them, laid it on his back<br/>And when that he was out at door, anon<br/>He planed away the names every one,<br/>That he before had written in his tables:<br/>He served them with nifles and with fables. --<br/><br/>"Nay, there thou liest, thou Sompnour," quoth the Frere.<br/>"Peace," quoth our Host, "for Christe's mother dear;<br/>Tell forth thy tale, and spare it not at all."<br/>"So thrive I," quoth this Sompnour, "so I shall." --<br/><br/>So long he went from house to house, till he<br/>Came to a house, where he was wont to be<br/>Refreshed more than in a hundred places<br/>Sick lay the husband man, whose that the place is,<br/>Bed-rid upon a couche low he lay:<br/>"Deus hic," quoth he; "O Thomas friend, good day,"<br/>Said this friar, all courteously and soft.<br/>"Thomas," quoth he, "God yield it you, full oft<br/>Have I upon this bench fared full well,<br/>Here have I eaten many a merry meal."<br/>And from the bench he drove away the cat,<br/>And laid adown his potent and his hat,<br/>And eke his scrip, and sat himself adown:<br/>His fellow was y-walked into town<br/>Forth with his knave, into that hostelry<br/>Where as he shope him that night to lie.<br/><br/>"O deare master," quoth this sicke man,<br/>"How have ye fared since that March began?<br/>I saw you not this fortenight and more."<br/>"God wot," quoth he, "labour'd have I full sore;<br/>And specially for thy salvation<br/>Have I said many a precious orison,<br/>And for mine other friendes, God them bless.<br/>I have this day been at your church at mess,<br/>And said sermon after my simple wit,<br/>Not all after the text of Holy Writ;<br/>For it is hard to you, as I suppose,<br/>And therefore will I teach you aye the glose.<br/>Glosing is a full glorious thing certain,<br/>For letter slayeth, as we clerkes sayn.<br/>There have I taught them to be charitable,<br/>And spend their good where it is reasonable.<br/>And there I saw our dame; where is she?"<br/>"Yonder I trow that in the yard she be,"<br/>Saide this man; "and she will come anon."<br/>"Hey master, welcome be ye by Saint John,"<br/>Saide this wife; "how fare ye heartily?"<br/><br/>This friar riseth up full courteously,<br/>And her embraceth in his armes narrow,<br/>And kiss'th her sweet, and chirketh as a sparrow<br/>With his lippes: "Dame," quoth he, "right well,<br/>As he that is your servant every deal.<br/>Thanked be God, that gave you soul and life,<br/>Yet saw I not this day so fair a wife<br/>In all the churche, God so save me,"<br/>"Yea, God amend defaultes, Sir," quoth she;<br/>"Algates welcome be ye, by my fay."<br/>"Grand mercy, Dame; that have I found alway.<br/>But of your greate goodness, by your leave,<br/>I woulde pray you that ye not you grieve,<br/>I will with Thomas speak a little throw:<br/>These curates be so negligent and slow<br/>To grope tenderly a conscience.<br/>In shrift and preaching is my diligence<br/>And study in Peter's wordes and in Paul's;<br/>I walk and fishe Christian menne's souls,<br/>To yield our Lord Jesus his proper rent;<br/>To spread his word is alle mine intent."<br/>"Now by your faith, O deare Sir," quoth she,<br/>"Chide him right well, for sainte charity.<br/>He is aye angry as is a pismire,<br/>Though that he have all that he can desire,<br/>Though I him wrie at night, and make him warm,<br/>And ov'r him lay my leg and eke mine arm,<br/>He groaneth as our boar that lies in sty:<br/>Other disport of him right none have I,<br/>I may not please him in no manner case."<br/>"O Thomas, je vous dis, Thomas, Thomas,<br/>This maketh the fiend, this must be amended.<br/>Ire is a thing that high God hath defended,<br/>And thereof will I speak a word or two."<br/>"Now, master," quoth the wife, "ere that I go,<br/>What will ye dine? I will go thereabout."<br/>"Now, Dame," quoth he, "je vous dis sans doute,<br/>Had I not of a capon but the liver,<br/>And of your white bread not but a shiver,<br/>And after that a roasted pigge's head,<br/>(But I would that for me no beast were dead,)<br/>Then had I with you homely suffisance.<br/>I am a man of little sustenance.<br/>My spirit hath its fost'ring in the Bible.<br/>My body is aye so ready and penible<br/>To wake, that my stomach is destroy'd.<br/>I pray you, Dame, that ye be not annoy'd,<br/>Though I so friendly you my counsel shew;<br/>By God, I would have told it but to few."<br/>"Now, Sir," quoth she, "but one word ere I go;<br/>My child is dead within these weeke's two,<br/>Soon after that ye went out of this town."<br/><br/>"His death saw I by revelatioun,"<br/>Said this friar, "at home in our dortour.<br/>I dare well say, that less than half an hour<br/>Mter his death, I saw him borne to bliss<br/>In mine vision, so God me wiss.<br/>So did our sexton, and our fermerere,<br/>That have been true friars fifty year, --<br/>They may now, God be thanked of his love,<br/>Make their jubilee, and walk above.<br/>And up I rose, and all our convent eke,<br/>With many a teare trilling on my cheek,<br/>Withoute noise or clattering of bells,<br/>Te Deum was our song, and nothing else,<br/>Save that to Christ I bade an orison,<br/>Thanking him of my revelation.<br/>For, Sir and Dame, truste me right well,<br/>Our orisons be more effectuel,<br/>And more we see of Christe's secret things,<br/>Than borel folk, although that they be kings.<br/>We live in povert', and in abstinence,<br/>And borel folk in riches and dispence<br/>Of meat and drink, and in their foul delight.<br/>We have this worlde's lust all in despight<br/>Lazar and Dives lived diversely,<br/>And diverse guerdon hadde they thereby.<br/>Whoso will pray, he must fast and be clean,<br/>And fat his soul, and keep his body lean<br/>We fare as saith th' apostle; cloth and food<br/>Suffice us, although they be not full good.<br/>The cleanness and the fasting of us freres<br/>Maketh that Christ accepteth our prayeres.<br/>Lo, Moses forty days and forty night<br/>Fasted, ere that the high God full of might<br/>Spake with him in the mountain of Sinai:<br/>With empty womb of fasting many a day<br/>Received he the lawe, that was writ<br/>With Godde's finger; and Eli, well ye wit,<br/>In Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech<br/>With highe God, that is our live's leech,<br/>He fasted long, and was in contemplance.<br/>Aaron, that had the temple in governance,<br/>And eke the other priestes every one,<br/>Into the temple when they shoulde gon<br/>To praye for the people, and do service,<br/>They woulde drinken in no manner wise<br/>No drinke, which that might them drunken make,<br/>But there in abstinence pray and wake,<br/>Lest that they died: take heed what I say --<br/>But they be sober that for the people pray --<br/>Ware that, I say -- no more: for it sufficeth.<br/>Our Lord Jesus, as Holy Writ deviseth,<br/>Gave us example of fasting and prayeres:<br/>Therefore we mendicants, we sely freres,<br/>Be wedded to povert' and continence,<br/>To charity, humbless, and abstinence,<br/>To persecution for righteousness,<br/>To weeping, misericorde, and to cleanness.<br/>And therefore may ye see that our prayeres<br/>(I speak of us, we mendicants, we freres),<br/>Be to the highe God more acceptable<br/>Than youres, with your feastes at your table.<br/>From Paradise first, if I shall not lie,<br/>Was man out chased for his gluttony,<br/>And chaste was man in Paradise certain.<br/>But hark now, Thomas, what I shall thee sayn;<br/>I have no text of it, as I suppose,<br/>But I shall find it in a manner glose;<br/>That specially our sweet Lord Jesus<br/>Spake this of friars, when he saide thus,<br/>'Blessed be they that poor in spirit be'<br/>And so forth all the gospel may ye see,<br/>Whether it be liker our profession,<br/>Or theirs that swimmen in possession;<br/>Fy on their pomp, and on their gluttony,<br/>And on their lewedness!  I them defy.<br/>Me thinketh they be like Jovinian,<br/>Fat as a whale, and walking as a swan;<br/>All vinolent as bottle in the spence;<br/>Their prayer is of full great reverence;<br/>When they for soules say the Psalm of David,<br/>Lo, 'Buf' they say, Cor meum eructavit.<br/>Who follow Christe's gospel and his lore<br/>But we, that humble be, and chaste, and pore,<br/>Workers of Godde's word, not auditours?<br/>Therefore right as a hawk upon a sours<br/>Up springs into the air, right so prayeres<br/>Of charitable and chaste busy freres<br/>Make their sours to Godde's eares two.<br/>Thomas, Thomas, so may I ride or go,<br/>And by that lord that called is Saint Ive,<br/>N'ere thou our brother, shouldest thou not thrive;<br/>In our chapiter pray we day and night<br/>To Christ, that he thee sende health and might,<br/>Thy body for to wielde hastily.<br/><br/>"God wot," quoth he, "nothing thereof feel I;<br/>So help me Christ, as I in fewe years<br/>Have spended upon divers manner freres<br/>Full many a pound, yet fare I ne'er the bet;<br/>Certain my good have I almost beset:<br/>Farewell my gold, for it is all ago."<br/>The friar answer'd, "O Thomas, dost thou so?<br/>What needest thou diverse friars to seech?<br/>What needeth him that hath a perfect leech,<br/>To seeken other leeches in the town?<br/>Your inconstance is your confusioun.<br/>Hold ye then me, or elles our convent,<br/>To praye for you insufficient?<br/>Thomas, that jape it is not worth a mite;<br/>Your malady is for we have too lite.<br/>Ah, give that convent half a quarter oats;<br/>And give that convent four and twenty groats;<br/>And give that friar a penny, and let him go!<br/>Nay, nay, Thomas, it may no thing be so.<br/>What is a farthing worth parted on twelve?<br/>Lo, each thing that is oned in himselve<br/>Is more strong than when it is y-scatter'd.<br/>Thomas, of me thou shalt not be y-flatter'd,<br/>Thou wouldest have our labour all for nought.<br/>The highe God, that all this world hath wrought,<br/>Saith, that the workman worthy is his hire<br/>Thomas, nought of your treasure I desire<br/>As for myself, but that all our convent<br/>To pray for you is aye so diligent:<br/>And for to builde Christe's owen church.<br/>Thomas, if ye will learne for to wirch,<br/>Of building up of churches may ye find<br/>If it be good, in Thomas' life of Ind.<br/>Ye lie here full of anger and of ire,<br/>With which the devil sets your heart on fire,<br/>And chide here this holy innocent<br/>Your wife, that is so meek and patient.<br/>And therefore trow me, Thomas, if thee lest,<br/>Ne strive not with thy wife, as for the best.<br/>And bear this word away now, by thy faith,<br/>Touching such thing, lo, what the wise man saith:<br/>'Within thy house be thou no lion;<br/>To thy subjects do none oppression;<br/>Nor make thou thine acquaintance for to flee.'<br/>And yet, Thomas, eftsoones charge I thee,<br/>Beware from ire that in thy bosom sleeps,<br/>Ware from the serpent, that so slily creeps<br/>Under the grass, and stingeth subtilly.<br/>Beware, my son, and hearken patiently,<br/>That twenty thousand men have lost their lives<br/>For striving with their lemans and their wives.<br/>Now since ye have so holy and meek a wife,<br/>What needeth you, Thomas, to make strife?<br/>There is, y-wis, no serpent so cruel,<br/>When men tread on his tail nor half so fell,<br/>As woman is, when she hath caught an ire;<br/>Very vengeance is then all her desire.<br/>Ire is a sin, one of the greate seven,<br/>Abominable to the God of heaven,<br/>And to himself it is destruction.<br/>This every lewed vicar and parson<br/>Can say, how ire engenders homicide;<br/>Ire is in sooth th' executor of pride.<br/>I could of ire you say so muche sorrow,<br/>My tale shoulde last until to-morrow.<br/>And therefore pray I God both day and ight,<br/>An irous man God send him little might.<br/>It is great harm, and certes great pity<br/>To set an irous man in high degree.<br/><br/>"Whilom there was an irous potestate,<br/>As saith Senec, that during his estate<br/>Upon a day out rode knightes two;<br/>And, as fortune would that it were so,<br/>The one of them came home, the other not.<br/>Anon the knight before the judge is brought,<br/>That saide thus; 'Thou hast thy fellow slain,<br/>For which I doom thee to the death certain.'<br/>And to another knight commanded he;<br/>'Go, lead him to the death, I charge thee.'<br/>And happened, as they went by the way<br/>Toward the place where as he should dey,<br/>The knight came, which men weened had been dead<br/>Then thoughte they it was the beste rede<br/>To lead them both unto the judge again.<br/>They saide, 'Lord, the knight hath not y-slain<br/>His fellow;

Friar John, what manner world is this?<br/>I see well that there something is amiss;<br/>Ye look as though the wood were full of thieves.<br/>Sit down anon, and tell me what your grieve is,<br/>And it shall be amended, if I may."<br/>"I have," quoth he, "had a despite to-day,<br/>God yielde you, adown in your village,<br/>That in this world is none so poor a page,<br/>That would not have abominatioun<br/>Of that I have received in your town:<br/>And yet ne grieveth me nothing so sore,<br/>As that the olde churl, with lockes hoar,<br/>Blasphemed hath our holy convent eke."<br/>"Now, master," quoth this lord, "I you beseek" --<br/>"No master, Sir," quoth he, "but servitour,<br/>Though I have had in schoole that honour.<br/>God liketh not, that men us Rabbi call<br/>Neither in market, nor in your large hall."<br/>"No force," quoth he; "but tell me all your grief."<br/>Sir," quoth this friar, "an odious mischief<br/>This day betid is to mine order and me,<br/>And so par consequence to each degree<br/>Of holy churche, God amend it soon."<br/>"Sir," quoth the lord, "ye know what is to doon:<br/>Distemp'r you not, ye be my confessour.<br/>Ye be the salt of th' earth, and the savour;<br/>For Godde's love your patience now hold;<br/>Tell me your grief." And he anon him told<br/>As ye have heard before, ye know well what.<br/>The lady of the house aye stiller sat,<br/>Till she had hearde what the friar said,<br/>"Hey, Godde's mother;" quoth she, "blissful maid,<br/>Is there ought elles? tell me faithfully."<br/>"Madame," quoth he, "how thinketh you thereby?"<br/>"How thinketh me?" quoth she; "so God me speed,<br/>I say, a churl hath done a churlish deed,<br/>What should I say? God let him never the;<br/>His sicke head is full of vanity;<br/>I hold him in a manner phrenesy."<br/>"Madame," quoth he, "by God, I shall not lie,<br/>But I in other wise may be awreke,<br/>I shall defame him ov'r all there I speak;<br/>This false blasphemour, that charged me<br/>To parte that will not departed be,<br/>To every man alike, with mischance."<br/><br/>The lord sat still, as he were in a trance,<br/>And in his heart he rolled up and down,<br/>"How had this churl imaginatioun<br/>To shewe such a problem to the frere.<br/>Never ere now heard I of such mattere;<br/>I trow the Devil put it in his mind.<br/>In all arsmetrik shall there no man find,<br/>Before this day, of such a question.<br/>Who shoulde make a demonstration,<br/>That every man should have alike his part<br/>As of the sound and savour of a fart?<br/>O nice proude churl, I shrew his face.<br/>Lo, Sires," quoth the lord, "with harde grace,<br/>Who ever heard of such a thing ere now?<br/>To every man alike? tell me how.<br/>It is impossible, it may not be.<br/>Hey nice churl, God let him never the.<br/>The rumbling of a fart, and every soun',<br/>Is but of air reverberatioun,<br/>And ever wasteth lite and lite away;<br/>There is no man can deemen, by my fay,<br/>If that it were departed equally.<br/>What? lo, my churl, lo yet how shrewedly<br/>Unto my confessour to-day he spake;<br/>I hold him certain a demoniac.<br/>Now eat your meat, and let the churl go play,<br/>Let him go hang himself a devil way!"<br/><br/>Now stood the lorde's squier at the board,<br/>That carv'd his meat, and hearde word by word<br/>Of all this thing, which that I have you said.<br/>"My lord," quoth he, "be ye not evil paid,<br/>I coulde telle, for a gowne-cloth,<br/>To you, Sir Friar, so that ye be not wrot,<br/>How that this fart should even dealed be<br/>Among your convent, if it liked thee."<br/>"Tell," quoth the lord, "and thou shalt have anon<br/>A gowne-cloth, by God and by Saint John."<br/>"My lord," quoth he, "when that the weather is fair,<br/>Withoute wind, or perturbing of air,<br/>Let bring a cart-wheel here into this hall,<br/>But looke that it have its spokes all;<br/>Twelve spokes hath a cart-wheel commonly;<br/>And bring me then twelve friars, know ye why?<br/>For thirteen is a convent as I guess;<br/>Your confessor here, for his worthiness,<br/>Shall perform up the number of his convent.<br/>Then shall they kneel adown by one assent,<br/>And to each spoke's end, in this mannere,<br/>Full sadly lay his nose shall a frere;<br/>Your noble confessor there, God him save,<br/>Shall hold his nose upright under the nave.<br/>Then shall this churl, with belly stiff and tought<br/>As any tabour, hither be y-brought;<br/>And set him on the wheel right of this cart<br/>Upon the nave, and make him let a fart,<br/>And ye shall see, on peril of my life,<br/>By very proof that is demonstrative,<br/>That equally the sound of it will wend,<br/>And eke the stink, unto the spokes' end,<br/>Save that this worthy man, your confessour'<br/>(Because he is a man of great honour),<br/>Shall have the firste fruit, as reason is;<br/>The noble usage of friars yet it is,<br/>The worthy men of them shall first be served,<br/>And certainly he hath it well deserved;<br/>He hath to-day taught us so muche good<br/>With preaching in the pulpit where he stood,<br/>That I may vouchesafe, I say for me,<br/>He had the firste smell of fartes three;<br/>And so would all his brethren hardily;<br/>He beareth him so fair and holily."<br/><br/>The lord, the lady, and each man, save the frere,<br/>Saide, that Jankin spake in this mattere<br/>As well as Euclid, or as Ptolemy.<br/>Touching the churl, they said that subtilty<br/>And high wit made him speaken as he spake;<br/>He is no fool, nor no demoniac.<br/>And Jankin hath y-won a newe gown;<br/>My tale is done, we are almost at town.
