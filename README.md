  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To Edward Noel Long, Esq by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
      "Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico."--HORACE.<br/><br/>Dear LONG, in this sequester'd scene,<br/>  While all around in slumber lie,<br/>The joyous days, which ours have been<br/>  Come rolling fresh on Fancy's eye;<br/>Thus, if, amidst the gathering storm,<br/>While clouds the darken'd noon deform,<br/>Yon heaven assumes a varied glow,<br/>I hail the sky's celestial bow,<br/>Which spreads the sign of future peace,<br/>And bids the war of tempests cease.<br/>Ah! though the present brings but pain,<br/>I think those days may come again;<br/>Or if, in melancholy mood,<br/>Some lurking envious fear intrude,<br/>To check my bosom's fondest thought,<br/>  And interrupt the golden dream,<br/>I crush the fiend with malice fraught,<br/>  And, still, indulge my wonted theme.<br/>Although we ne'er again can trace,<br/>  In Granta's vale, the pedant's lore,<br/>Nor through the groves of Ida chase<br/>  Our raptured visions, as before;<br/>Though Youth has flown on rosy pinion,<br/>And Manhood claims his stern dominion,<br/>Age will not every hope destroy,<br/>But yield some hours of sober joy.<br/><br/>  Yes, I will hope that Time's broad wing<br/>Will shed around some dews of spring:<br/>But, if his scythe must sweep the flowers<br/>Which bloom among the fairy bowers,<br/>Where smiling Youth delights to dwell,<br/>And hearts with early rapture swell;<br/>If frowning Age, with cold controul,<br/>Confines the current of the soul,<br/>Congeals the tear of Pity's eye,<br/>Or checks the sympathetic sigh,<br/>Or hears, unmov'd, Misfortune's groan<br/>And bids me feel for self alone;<br/>Oh! may my bosom never learn<br/>  To soothe its wonted heedless flow;<br/>Still, still, despise the censor stern,<br/>  But ne'er forget another's woe.<br/>Yes, as you knew me in the days,<br/>  O'er which Remembrance yet delays,<br/>Still may I rove untutor'd, wild,<br/>  And even in age, at heart a child.<br/><br/>Though, now, on airy visions borne,<br/>  To you my soul is still the same.<br/>Oft has it been my fate to mourn,<br/>  And all my former joys are tame:<br/>But, hence! ye hours of sable hue!<br/>  Your frowns are gone, my sorrows o'er:<br/>By every bliss my childhood knew,<br/>  I'll think upon your shade no more.<br/>Thus, when the whirlwind's rage is past,<br/>  And caves their sullen roar enclose<br/>We heed no more the wintry blast,<br/>  When lull'd by zephyr to repose.<br/>Full often has my infant Muse,<br/>  Attun'd to love her languid lyre;<br/>But, now, without a theme to choose,<br/>  The strains in stolen sighs expire.<br/>My youthful nymphs, alas! are flown;<br/>  E----is a wife, and C----a mother,<br/>And Carolina sighs alone,<br/>  And Mary's given to another;<br/>And Cora's eye, which roll'd on me,<br/>  Can now no more my love recall--<br/>In truth, dear LONG, 'twas time to flee-<br/>  For Cora's eye will shine on all.<br/>And though the Sun, with genial rays,<br/>His beams alike to all displays,<br/>And every lady's eye's a _sun_,<br/>These last should be confin'd to one.<br/>The soul's meridian don't become her,<br/>Whose Sun displays a general _summer_!<br/>Thus faint is every former flame,<br/>And Passion's self is now a name;<br/>As, when the ebbing flames are low,<br/>  The aid which once improv'd their light,<br/>And bade them burn with fiercer glow,<br/>  Now quenches all their sparks in night;<br/>Thus has it been with Passion's fires,<br/>  As many a boy and girl remembers,<br/>While all the force of love expires,<br/>  Extinguish'd with the dying embers.<br/><br/>  But now, dear LONG, 'tis midnight's noon,<br/>And clouds obscure the watery moon,<br/>Whose beauties I shall not rehearse,<br/>Describ'd in every stripling's verse;<br/>For why should I the path go o'er<br/>Which every bard has trod before?<br/>Yet ere yon silver lamp of night<br/>  Has thrice perform'd her stated round,<br/>Has thrice retrac'd her path of light,<br/>  And chas'd away the gloom profound,<br/>I trust, that we, my gentle Friend,<br/>Shall see her rolling orbit wend,<br/>Above the dear-lov'd peaceful seat,<br/>Which once contain'd our youth's retreat;<br/>And, then, with those our childhood knew,<br/>We'll mingle in the festive crew;<br/>While many a tale of former day<br/>Shall wing the laughing hours away;<br/>And all the flow of souls shall pour<br/>The sacred intellectual shower,<br/>Nor cease, till Luna's waning horn,<br/>Scarce glimmers through the mist of Morn.
</p>
