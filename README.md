<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Buried Life by *Matthew Arnold*

<p>
    Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,<br/>Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!<br/>I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.<br/>Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,<br/>We know, we know that we can smile!<br/>But there's a something in this breast,<br/>To which thy light words bring no rest,<br/>And thy gay smiles no anodyne.<br/>Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,<br/>And turn those limpid eyes on mine,<br/>And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.<br/><br/>Alas! is even love too weak<br/>To unlock the heart, and let it speak?<br/>Are even lovers powerless to reveal<br/>To one another what indeed they feel?<br/>I knew the mass of men conceal'd<br/>Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd<br/>They would by other men be met<br/>With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;<br/>I knew they lived and moved<br/>Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest<br/>Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet<br/>The same heart beats in every human breast!<br/><br/>But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb<br/>Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?<br/><br/>Ah! well for us, if even we,<br/>Even for a moment, can get free<br/>Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;<br/>For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!<br/><br/>Fate, which foresaw<br/>How frivolous a baby man would be--<br/>By what distractions he would be possess'd,<br/>How he would pour himself in every strife,<br/>And well-nigh change his own identity--<br/>That it might keep from his capricious play<br/>His genuine self, and force him to obey<br/>Even in his own despite his being's law,<br/>Bade through the deep recesses of our breast<br/>The unregarded river of our life<br/>Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;<br/>And that we should not see<br/>The buried stream, and seem to be<br/>Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,<br/>Though driving on with it eternally.<br/><br/>But often, in the world's most crowded streets,<br/>But often, in the din of strife,<br/>There rises an unspeakable desire<br/>After the knowledge of our buried life;<br/>A thirst to spend our fire and restless force<br/>In tracking out our true, original course;<br/>A longing to inquire<br/>Into the mystery of this heart which beats<br/>So wild, so deep in us--to know<br/>Whence our lives come and where they go.<br/>And many a man in his own breast then delves,<br/>But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.<br/>And we have been on many thousand lines,<br/>And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;<br/>But hardly have we, for one little hour,<br/>Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--<br/>Hardly had skill to utter one of all<br/>The nameless feelings that course through our breast,<br/>But they course on for ever unexpress'd.<br/>And long we try in vain to speak and act<br/>Our hidden self, and what we say and do<br/>Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!<br/>And then we will no more be rack'd<br/>With inward striving, and demand<br/>Of all the thousand nothings of the hour<br/>Their stupefying power;<br/>Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!<br/>Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,<br/>From the soul's subterranean depth upborne<br/>As from an infinitely distant land,<br/>Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey<br/>A melancholy into all our day.<br/>Only--but this is rare--<br/>When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,<br/>When, jaded with the rush and glare<br/>Of the interminable hours,<br/>Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,<br/>When our world-deafen'd ear<br/>Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--<br/>A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,<br/>And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.<br/>The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,<br/>And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.<br/>A man becomes aware of his life's flow,<br/>And hears its winding murmur; and he sees<br/>The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.<br/><br/>And there arrives a lull in the hot race<br/>Wherein he doth for ever chase<br/>That flying and elusive shadow, rest.<br/>An air of coolness plays upon his face,<br/>And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.<br/>And then he thinks he knows<br/>The hills where his life rose,<br/>And the sea where it goes.
