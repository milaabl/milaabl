# üíÆ Cain: A Mystery by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    ACT I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_The Land without Paradise.--Time, Sunrise_.<br/><br/>   ADAM, EVE, CAIN, ABEL, ADAH, ZILLAH, _offering a Sacrifice_.<br/><br/>_Adam_. God, the Eternal! Infinite! All-wise!--<br/>Who out of darkness on the deep didst make<br/>Light on the waters with a word--All Hail!<br/>Jehovah! with returning light--All Hail!<br/><br/>_Eve_. God! who didst name the day, and separate<br/>Morning from night, till then divided never--<br/>Who didst divide the wave from wave, and call<br/>Part of thy work the firmament--All Hail!<br/><br/>_Abel_. God! who didst call the elements into<br/>Earth, ocean, air and fire--and with the day<br/>And night, and worlds which these illuminate,<br/>Or shadow, madest beings to enjoy them,<br/>And love both them and thee--All Hail! All Hail!<br/><br/>_Adah_. God! the Eternal parent of all things!<br/>Who didst create these best and beauteous beings,<br/>To be belov√©d, more than all, save thee--<br/>Let me love thee and them:--All Hail! All Hail!<br/><br/>_Zillah_. Oh, God! who loving, making, blessing all,<br/>Yet didst permit the Serpent to creep in,<br/>And drive my father forth from Paradise,<br/>Keep us from further evil:--Hail! All Hail!<br/><br/>_Adam_. Son Cain! my first-born--wherefore art thou silent?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Why should I speak?<br/><br/>_Adam_.                     To pray.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                             Have ye not prayed?<br/><br/>_Adam_. We have, most fervently.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                           And loudly: I<br/>Have heard you.<br/><br/>_Adam_.         So will God, I trust.<br/><br/>_Abel_.                              Amen!<br/><br/>_Adam_. But thou my eldest born? art silent still?<br/><br/>_Cain_. 'Tis better I should be so.<br/><br/>_Adam_.                              Wherefore so?<br/><br/>_Cain_. I have nought to ask.<br/><br/>_Adam_.                        Nor aught to thank for?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                               No.<br/><br/>_Adam_. Dost thou not _live_?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       Must I not die?<br/><br/>_Eve_.                                          Alas!<br/>The fruit of our forbidden tree begins<br/>To fall.<br/><br/>_Adam_. And we must gather it again.<br/>Oh God! why didst thou plant the tree of knowledge?<br/><br/>_Cain_. And wherefore plucked ye not the tree of life?<br/>Ye might have then defied him.<br/><br/>_Adam_.                        Oh! my son,<br/>Blaspheme not: these are Serpent's words.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                   Why not?<br/>The snake spoke _truth_; it _was_ the Tree of Knowledge;<br/>It _was_ the Tree of Life: knowledge is good,<br/>And Life is good; and how can both be evil?<br/><br/>_Eve_. My boy! thou speakest as I spoke in sin,<br/>Before thy birth: let me not see renewed<br/>My misery in thine. I have repented.<br/>Let me not see my offspring fall into<br/>The snares beyond the walls of Paradise,<br/>Which even in Paradise destroyed his parents.<br/>Content thee with what _is_. Had we been so,<br/>Thou now hadst been contented.--Oh, my son!<br/><br/>_Adam_. Our orisons completed, let us hence,<br/>Each to his task of toil--not heavy, though<br/>Needful: the earth is young, and yields us kindly<br/>Her fruits with little labour.<br/><br/>_Eve_.                         Cain--my son--<br/>Behold thy father cheerful and resigned--<br/>And do as he doth.                           [_Exeunt_ ADAM _and_ EVE.<br/><br/>_Zillah_.          Wilt thou not, my brother?<br/><br/>_Abel_. Why wilt thou wear this gloom upon thy brow,<br/>Which can avail thee nothing, save to rouse<br/>The Eternal anger?<br/><br/>_Adah_.             My belov√©d Cain<br/>Wilt thou frown even on me?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      No, Adah! no;<br/>I fain would be alone a little while.<br/>Abel, I'm sick at heart; but it will pass;<br/>Precede me, brother--I will follow shortly.<br/>And you, too, sisters, tarry not behind;<br/>Your gentleness must not be harshly met:<br/>I'll follow you anon.<br/><br/>_Adah_.               If not, I will<br/>Return to seek you here.<br/><br/>_Abel_.                   The peace of God<br/>Be on your spirit, brother!<br/>                                   [_Exeunt_ ABEL, ZILLAH, _and_ ADAH.<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_solus_).           And this is<br/>Life?--Toil! and wherefore should I toil?--because<br/>My father could not keep his place in Eden?<br/>What had _I_ done in this?--I was unborn:<br/>I sought not to be born; nor love the state<br/>To which that birth has brought me. Why did he<br/>Yield to the Serpent and the woman? or<br/>Yielding--why suffer? What was there in this?<br/>The tree was planted, and why not for him?<br/>If not, why place him near it, where it grew<br/>The fairest in the centre? They have but<br/>One answer to all questions, "'Twas _his_ will,<br/>And _he_ is good." How know I that? Because<br/>He is all-powerful, must all-good, too, follow?<br/>I judge but by the fruits--and they are bitter--<br/>Which I must feed on for a fault not mine.<br/>Whom have we here?--A shape like to the angels<br/>Yet of a sterner and a sadder aspect<br/>Of spiritual essence: why do I quake?<br/>Why should I fear him more than other spirits,<br/>Whom I see daily wave their fiery swords<br/>Before the gates round which I linger oft,<br/>In Twilight's hour, to catch a glimpse of those<br/>Gardens which are my just inheritance,<br/>Ere the night closes o'er the inhibited walls<br/>And the immortal trees which overtop<br/>The Cherubim-defended battlements?<br/>If I shrink not from these, the fire-armed angels,<br/>Why should I quail from him who now approaches?<br/>Yet--he seems mightier far than them, nor less<br/>Beauteous, and yet not all as beautiful<br/>As he hath been, and might be: sorrow seems<br/>Half of his immortality. And is it<br/>So? and can aught grieve save Humanity?<br/>He cometh.<br/><br/>                         _Enter_ LUCIFER.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Mortal!<br/><br/>_Cain_.             Spirit, who art thou?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Master of spirits.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                        And being so, canst thou<br/>Leave them, and walk with dust?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                     I know the thoughts<br/>Of dust, and feel for it, and with you.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                How!<br/>You know my thoughts?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.            They are the thoughts of all<br/>Worthy of thought;--'tis your immortal part<br/>Which speaks within you.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                   What immortal part?<br/>This has not been revealed: the Tree of Life<br/>Was withheld from us by my father's folly,<br/>While that of Knowledge, by my mother's haste,<br/>Was plucked too soon; and all the fruit is Death!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. They have deceived thee; thou shalt live.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                               I live,<br/>But live to die; and, living, see no thing<br/>To make death hateful, save an innate clinging,<br/>A loathsome, and yet all invincible<br/>Instinct of life, which I abhor, as I<br/>Despise myself, yet cannot overcome--<br/>And so I live. Would I had never lived!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thou livest--and must live for ever. Think not<br/>The Earth, which is thine outward cov'ring, is<br/>Existence--it will cease--and thou wilt be--<br/>No less than thou art now.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                    No _less_! and why<br/>No more?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.    It may be thou shalt be as we.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And ye?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.      Are everlasting.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                         Are ye happy?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. We are mighty.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                    Are ye happy?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                               No: art thou?<br/><br/>_Cain_. How should I be so? Look on me!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                               Poor clay!<br/>And thou pretendest to be wretched! Thou!<br/><br/>_Cain_. I am:--and thou, with all thy might, what art thou?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. One who aspired to be what made thee, and<br/>Would not have made thee what thou art.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                 Ah!<br/>Thou look'st almost a god; and----<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                        I am none:<br/>And having failed to be one, would be nought<br/>Save what I am. He conquered; let him reign!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Who?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.   Thy Sire's maker--and the Earth's.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                        And Heaven's,<br/>And all that in them is. So I have heard<br/>His Seraphs sing; and so my father saith.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. They say--what they must sing and say, on pain<br/>Of being that which I am,--and thou art--<br/>Of spirits and of men.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                And what is that?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Souls who dare use their immortality--<br/>Souls who dare look the Omnipotent tyrant in<br/>His everlasting face, and tell him that<br/>His evil is not good! If he has made,<br/>As he saith--which I know not, nor believe--<br/>But, if he made us--he cannot unmake:<br/>We are immortal!--nay, he'd _have_ us so,<br/>That he may torture:--let him! He is great--<br/>But, in his greatness, is no happier than<br/>We in our conflict! Goodness would not make<br/>Evil; and what else hath he made? But let him<br/>Sit on his vast and solitary throne--<br/>Creating worlds, to make eternity<br/>Less burthensome to his immense existence<br/>And unparticipated solitude;<br/>Let him crowd orb on orb: he is alone<br/>Indefinite, Indissoluble Tyrant;<br/>Could he but crush himself, 'twere the best boon<br/>He ever granted: but let him reign on!<br/>And multiply himself in misery!<br/>Spirits and Men, at least we sympathise--<br/>And, suffering in concert, make our pangs<br/>Innumerable, more endurable,<br/>By the unbounded sympathy of all<br/>With all! But _He_! so wretched in his height,<br/>So restless in his wretchedness, must still<br/>Create, and re-create--perhaps he'll make<br/>One day a Son unto himself--as he<br/>Gave you a father--and if he so doth,<br/>Mark me! that Son will be a sacrifice!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Thou speak'st to me of things which long have swum<br/>In visions through my thought: I never could<br/>Reconcile what I saw with what I heard.<br/>My father and my mother talk to me<br/>Of serpents, and of fruits and trees: I see<br/>The gates of what they call their Paradise<br/>Guarded by fiery-sworded Cherubim,<br/>Which shut them out--and me: I feel the weight<br/>Of daily toil, and constant thought: I look<br/>Around a world where I seem nothing, with<br/>Thoughts which arise within me, as if they<br/>Could master all things--but I thought alone<br/>This misery was _mine_. My father is<br/>Tamed down; my mother has forgot the mind<br/>Which made her thirst for knowledge at the risk<br/>Of an eternal curse; my brother is<br/>A watching shepherd boy, who offers up<br/>The firstlings of the flock to him who bids<br/>The earth yield nothing to us without sweat;<br/>My sister Zillah sings an earlier hymn<br/>Than the birds' matins; and my Adah--my<br/>Own and belov√©d--she, too, understands not<br/>The mind which overwhelms me: never till<br/>Now met I aught to sympathise with me.<br/>'Tis well--I rather would consort with spirits.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And hadst thou not been fit by thine own soul<br/>For such companionship, I would not now<br/>Have stood before thee as I am: a serpent<br/>Had been enough to charm ye, as before.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Ah! didst _thou_ tempt my mother?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                I tempt none,<br/>Save with the truth: was not the Tree, the Tree<br/>Of Knowledge? and was not the Tree of Life<br/>Still fruitful? Did _I_ bid her pluck them not?<br/>Did I plant things prohibited within<br/>The reach of beings innocent, and curious<br/>By their own innocence? I would have made ye<br/>Gods; and even He who thrust ye forth, so thrust ye<br/>Because "ye should not eat the fruits of life,<br/>And become gods as we." Were those his words?<br/><br/>_Cain_.   They were, as I have heard from those who heard them,<br/>In thunder.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.    Then who was the Demon? He<br/>Who would not let ye live, or he who would<br/>Have made ye live for ever, in the joy<br/>And power of Knowledge?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                Would they had snatched both<br/>The fruits, or neither!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              One is yours already,<br/>The other may be still.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  How so?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                      By being<br/>Yourselves, in your resistance. Nothing can<br/>Quench the mind, if the mind will be itself<br/>And centre of surrounding things--'tis made<br/>To sway.<br/><br/>_Cain_.   But didst thou tempt my parents?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                  I?<br/>Poor clay--what should I tempt them for, or how?<br/><br/>_Cain_. They say the Serpent was a spirit.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                   Who<br/>Saith that? It is not written so on high:<br/>The proud One will not so far falsify,<br/>Though man's vast fears and little vanity<br/>Would make him cast upon the spiritual nature<br/>His own low failing. The snake _was_ the snake--<br/>No more; and yet not less than those he tempted,<br/>In nature being earth also--_more_ in _wisdom_,<br/>Since he could overcome them, and foreknew<br/>The knowledge fatal to their narrow joys.<br/>Think'st thou I'd take the shape of things that die?<br/><br/>_Cain_. But the thing had a demon?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                         He but woke one<br/>In those he spake to with his forky tongue.<br/>I tell thee that the Serpent was no more<br/>Than a mere serpent: ask the Cherubim<br/>Who guard the tempting tree. When thousand ages<br/>Have rolled o'er your dead ashes, and your seed's,<br/>The seed of the then world may thus array<br/>Their earliest fault in fable, and attribute<br/>To me a shape I scorn, as I scorn all<br/>That bows to him, who made things but to bend<br/>Before his sullen, sole eternity;<br/>But we, who see the truth, must speak it. Thy<br/>Fond parents listened to a creeping thing,<br/>And fell. For what should spirits tempt them? What<br/>Was there to envy in the narrow bounds<br/>Of Paradise, that spirits who pervade<br/>Space----but I speak to thee of what thou know'st not,<br/>With all thy Tree of Knowledge.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                         But thou canst not<br/>Speak aught of Knowledge which I would not know,<br/>And do not thirst to know, and bear a mind<br/>To know.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.   And heart to look on?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                           Be it proved.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Darest thou look on Death?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                He has not yet<br/>Been seen.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. But must be undergone.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            My father<br/>Says he is something dreadful, and my mother<br/>Weeps when he's named; and Abel lifts his eyes<br/>To Heaven, and Zillah casts hers to the earth,<br/>And sighs a prayer; and Adah looks on me,<br/>And speaks not.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     And thou?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 Thoughts unspeakable<br/>Crowd in my breast to burning, when I hear<br/>Of this almighty Death, who is, it seems,<br/>Inevitable. Could I wrestle with him?<br/>I wrestled with the lion, when a boy,<br/>In play, till he ran roaring from my gripe.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. It has no shape; but will absorb all things<br/>That bear the form of earth-born being.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                 Ah!<br/>I thought it was a being: who could do<br/>Such evil things to beings save a being?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Ask the Destroyer.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       Who?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                        The Maker--Call him<br/>Which name thou wilt: he makes but to destroy.<br/><br/>_Cain_. I knew not that, yet thought it, since I heard<br/>Of Death: although I know not what it is--<br/>Yet it seems horrible. I have looked out<br/>In the vast desolate night in search of him;<br/>And when I saw gigantic shadows in<br/>The umbrage of the walls of Eden, chequered<br/>By the far-flashing of the Cherubs' swords,<br/>I watched for what I thought his coming; for<br/>With fear rose longing in my heart to know<br/>What 'twas which shook us all--but nothing came.<br/>And then I turned my weary eyes from off<br/>Our native and forbidden Paradise,<br/>Up to the lights above us, in the azure,<br/>Which are so beautiful: shall they, too, die?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Perhaps--but long outlive both thine and thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_. I'm glad of that: I would not have them die--<br/>They are so lovely. What is Death? I fear,<br/>I feel, it is a dreadful thing; but what,<br/>I cannot compass: 'tis denounced against us,<br/>Both them who sinned and sinned not, as an ill--<br/>What ill?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. To be resolved into the earth.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But shall I know it?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                   As I know not death,<br/>I cannot answer.<br/><br/>_Cain_.              Were I quiet earth,<br/>That were no evil: would I ne'er had been<br/>Aught else but dust!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           That is a _grovelling_ wish,<br/>Less than thy father's--for he wished to know!<br/><br/>_Cain_. But not to live--or wherefore plucked he not<br/>The Life-tree?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.    He was hindered.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       Deadly error!<br/>Not to snatch first that fruit:--but ere he plucked<br/>The knowledge, he was ignorant of Death.<br/>Alas! I scarcely now know what it is,<br/>And yet I fear it--fear I know not what!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And I, who know all things, fear nothing; see<br/>What is true knowledge.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 Wilt thou teach me all?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Aye, upon one condition.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              Name it.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                    That<br/>Thou dost fall down and worship me--thy Lord.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Thou art not the Lord my father worships.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                         No.<br/><br/>_Cain_. His equal?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.        No;--I have nought in common with him!<br/>Nor would: I would be aught above--beneath--<br/>Aught save a sharer or a servant of<br/>His power. I dwell apart; but I am great:--<br/>Many there are who worship me, and more<br/>Who shall--be thou amongst the first.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              I never<br/>As yet have bowed unto my father's God.<br/>Although my brother Abel oft implores<br/>That I would join with him in sacrifice:--<br/>Why should I bow to thee?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                 Hast thou ne'er bowed<br/>To him?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Have I not said it?--need I say it?<br/>Could not thy mighty knowledge teach thee that?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. He who bows not to him has bowed to me.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But I will bend to neither.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                          Ne'er the less,<br/>Thou art my worshipper; not worshipping<br/>Him makes thee mine the same.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       And what is that?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thou'lt know here--and hereafter.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                      Let me but<br/>Be taught the mystery of my being.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                        Follow<br/>Where I will lead thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 But I must retire<br/>To till the earth--for I had promised----<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                What?<br/><br/>_Cain_. To cull some first-fruits.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                        Why?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                               To offer up<br/>With Abel on an altar.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.            Said'st thou not<br/>Thou ne'er hadst bent to him who made thee?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                     Yes--<br/>But Abel's earnest prayer has wrought upon me;<br/>The offering is more his than mine--and Adah----<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Why dost thou hesitate?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                           She is my sister,<br/>Born on the same day, of the same womb; and<br/>She wrung from me, with tears, this promise; and<br/>Rather than see her weep, I would, methinks,<br/>Bear all--and worship aught.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                   Then follow me!<br/><br/>_Cain_. I will.<br/><br/>                          _Enter_ ADAH.<br/><br/>_Adah_.         My brother, I have come for thee;<br/>It is our hour of rest and joy--and we<br/>Have less without thee. Thou hast laboured not<br/>This morn; but I have done thy task: the fruits<br/>Are ripe, and glowing as the light which ripens:<br/>Come away.<br/><br/>_Cain_.    Seest thou not?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                    I see an angel;<br/>We have seen many: will he share our hour<br/>Of rest?--he is welcome.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  But he is not like<br/>The angels we have seen.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                  Are there, then, others?<br/>But he is welcome, as they were: they deigned<br/>To be our guests--will he?<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_to Lucifer_).    Wilt thou?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                          I ask<br/>Thee to be mine.<br/><br/>_Cain_.          I must away with him.<br/><br/>_Adah_. And leave us?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                Aye.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                     And _me_?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              Belov√©d Adah!<br/><br/>_Adah_. Let me go with thee.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                   No, she must not.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                                       Who<br/>Art thou that steppest between heart and heart?<br/><br/>_Cain_. He is a God.<br/><br/>_Adah_.              How know'st thou?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                               He speaks like<br/>A God.<br/><br/>_Adah_. So did the Serpent, and it lied.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thou errest, Adah!--was not the Tree that<br/>Of Knowledge?<br/><br/>_Adah_.      Aye--to our eternal sorrow.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And yet that grief is knowledge--so he lied not:<br/>And if he did betray you, 'twas with Truth;<br/>And Truth in its own essence cannot be<br/>But good.<br/><br/>_Adah_.    But all we know of it has gathered<br/>Evil on ill; expulsion from our home,<br/>And dread, and toil, and sweat, and heaviness;<br/>Remorse of that which was--and hope of that<br/>Which cometh not. Cain! walk not with this Spirit.<br/>Bear with what we have borne, and love me--I<br/>Love thee.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. More than thy mother, and thy sire?<br/><br/>_Adah_. I do. Is that a sin, too?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                         No, not yet;<br/>It one day will be in your children.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                             What!<br/>Must not my daughter love her brother Enoch?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Not as thou lovest Cain.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                             Oh, my God!<br/>Shall they not love and bring forth things that love<br/>Out of their love? have they not drawn their milk<br/>Out of this bosom? was not he, their father,<br/>Born of the same sole womb, in the same hour<br/>With me? did we not love each other? and<br/>In multiplying our being multiply<br/>Things which will love each other as we love<br/>Them?--And as I love thee, my Cain! go not<br/>Forth with this spirit; he is not of ours.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. The sin I speak of is not of my making,<br/>And cannot be a sin in you--whate'er<br/>It seem in those who will replace ye in<br/>Mortality.<br/><br/>_Adah_. What is the sin which is not<br/>Sin in itself? Can circumstance make sin<br/>Or virtue?--if it doth, we are the slaves<br/>Of----<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Higher things than ye are slaves: and higher<br/>Than them or ye would be so, did they not<br/>Prefer an independency of torture<br/>To the smooth agonies of adulation,<br/>In hymns and harpings, and self-seeking prayers,<br/>To that which is omnipotent, because<br/>It is omnipotent, and not from love,<br/>But terror and self-hope.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                   Omnipotence<br/>Must be all goodness.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.            Was it so in Eden?<br/><br/>_Adah_. Fiend! tempt me not with beauty; thou art fairer<br/>Than was the Serpent, and as false.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                          As true.<br/>Ask Eve, your mother: bears she not the knowledge<br/>Of good and evil?<br/><br/>_Adah_.          Oh, my mother! thou<br/>Hast plucked a fruit more fatal to thine offspring<br/>Than to thyself; thou at the least hast passed<br/>Thy youth in Paradise, in innocent<br/>And happy intercourse with happy spirits:<br/>But we, thy children, ignorant of Eden,<br/>Are girt about by demons, who assume<br/>The words of God, and tempt us with our own<br/>Dissatisfied and curious thoughts--as thou<br/>Wert worked on by the snake, in thy most flushed<br/>And heedless, harmless wantonness of bliss.<br/>I cannot answer this immortal thing<br/>Which stands before me; I cannot abhor him;<br/>I look upon him with a pleasing fear,<br/>And yet I fly not from him: in his eye<br/>There is a fastening attraction which<br/>Fixes my fluttering eyes on his; my heart<br/>Beats quick; he awes me, and yet draws me near,<br/>Nearer and nearer:--Cain--Cain--save me from him!<br/><br/>_Cain_. What dreads my Adah? This is no ill spirit.<br/><br/>_Adah_. He is not God--nor God's: I have beheld<br/>The Cherubs and the Seraphs; he looks not<br/>Like them.<br/><br/>_Cain_.   But there are spirits loftier still--<br/>The archangels.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     And still loftier than the archangels.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Aye--but not bless√©d.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                    If the blessedness<br/>Consists in slavery--no.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                 I have heard it said,<br/>The Seraphs _love most_--Cherubim _know most_--<br/>And this should be a Cherub--since he loves not.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And if the higher knowledge quenches love,<br/>What must _he be_ you cannot love when known?<br/>Since the all-knowing Cherubim love least,<br/>The Seraphs' love can be but ignorance:<br/>That they are not compatible, the doom<br/>Of thy fond parents, for their daring, proves.<br/>Choose betwixt Love and Knowledge--since there is<br/>No other choice: your sire hath chosen already:<br/>His worship is but fear.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                 Oh, Cain! choose Love.<br/><br/>_Cain_. For thee, my Adah, I choose not--It was<br/>Born with me--but I love nought else.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                              Our parents?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Did they love us when they snatched from the Tree<br/>That which hath driven us all from Paradise?<br/><br/>_Adah_. We were not born then--and if we had been,<br/>Should we not love them--and our children, Cain?<br/><br/>_Cain_. My little Enoch! and his lisping sister!<br/>Could I but deem them happy, I would half<br/>Forget----but it can never be forgotten<br/>Through thrice a thousand generations! never<br/>Shall men love the remembrance of the man<br/>Who sowed the seed of evil and mankind<br/>In the same hour! They plucked the tree of science<br/>And sin--and, not content with their own sorrow,<br/>Begot _me_--_thee_--and all the few that are,<br/>And all the unnumbered and innumerable<br/>Multitudes, millions, myriads, which may be,<br/>To inherit agonies accumulated<br/>By ages!--and _I_ must be sire of such things!<br/>Thy beauty and thy love--my love and joy,<br/>The rapturous moment and the placid hour,<br/>All we love in our children and each other,<br/>But lead them and ourselves through many years<br/>Of sin and pain--or few, but still of sorrow,<br/>Interchecked with an instant of brief pleasure,<br/>To Death--the unknown! Methinks the Tree of Knowledge<br/>Hath not fulfilled its promise:--if they sinned,<br/>At least they ought to have known all things that are<br/>Of knowledge--and the mystery of Death.<br/>What do they know?--that they are miserable.<br/>What need of snakes and fruits to teach us that?<br/><br/>_Adah_. I am not wretched, Cain, and if thou<br/>Wert happy----<br/><br/>_Cain_.       Be thou happy, then, alone--<br/>I will have nought to do with happiness,<br/>Which humbles me and mine.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                    Alone I could not,<br/>Nor _would_ be happy; but with those around us<br/>I think I could be so, despite of Death,<br/>Which, as I know it not, I dread not, though<br/>It seems an awful shadow--if I may<br/>Judge from what I have heard.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                    And thou couldst not<br/>_Alone_, thou say'st, be happy?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                         Alone! Oh, my God!<br/>Who could be happy and alone, or good?<br/>To me my solitude seems sin; unless<br/>When I think how soon I shall see my brother,<br/>His brother, and our children, and our parents.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Yet thy God is alone; and is he happy?<br/>Lonely, and good?<br/><br/>_Adah_.           He is not so; he hath<br/>The angels and the mortals to make happy,<br/>And thus becomes so in diffusing joy.<br/>What else can joy be, but the spreading joy?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Ask of your sire, the exile fresh from Eden;<br/>Or of his first-born son: ask your own heart;<br/>It is not tranquil.<br/><br/>_Adah_.            Alas! no! and you--<br/>Are you of Heaven?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.         If I am not, enquire<br/>The cause of this all-spreading happiness<br/>(Which you proclaim) of the all-great and good<br/>Maker of life and living things; it is<br/>His secret, and he keeps it. _We_ must bear,<br/>And some of us resist--and both in vain,<br/>His Seraphs say: but it is worth the trial,<br/>Since better may not be without: there is<br/>A wisdom in the spirit, which directs<br/>To right, as in the dim blue air the eye<br/>Of you, young mortals, lights at once upon<br/>The star which watches, welcoming the morn.<br/><br/>_Adah_. It is a beautiful star; I love it for<br/>Its beauty.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.    And why not adore?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                         Our father<br/>Adores the Invisible only.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                But the symbols<br/>Of the Invisible are the loveliest<br/>Of what is visible; and yon bright star<br/>Is leader of the host of Heaven.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                         Our father<br/>Saith that he has beheld the God himself<br/>Who made him and our mother.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  Hast _thou_ seen him?<br/><br/>_Adah_. Yes--in his works.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                 But in his being?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                                     No--<br/>Save in my father, who is God's own image;<br/>Or in his angels, who are like to thee--<br/>And brighter, yet less beautiful and powerful<br/>In seeming: as the silent sunny noon,<br/>All light, they look upon us; but thou seem'st<br/>Like an ethereal night, where long white clouds<br/>Streak the deep purple, and unnumbered stars<br/>Spangle the wonderful mysterious vault<br/>With things that look as if they would be suns;<br/>So beautiful, unnumbered, and endearing,<br/>Not dazzling, and yet drawing us to them,<br/>They fill my eyes with tears, and so dost thou.<br/>Thou seem'st unhappy: do not make us so,<br/>And I will weep for thee.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                Alas! those tears!<br/>Couldst thou but know what oceans will be shed----<br/><br/>_Adah_. By me?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     By all.<br/><br/>_Adah_.               What all?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                     The million millions--<br/>The myriad myriads--the all-peopled earth--<br/>The unpeopled earth--and the o'er-peopled Hell,<br/>Of which thy bosom is the germ.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                        O Cain!<br/>This spirit curseth us.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                Let him say on;<br/>Him will I follow.<br/><br/>_Adah_.            Whither?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                 To a place<br/>_Whence_ he shall come back to thee in an hour;<br/>But in that hour see things of many days.<br/><br/>_Adah_. How can that be?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.               Did not your Maker make<br/>Out of old worlds this new one in few days?<br/>And cannot I, who aided in this work,<br/>Show in an hour what he hath made in many,<br/>Or hath destroyed in few?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  Lead on.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                          Will he,<br/>In sooth, return within an hour?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                       He shall.<br/>With us acts are exempt from time, and we<br/>Can crowd eternity into an hour,<br/>Or stretch an hour into eternity:<br/>We breathe not by a mortal measurement--<br/>But that's a mystery. Cain, come on with me.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Will he return?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              Aye, woman! he alone<br/>Of mortals from that place (the first and last<br/>Who shall return, save ONE), shall come back to thee,<br/>To make that silent and expectant world<br/>As populous as this: at present there<br/>Are few inhabitants.<br/><br/>_Adah_.             Where dwellest thou?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Throughout all space. Where should I dwell? Where are<br/>Thy God or Gods--there am I: all things are<br/>Divided with me: Life and Death--and Time--<br/>Eternity--and heaven and earth--and that<br/>Which is not heaven nor earth, but peopled with<br/>Those who once peopled or shall people both--<br/>These are my realms! so that I do divide<br/>_His_, and possess a kingdom which is not<br/>_His_. If I were not that which I have said,<br/>Could I stand here? His angels are within<br/>Your vision.<br/><br/>_Adah_.      So they were when the fair Serpent<br/>Spoke with our mother first.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  Cain! thou hast heard.<br/>If thou dost long for knowledge, I can satiate<br/>That thirst; nor ask thee to partake of fruits<br/>Which shall deprive thee of a single good<br/>The Conqueror has left thee. Follow me.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Spirit, I have said it.<br/>                                         [_Exeunt_ LUCIFER _and_ CAIN.<br/><br/>_Adah_ (_follows exclaiming_).  Cain! my brother! Cain!<br/><br/>ACT II.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_The Abyss of Space_.<br/><br/>_Cain_. I tread on air, and sink not--yet I fear<br/>To sink.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Have faith in me, and thou shalt be<br/>Borne on the air, of which I am the Prince.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Can I do so without impiety?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Believe--and sink not! doubt--and perish! thus<br/>Would run the edict of the other God,<br/>Who names me Demon to his angels; they<br/>Echo the sound to miserable things,<br/>Which, knowing nought beyond their shallow senses,<br/>Worship the _word_ which strikes their ear, and deem<br/>Evil or good what is proclaimed to them<br/>In their abasement. I will have none such:<br/>Worship or worship not, thou shalt behold<br/>The worlds beyond thy little world, nor be<br/>Amerced for doubts beyond thy little life,<br/>With torture of _my_ dooming. There will come<br/>An hour, when, tossed upon some water-drops,<br/>A man shall say to a man, "Believe in me,<br/>And walk the waters;" and the man shall walk<br/>The billows and be safe. _I_ will not say,<br/>Believe in _me_, as a conditional creed<br/>To save thee; but fly with me o'er the gulf<br/>Of space an equal flight, and I will show<br/>What thou dar'st not deny,--the history<br/>Of past--and present, and of future worlds.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Oh God! or Demon! or whate'er thou art,<br/>Is yon our earth?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.        Dost thou not recognise<br/>The dust which formed your father?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            Can it be?<br/>Yon small blue circle, swinging in far ether,<br/>With an inferior circlet purpler it still,<br/>Which looks like that which lit our earthly night?<br/>Is this our Paradise? Where are its walls,<br/>And they who guard them?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.               Point me out the site<br/>Of Paradise.<br/><br/>_Cain_.      How should I? As we move<br/>Like sunbeams onward, it grows small and smaller,<br/>And as it waxes little, and then less,<br/>Gathers a halo round it, like the light<br/>Which shone the roundest of the stars, when I<br/>Beheld them from the skirts of Paradise:<br/>Methinks they both, as we recede from them,<br/>Appear to join the innumerable stars<br/>Which are around us; and, as we move on,<br/>Increase their myriads.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              And if there should be<br/>Worlds greater than thine own--inhabited<br/>By greater things--and they themselves far more<br/>In number than the dust of thy dull earth,<br/>Though multiplied to animated atoms,<br/>All living--and all doomed to death--and wretched,<br/>What wouldst thou think?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  I should be proud of thought<br/>Which knew such things.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              But if that high thought were<br/>Linked to a servile mass of matter--and,<br/>Knowing such things, aspiring to such things,<br/>And science still beyond them, were chained down<br/>To the most gross and petty paltry wants,<br/>All foul and fulsome--and the very best<br/>Of thine enjoyments a sweet degradation,<br/>A most enervating and filthy cheat<br/>To lure thee on to the renewal of<br/>Fresh souls and bodies, all foredoomed to be<br/>As frail, and few so happy----<br/><br/>_Cain_.                        Spirit! I<br/>Know nought of Death, save as a dreadful thing<br/>Of which I have heard my parents speak, as of<br/>A hideous heritage I owe to them<br/>No less than life--a heritage not happy,<br/>If I may judge, till now. But, Spirit! if<br/>It be as thou hast said (and I within<br/>Feel the prophetic torture of its truth),<br/>Here let me die: for to give birth to those<br/>Who can but suffer many years, and die--<br/>Methinks is merely propagating Death,<br/>And multiplying murder.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              Thou canst not<br/>_All_ die--there is what must survive.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                The Other<br/>Spake not of this unto my father, when<br/>He shut him forth from Paradise, with death<br/>Written upon his forehead. But at least<br/>Let what is mortal of me perish, that<br/>I may be in the rest as angels are.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. _I_ am angelic: wouldst thou be as I am?<br/><br/>_Cain_. I know not what thou art: I see thy power,<br/>And see thou show'st me things beyond _my_ power,<br/>Beyond all power of my born faculties,<br/>Although inferior still to my desires<br/>And my conceptions.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.          What are they which dwell<br/>So humbly in their pride, as to sojourn<br/>With worms in clay?<br/><br/>_Cain_.            And what art thou who dwellest<br/>So haughtily in spirit, and canst range<br/>Nature and immortality--and yet<br/>Seem'st sorrowful?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.         I seem that which I am;<br/>And therefore do I ask of thee, if thou<br/>Wouldst be immortal?<br/><br/>_Cain_.             Thou hast said, I must be<br/>Immortal in despite of me. I knew not<br/>This until lately--but since it must be,<br/>Let me, or happy or unhappy, learn<br/>To anticipate my immortality.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thou didst before I came upon thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                        How?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. By suffering.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  And must torture be immortal?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. We and thy sons will try. But now, behold!<br/>Is it not glorious?<br/><br/>_Cain_.             Oh thou beautiful<br/>And unimaginable ether! and<br/>Ye multiplying masses of increased<br/>And still-increasing lights! what are ye? what<br/>Is this blue wilderness of interminable<br/>Air, where ye roll along, as I have seen<br/>The leaves along the limpid streams of Eden?<br/>Is your course measured for ye? Or do ye<br/>Sweep on in your unbounded revelry<br/>Through an a√´rial universe of endless<br/>Expansion--at which my soul aches to think--<br/>Intoxicated with eternity?<br/>Oh God! Oh Gods! or whatsoe'er ye are!<br/>How beautiful ye are! how beautiful<br/>Your works, or accidents, or whatsoe'er<br/>They may be! Let me die, as atoms die,<br/>(If that they die), or know ye in your might<br/>And knowledge! My thoughts are not in this hour<br/>Unworthy what I see, though my dust is;<br/>Spirit! let me expire, or see them nearer.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Art thou not nearer? look back to thine earth!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Where is it? I see nothing save a mass<br/>Of most innumerable lights.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  Look there!<br/><br/>_Cain_. I cannot see it.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.               Yet it sparkles still.<br/><br/>_Cain_. That!--yonder!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.            Yea.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                   And wilt thou tell me so?<br/>Why, I have seen the fire-flies and fire-worms<br/>Sprinkle the dusky groves and the green banks<br/>In the dim twilight, brighter than yon world<br/>Which bears them.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.        Thou hast seen both worms and worlds,<br/>Each bright and sparkling--what dost think of them?<br/><br/>_Cain_. That they are beautiful in their own sphere,<br/>And that the night, which makes both beautiful,<br/>The little shining fire-fly in its flight,<br/>And the immortal star in its great course,<br/>Must both be guided.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           But by whom or what?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Show me.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.       Dar'st thou behold?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            How know I what<br/>I _dare_ behold? As yet, thou hast shown nought<br/>I dare not gaze on further.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  On, then, with me.<br/>Wouldst thou behold things mortal or immortal?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Why, what are things?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  _Both_ partly: but what doth<br/>Sit next thy heart?<br/><br/>_Cain_.            The things I see.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                          But what<br/>_Sate_ nearest it?<br/><br/>_Cain_.           The things I have not seen,<br/>Nor ever shall--the mysteries of Death.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. What, if I show to thee things which have died,<br/>As I have shown thee much which cannot die?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Do so.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     Away, then! on our mighty wings!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Oh! how we cleave the blue! The stars fade from us!<br/>The earth! where is my earth? Let me look on it,<br/>For I was made of it.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           'Tis now beyond thee,<br/>Less, in the universe, than thou in it;<br/>Yet deem not that thou canst escape it; thou<br/>Shalt soon return to earth, and all its dust:<br/>'Tis part of thy eternity, and mine.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Where dost thou lead me?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                      To what was before thee!<br/>The phantasm of the world; of which thy world<br/>Is but the wreck.<br/><br/>_Cain_.           What! is it not then new?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. No more than life is; and that was ere thou<br/>Or _I_ were, or the things which seem to us<br/>Greater than either: many things will have<br/>No end; and some, which would pretend to have<br/>Had no beginning, have had one as mean<br/>As thou; and mightier things have been extinct<br/>To make way for much meaner than we can<br/>Surmise; for _moments_ only and the _space_<br/>Have been and must be all _unchangeable_.<br/>But changes make not death, except to clay;<br/>But thou art clay--and canst but comprehend<br/>That which was clay, and such thou shall behold.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Clay--Spirit--what thou wilt--I can survey.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Away, then!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                But the lights fade from me fast,<br/>And some till now grew larger as we approached,<br/>And wore the look of worlds.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                   And such they are.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And Edens in them?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                 It may be.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              And men?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Yea, or things higher.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                           Aye! and serpents too?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Wouldst thou have men without them? must no reptiles<br/>Breathe, save the erect ones?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       How the lights recede!<br/>Where fly we?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.    To the world of phantoms, which<br/>Are beings past, and shadows still to come.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But it grows dark, and dark--the stars are gone!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And yet thou seest.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       'Tis a fearful light!<br/>No sun--no moon--no lights innumerable--<br/>The very blue of the empurpled night<br/>Fades to a dreary twilight--yet I see<br/>Huge dusky masses; but unlike the worlds<br/>We were approaching, which, begirt with light,<br/>Seemed full of life even when their atmosphere<br/>Of light gave way, and showed them taking shapes<br/>Unequal, of deep valleys and vast mountains;<br/>And some emitting sparks, and some displaying<br/>Enormous liquid plains, and some begirt<br/>With luminous belts, and floating moons, which took,<br/>Like them, the features of fair earth:--instead,<br/>All here seems dark and dreadful.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                         But distinct.<br/>Thou seekest to behold Death, and dead things?<br/><br/>_Cain_. I seek it not; but as I know there are<br/>Such, and that my sire's sin makes him and me,<br/>And all that we inherit, liable<br/>To such, I would behold, at once, what I<br/>Must one day see perforce.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  Behold!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            'Tis darkness!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And so it shall be ever--but we will<br/>Unfold its gates!<br/><br/>_Cain_.           Enormous vapours roll<br/>Apart--what's this?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.          Enter!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                   Can I return?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Return! be sure: how else should Death be peopled?<br/>Its present realm is thin to what it will be,<br/>Through thee and thine.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 The clouds still open wide<br/>And wider, and make widening circles round us!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Advance!<br/><br/>_Cain_.             And thou!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                   Fear not--without me thou<br/>Couldst not have gone beyond thy world. On! on!<br/>                                 [_They disappear through the clouds_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_Hades_.<br/><br/>                   _Enter_ LUCIFER _and_ CAIN.<br/><br/>_Cain_. How silent and how vast are these dim worlds!<br/>For they seem more than one, and yet more peopled<br/>Than the huge brilliant luminous orbs which swung<br/>So thickly in the upper air, that I<br/>Had deemed them rather the bright populace<br/>Of some all unimaginable Heaven,<br/>Than things to be inhabited themselves,<br/>But that on drawing near them I beheld<br/>Their swelling into palpable immensity<br/>Of matter, which seemed made for life to dwell on,<br/>Rather than life itself. But here, all is<br/>So shadowy, and so full of twilight, that<br/>It speaks of a day past.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              It is the realm<br/>Of Death.--Wouldst have it present?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                             Till I know<br/>That which it really is, I cannot answer.<br/>But if it be as I have heard my father<br/>Deal out in his long homilies, 'tis a thing--<br/>Oh God! I dare not think on't! Curs√©d be<br/>He who invented Life that leads to Death!<br/>Or the dull mass of life, that, being life,<br/>Could not retain, but needs must forfeit it--<br/>Even for the innocent!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.             Dost thou curse thy father?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Cursed he not me in giving me my birth?<br/>Cursed he not me before my birth, in daring<br/>To pluck the fruit forbidden?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                    Thou say'st well:<br/>The curse is mutual 'twixt thy sire and thee--<br/>But for thy sons and brother?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                       Let them share it<br/>With me, their sire and brother! What else is<br/>Bequeathed to me? I leave them my inheritance!<br/>Oh, ye interminable gloomy realms<br/>Of swimming shadows and enormous shapes,<br/>Some fully shown, some indistinct, and all<br/>Mighty and melancholy--what are ye?<br/>Live ye, or have ye lived?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                 Somewhat of both.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Then what is Death?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                  What? Hath not he who made ye<br/>Said 'tis another life?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 Till now he hath<br/>Said nothing, save that all shall die.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                             Perhaps<br/>He one day will unfold that further secret.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Happy the day!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.             Yes; happy! when unfolded,<br/>Through agonies unspeakable, and clogged<br/>With agonies eternal, to innumerable<br/>Yet unborn myriads of unconscious atoms,<br/>All to be animated for this only!<br/><br/>_Cain_. What are these mighty phantoms which I see<br/>Floating around me?--They wear not the form<br/>Of the Intelligences I have seen<br/>Round our regretted and unentered Eden;<br/>Nor wear the form of man as I have viewed it<br/>In Adam's and in Abel's, and in mine,<br/>Nor in my sister-bride's, nor in my children's:<br/>And yet they have an aspect, which, though not<br/>Of men nor angels, looks like something, which,<br/>If not the last, rose higher than the first,<br/>Haughty, and high, and beautiful, and full<br/>Of seeming strength, but of inexplicable<br/>Shape; for I never saw such. They bear not<br/>The wing of Seraph, nor the face of man,<br/>Nor form of mightiest brute, nor aught that is<br/>Now breathing; mighty yet and beautiful<br/>As the most beautiful and mighty which<br/>Live, and yet so unlike them, that I scarce<br/>Can call them living.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.               Yet they lived.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                  Where?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                      Where<br/>Thou livest.<br/><br/>_Cain_.     When?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.       On what thou callest earth<br/>They did inhabit.<br/><br/>_Cain_.           Adam is the first.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Of thine, I grant thee--but too mean to be<br/>The last of these.<br/><br/>_Cain_.            And what are they?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                           That which<br/>Thou shalt be.<br/><br/>_Cain_.        But what _were_ they?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                          Living, high,<br/>Intelligent, good, great, and glorious things,<br/>As much superior unto all thy sire<br/>Adam could e'er have been in Eden, as<br/>The sixty-thousandth generation shall be,<br/>In its dull damp degeneracy, to<br/>Thee and thy son;--and how weak they are, judge<br/>By thy own flesh.<br/><br/>_Cain_.           Ah me! and did _they_ perish?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Yes, from their earth, as thou wilt fade from thine.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But was _mine_ theirs?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                      It was.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                But not as now.<br/>It is too little and too lowly to<br/>Sustain such creatures.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.              True, it was more glorious.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And wherefore did it fall?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                         Ask him who fells.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But how?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.        By a most crushing and inexorable<br/>Destruction and disorder of the elements,<br/>Which struck a world to chaos, as a chaos<br/>Subsiding has struck out a world: such things,<br/>Though rare in time, are frequent in eternity.--<br/>Pass on, and gaze upon the past.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                          'Tis awful!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And true. Behold these phantoms! they were once<br/>Material as thou art.<br/><br/>_Cain_.               And must I be<br/>Like them?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Let He who made thee answer that.<br/>I show thee what thy predecessors are,<br/>And what they _were_ thou feelest, in degree<br/>Inferior as thy petty feelings and<br/>Thy pettier portion of the immortal part<br/>Of high intelligence and earthly strength.<br/>What ye in common have with what they had<br/>Is Life, and what ye _shall_ have--Death: the rest<br/>Of your poor attributes is such as suits<br/>Reptiles engendered out of the subsiding<br/>Slime of a mighty universe, crushed into<br/>A scarcely-yet shaped planet, peopled with<br/>Things whose enjoyment was to be in blindness--<br/>A Paradise of Ignorance, from which<br/>Knowledge was barred as poison. But behold<br/>What these superior beings are or were;<br/>Or, if it irk thee, turn thee back and till<br/>The earth, thy task--I'll waft thee there in safety.<br/><br/>_Cain_. No: I'll stay here.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                   How long?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                               For ever! Since<br/>I must one day return here from the earth,<br/>I rather would remain; I am sick of all<br/>That dust has shown me--let me dwell in shadows.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. It cannot be: thou now beholdest as<br/>A vision that which is reality.<br/>To make thyself fit for this dwelling, thou<br/>Must pass through what the things thou seest have passed--<br/>The gates of Death.<br/><br/>_Cain_.             By what gate have we entered<br/>Even now?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. By mine! But, plighted to return,<br/>My spirit buoys thee up to breathe in regions<br/>Where all is breathless save thyself. Gaze on;<br/>But do not think to dwell here till thine hour<br/>Is come!<br/><br/>_Cain_. And these, too--can they ne'er repass<br/>To earth again?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.      _Their_ earth is gone for ever--<br/>So changed by its convulsion, they would not<br/>Be conscious to a single present spot<br/>Of its new scarcely hardened surface--'twas--<br/>Oh, what a beautiful world it _was_!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                               And is!<br/>It is not with the earth, though I must till it,<br/>I feel at war--but that I may not profit<br/>By what it bears of beautiful, untoiling,<br/>Nor gratify my thousand swelling thoughts<br/>With knowledge, nor allay my thousand fears<br/>Of Death and Life.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.       What thy world is, thou see'st,<br/>But canst not comprehend the shadow of<br/>That which it was.<br/><br/>_Cain_.            And those enormous creatures,<br/>Phantoms inferior in intelligence<br/>(At least so seeming) to the things we have passed,<br/>Resembling somewhat the wild habitants<br/>Of the deep woods of earth, the hugest which<br/>Roar nightly in the forest, but ten-fold<br/>In magnitude and terror; taller than<br/>The cherub-guarded walls of Eden--with<br/>Eyes flashing like the fiery swords which fence them--<br/>And tusks projecting like the trees stripped of<br/>Their bark and branches--what were they?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                               That which<br/>The Mammoth is in thy world;--but these lie<br/>By myriads underneath its surface.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            But<br/>None on it?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.   No: for thy frail race to war<br/>With them would render the curse on it useless--<br/>'Twould be destroyed so early.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                        But why _war_?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. You have forgotten the denunciation<br/>Which drove your race from Eden--war with all things,<br/>And death to all things, and disease to most things,<br/>And pangs, and bitterness; these were the fruits<br/>Of the forbidden tree.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                But animals--<br/>Did they, too, eat of it, that they must die?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Your Maker told ye, _they_ were made for you,<br/>As you for him.--You would not have their doom<br/>Superior to your own? Had Adam not<br/>Fallen, all had stood.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 Alas! the hopeless wretches!<br/>They too must share my sire's fate, like his sons;<br/>Like them, too, without having shared the apple;<br/>Like them, too, without the so dear-bought _knowledge_!<br/>It was a lying tree--for we _know_ nothing.<br/>At least it _promised knowledge_ at the _price_<br/>Of death--but _knowledge_ still: but what _knows_ man?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. It may be death leads to the _highest_ knowledge;<br/>And being of all things the sole thing certain,<br/>At least leads to the _surest_ science: therefore<br/>The Tree was true, though deadly.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                          These dim realms!<br/>I see them, but I know them not.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                    Because<br/>Thy hour is yet afar, and matter cannot<br/>Comprehend spirit wholly--but 'tis something<br/>To know there are such realms.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                        We knew already<br/>That there was Death.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.            But not what was beyond it.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Nor know I now.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.             Thou knowest that there is<br/>A state, and many states beyond thine own--<br/>And this thou knewest not this morn.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              But all<br/>Seems dim and shadowy.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.             Be content; it will<br/>Seem clearer to thine immortality.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And yon immeasurable liquid space<br/>Of glorious azure which floats on beyond us,<br/>Which looks like water, and which I should deem<br/>The river which flows out of Paradise<br/>Past my own dwelling, but that it is bankless<br/>And boundless, and of an ethereal hue--<br/>What is it?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.   There is still some such on earth,<br/>Although inferior, and thy children shall<br/>Dwell near it--'tis the phantasm of an Ocean.<br/><br/>_Cain_. 'Tis like another world; a liquid sun--<br/>And those inordinate creatures sporting o'er<br/>Its shining surface?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           Are its inhabitants,<br/>The past Leviathans.<br/><br/>_Cain_.               And yon immense<br/>Serpent, which rears his dripping mane and vasty<br/>Head, ten times higher than the haughtiest cedar,<br/>Forth from the abyss, looking as he could coil<br/>Himself around the orbs we lately looked on--<br/>Is he not of the kind which basked beneath<br/>The Tree in Eden?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.         Eve, thy mother, best<br/>Can tell what shape of serpent tempted her.<br/><br/>_Cain_. This seems too terrible. No doubt the other<br/>Had more of beauty.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           Hast thou ne'er beheld him?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Many of the same kind (at least so called)<br/>But never that precisely, which persuaded<br/>The fatal fruit, nor even of the same aspect.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Your father saw him not?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                             No: 'twas my mother<br/>Who tempted him--she tempted by the serpent.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Good man! whene'er thy wife, or thy sons' wives,<br/>Tempt thee or them to aught that's new or strange,<br/>Be sure thou seest first who hath tempted _them_!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Thy precept comes too late: there is no more<br/>For serpents to tempt woman to.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                      But there<br/>Are some things still which woman may tempt man to,<br/>And man tempt woman:--let thy sons look to it!<br/>My counsel is a kind one; for 'tis even<br/>Given chiefly at my own expense; 'tis true,<br/>'Twill not be followed, so there's little lost.<br/><br/>_Cain_. I understand not this.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                     The happier thou!--<br/>Thy world and thou are still too young! Thou thinkest<br/>Thyself most wicked and unhappy--is it<br/>Not so?<br/><br/>_Cain_. For crime, I know not; but for pain,<br/>I have felt much.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.        First-born of the first man!<br/>Thy present state of sin--and thou art evil,<br/>Of sorrow--and thou sufferest, are both Eden<br/>In all its innocence compared to what<br/>_Thou_ shortly may'st be; and that state again,<br/>In its redoubled wretchedness, a Paradise<br/>To what thy sons' sons' sons, accumulating<br/>In generations like to dust (which they<br/>In fact but add to), shall endure and do.--<br/>Now let us back to earth!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                   And wherefore didst thou<br/>Lead me here only to inform me this?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Was not thy quest for knowledge?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                     Yes--as being<br/>The road to happiness!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.             If truth be so,<br/>Thou hast it.<br/><br/>_Cain_.       Then my father's God did well<br/>When he prohibited the fatal Tree.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. But had done better in not planting it.<br/>But ignorance of evil doth not save<br/>From evil; it must still roll on the same,<br/>A part of all things.<br/><br/>_Cain_.               Not of all things. No--<br/>I'll not believe it--for I thirst for good.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And who and what doth not? _Who_ covets evil<br/>For its own bitter sake?--_None_--nothing! 'tis<br/>The leaven of all life, and lifelessness.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Within those glorious orbs which we behold,<br/>Distant, and dazzling, and innumerable,<br/>Ere we came down into this phantom realm,<br/>Ill cannot come: they are too beautiful.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thou hast seen them from afar.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                   And what of that?<br/>Distance can but diminish glory--they,<br/>When nearer, must be more ineffable.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Approach the things of earth most beautiful,<br/>And judge their beauty near.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      I have done this--<br/>The loveliest thing I know is loveliest nearest.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Then there must be delusion.--What is that<br/>Which being nearest to thine eyes is still<br/>More beautiful than beauteous things remote?<br/><br/>_Cain_. My sister Adah.--All the stars of heaven,<br/>The deep blue noon of night, lit by an orb<br/>Which looks a spirit, or a spirit's world--<br/>The hues of twilight--the Sun's gorgeous coming--<br/>His setting indescribable, which fills<br/>My eyes with pleasant tears as I behold<br/>Him sink, and feel my heart float softly with him<br/>Along that western paradise of clouds--<br/>The forest shade, the green bough, the bird's voice--<br/>The vesper bird's, which seems to sing of love,<br/>And mingles with the song of Cherubim,<br/>As the day closes over Eden's walls;--<br/>All these are nothing, to my eyes and heart,<br/>Like Adah's face: I turn from earth and heaven<br/>To gaze on it.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.      'Tis fair as frail mortality,<br/>In the first dawn and bloom of young creation,<br/>And earliest embraces of earth's parents,<br/>Can make its offspring; still it is delusion.<br/><br/>_Cain_. You think so, being not her brother.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                    Mortal!<br/>My brotherhood's with those who have no children.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Then thou canst have no fellowship with us.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. It may be that thine own shall be for me.<br/>But if thou dost possess a beautiful<br/>Being beyond all beauty in thine eyes,<br/>Why art thou wretched?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                Why do I exist?<br/>Why art _thou_ wretched? why are all things so?<br/>Ev'n he who made us must be, as the maker<br/>Of things unhappy! To produce destruction<br/>Can surely never be the task of joy,<br/>And yet my sire says he's omnipotent:<br/>Then why is Evil--he being Good? I asked<br/>This question of my father; and he said,<br/>Because this Evil only was the path<br/>To Good. Strange Good, that must arise from out<br/>Its deadly opposite. I lately saw<br/>A lamb stung by a reptile: the poor suckling<br/>Lay foaming on the earth, beneath the vain<br/>And piteous bleating of its restless dam;<br/>My father plucked some herbs, and laid them to<br/>The wound; and by degrees the helpless wretch<br/>Resumed its careless life, and rose to drain<br/>The mother's milk, who o'er it tremulous<br/>Stood licking its reviving limbs with joy.<br/>Behold, my son! said Adam, how from Evil<br/>Springs Good!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     What didst thou answer?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                Nothing; for<br/>He is my father: but I thought, that 'twere<br/>A better portion for the animal<br/>Never to have been _stung at all_, than to<br/>Purchase renewal of its little life<br/>With agonies unutterable, though<br/>Dispelled by antidotes.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.             But as thou saidst<br/>Of all belov√©d things thou lovest her<br/>Who shared thy mother's milk, and giveth hers<br/>Unto thy children----<br/><br/>_Cain_.               Most assuredly:<br/>What should I be without her?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                    What am I?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Dost thou love nothing?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                      What does thy God love?<br/><br/>_Cain_. All things, my father says; but I confess<br/>I see it not in their allotment here.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And, therefore, thou canst not see if _I_ love<br/>Or no--except some vast and general purpose,<br/>To which particular things must melt like snows.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Snows! what are they?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                    Be happier in not knowing<br/>What thy remoter offspring must encounter;<br/>But bask beneath the clime which knows no winter.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But dost thou not love something like thyself?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And dost thou love _thyself_?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                 Yes, but love more<br/>What makes my feelings more endurable,<br/>And is more than myself, because I love it!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thou lovest it, because 'tis beautiful,<br/>As was the apple in thy mother's eye;<br/>And when it ceases to be so, thy love<br/>Will cease, like any other appetite.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Cease to be beautiful! how can that be?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. With time.<br/><br/>_Cain_.               But time has passed, and hitherto<br/>Even Adam and my mother both are fair:<br/>Not fair like Adah and the Seraphim--<br/>But very fair.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     All that must pass away<br/>In them and her.<br/><br/>_Cain_.          I'm sorry for it; but<br/>Cannot conceive my love for her the less:<br/>And when her beauty disappears, methinks<br/>He who creates all beauty will lose more<br/>Than me in seeing perish such a work.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. I pity thee who lovest what must perish.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And I thee who lov'st nothing.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                             And thy brother--<br/>Sits he not near thy heart?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                    Why should he not?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thy father loves him well--so does thy God.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And so do I.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           'Tis well and meekly done.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Meekly!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.      He is the second born of flesh,<br/>And is his mother's favourite.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                        Let him keep<br/>Her favour, since the Serpent was the first<br/>To win it.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And his father's?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      What is that<br/>To me? should I not love that which all love?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And the Jehovah--the indulgent Lord,<br/>And bounteous planter of barred Paradise--<br/>He, too, looks smilingly on Abel.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                           I<br/>Ne'er saw him, and I know not if he smiles.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. But you have seen his angels.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                    Rarely.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                        But<br/>Sufficiently to see they love your brother:<br/>_His_ sacrifices are acceptable.<br/><br/>_Cain_. So be they! wherefore speak to me of this?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Because thou hast thought of this ere now.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                               And if<br/>I _have_ thought, why recall a thought that----<br/>  (_he pauses as agitated_)--Spirit!<br/>_Here_ we are in _thy_ world; speak not of _mine_.<br/>Thou hast shown me wonders: thou hast shown me those<br/>Mighty Pre-Adamites who walked the earth<br/>Of which ours is the wreck: thou hast pointed out<br/>Myriads of starry worlds, of which our own<br/>Is the dim and remote companion, in<br/>Infinity of life: thou hast shown me shadows<br/>Of that existence with the dreaded name<br/>Which my sire brought us--Death; thou hast shown me much<br/>But not all: show me where Jehovah dwells,<br/>In his especial Paradise--or _thine_:<br/>Where is it?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.     _Here_, and o'er all space.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                    But ye<br/>Have some allotted dwelling--as all things;<br/>Clay has its earth, and other worlds their tenants;<br/>All temporary breathing creatures their<br/>Peculiar element; and things which have<br/>Long ceased to breathe _our_ breath, have theirs, thou say'st;<br/>And the Jehovah and thyself have thine--<br/>Ye do not dwell together?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                No, we reign<br/>Together; but our dwellings are asunder.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Would there were only one of ye! perchance<br/>An unity of purpose might make union<br/>In elements which seem now jarred in storms.<br/>How came ye, being Spirits wise and infinite,<br/>To separate? Are ye not as brethren in<br/>Your essence--and your nature, and your glory?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Art not thou Abel's brother?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                 We are brethren,<br/>And so we shall remain; but were it not so,<br/>Is spirit like to flesh? can it fall out--<br/>Infinity with Immortality?<br/>Jarring and turning space to misery--<br/>For what?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. To reign.<br/><br/>_Cain_.              Did ye not tell me that<br/>Ye are both eternal?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.           Yea!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  And what I have seen--<br/>Yon blue immensity, is boundless?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                        Aye.<br/>_Cain_. And cannot ye both _reign_, then?--is there not<br/>Enough?--why should ye differ?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                     We _both_ reign.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But one of you makes evil.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                         Which?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                  Thou! for<br/>If thou canst do man good, why dost thou not?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And why not he who made? _I_ made ye not;<br/>Ye are _his_ creatures, and not mine.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              Then leave us<br/>_His_ creatures, as thou say'st we are, or show me<br/>Thy dwelling, or _his_ dwelling.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                      I could show thee<br/>Both; but the time will come thou shalt see one<br/>Of them for evermore.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                And why not now?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. Thy human mind hath scarcely grasp to gather<br/>The little I have shown thee into calm<br/>And clear thought: and _thou_ wouldst go on aspiring<br/>To the great double Mysteries! the _two Principles_!<br/>And gaze upon them on their secret thrones!<br/>Dust! limit thy ambition; for to see<br/>Either of these would be for thee to perish!<br/><br/>_Cain_. And let me perish, so I see them!<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                There<br/>The son of her who snatched the apple spake!<br/>But thou wouldst only perish, and not see them;<br/>That sight is for the other state.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            Of Death?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. That is the prelude.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                         Then I dread it less,<br/>Now that I know it leads to something definite.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And now I will convey thee to thy world,<br/>Where thou shall multiply the race of Adam,<br/>Eat, drink, toil, tremble, laugh, weep, sleep--and die!<br/><br/>_Cain_. And to what end have I beheld these things<br/>Which thou hast shown me?<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                Didst thou not require<br/>Knowledge? And have I not, in what I showed,<br/>Taught thee to know thyself?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      Alas! I seem<br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_. And this should be the human sum<br/>Of knowledge, to know mortal nature's nothingness;<br/>Bequeath that science to thy children, and<br/>'Twill spare them many tortures.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                          Haughty spirit!<br/>Thou speak'st it proudly; but thyself, though proud,<br/>Hast a superior.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.       No! By heaven, which he<br/>Holds, and the abyss, and the immensity<br/>Of worlds and life, which I hold with him--No!<br/>I have a Victor--true; but no superior.<br/>Homage he has from all--but none from me:<br/>I battle it against him, as I battled<br/>In highest Heaven--through all Eternity,<br/>And the unfathomable gulfs of Hades,<br/>And the interminable realms of space,<br/>And the infinity of endless ages,<br/>All, all, will I dispute! And world by world,<br/>And star by star, and universe by universe,<br/>Shall tremble in the balance, till the great<br/>Conflict shall cease, if ever it shall cease,<br/>Which it ne'er shall, till he or I be quenched!<br/>And what can quench our immortality,<br/>Or mutual and irrevocable hate?<br/>He as a conqueror will call the conquered<br/>_Evil_; but what will be the _Good_ he gives?<br/>Were I the victor, _his_ works would be deemed<br/>The only evil ones. And you, ye new<br/>And scarce-born mortals, what have been his gifts<br/>To you already, in your little world?<br/><br/>_Cain_. But few; and some of those but bitter.<br/><br/>_Lucifer_.                                     Back<br/>With me, then, to thine earth, and try the rest<br/>Of his celestial boons to you and yours.<br/>Evil and Good are things in their own essence,<br/>And not made good or evil by the Giver;<br/>But if he gives you good--so call him; if<br/>Evil springs from _him_, do not name it _mine_,<br/>Till ye know better its true fount; and judge<br/>Not by words, though of Spirits, but the fruits<br/>Of your existence, such as it must be.<br/>_One good_ gift has the fatal apple given,--<br/>Your _reason_:--let it not be overswayed<br/>By tyrannous threats to force you into faith<br/>'Gainst all external sense and inward feeling:<br/>Think and endure,--and form an inner world<br/>In your own bosom--where the outward fails;<br/>So shall you nearer be the spiritual<br/>Nature, and war triumphant with your own.<br/>                                                    [_They disappear_.<br/><br/>ACT III.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_The Earth, near Eden, as in Act I_.<br/><br/>                     _Enter_ CAIN _and_ ADAH.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Hush! tread softly, Cain!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                           I will--but wherefore?<br/><br/>_Adah_. Our little Enoch sleeps upon yon bed<br/>Of leaves, beneath the cypress.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                         Cypress! 'tis<br/>A gloomy tree, which looks as if it mourned<br/>O'er what it shadows; wherefore didst thou choose it<br/>For our child's canopy?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                 Because its branches<br/>Shut out the sun like night, and therefore seemed<br/>Fitting to shadow slumber.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                    Aye, the last--<br/>And longest; but no matter--lead me to him.<br/>                                           [_They go up to the child_.<br/>How lovely he appears! his little cheeks,<br/>In their pure incarnation, vying with<br/>The rose leaves strewn beneath them.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                              And his lips, too,<br/>How beautifully parted! No; you shall not<br/>Kiss him, at least not now: he will awake soon--<br/>His hour of mid-day rest is nearly over;<br/>But it were pity to disturb him till<br/>'Tis closed.<br/><br/>_Cain_.     You have said well; I will contain<br/>My heart till then. He smiles, and sleeps!--sleep on,<br/>And smile, thou little, young inheritor<br/>Of a world scarce less young: sleep on, and smile!<br/>Thine are the hours and days when both are cheering<br/>And innocent! _thou_ hast not plucked the fruit--<br/>Thou know'st not thou art naked! Must the time<br/>Come thou shalt be amerced for sins unknown,<br/>Which were not thine nor mine? But now sleep on!<br/>His cheeks are reddening into deeper smiles,<br/>And shining lids are trembling o'er his long<br/>Lashes, dark as the cypress which waves o'er them;<br/>Half open, from beneath them the clear blue<br/>Laughs out, although in slumber. He must dream--<br/>Of what? Of Paradise!--Aye! dream of it,<br/>My disinherited boy! 'Tis but a dream;<br/>For never more thyself, thy sons, nor fathers,<br/>Shall walk in that forbidden place of joy!<br/><br/>_Adah_. Dear Cain! Nay, do not whisper o'er our son<br/>Such melancholy yearnings o'er the past:<br/>Why wilt thou always mourn for Paradise?<br/>Can we not make another?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                  Where?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                        Here, or<br/>Where'er thou wilt: where'er thou art, I feel not<br/>The want of this so much regretted Eden.<br/>Have I not thee--our boy--our sire, and brother,<br/>And Zillah--our sweet sister, and our Eve,<br/>To whom we owe so much besides our birth?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Yes--Death, too, is amongst the debts we owe her.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Cain! that proud Spirit, who withdrew thee hence,<br/>Hath saddened thine still deeper. I had hoped<br/>The promised wonders which thou hast beheld,<br/>Visions, thou say'st, of past and present worlds,<br/>Would have composed thy mind into the calm<br/>Of a contented knowledge; but I see<br/>Thy guide hath done thee evil: still I thank him,<br/>And can forgive him all, that he so soon<br/>Hath given thee back to us.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                     So soon?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                            'Tis scarcely<br/>Two hours since ye departed: two _long_ hours<br/>To _me_, but only _hours_ upon the sun.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And yet I have approached that sun, and seen<br/>Worlds which he once shone on, and never more<br/>Shall light; and worlds he never lit: methought<br/>Years had rolled o'er my absence.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                           Hardly hours.<br/><br/>_Cain_. The mind then hath capacity of time,<br/>And measures it by that which it beholds,<br/>Pleasing or painful; little or almighty.<br/>I had beheld the immemorial works<br/>Of endless beings; skirred extinguished worlds;<br/>And, gazing on eternity, methought<br/>I had borrowed more by a few drops of ages<br/>From its immensity: but now I feel<br/>My littleness again. Well said the Spirit,<br/>That I was nothing!<br/><br/>_Adah_.             Wherefore said he so?<br/>Jehovah said not that.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                No: _he_ contents him<br/>With making us the _nothing_ which we are;<br/>And after flattering dust with glimpses of<br/>Eden and Immortality, resolves<br/>It back to dust again--for what?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                          Thou know'st--<br/>Even for our parents' error.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      What is that<br/>To us? they sinned, then _let them_ die!<br/><br/>_Adah_. Thou hast not spoken well, nor is that thought<br/>Thy own, but of the Spirit who was with thee.<br/>Would _I_ could die for them, so _they_ might live!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Why, so say I--provided that one victim<br/>Might satiate the Insatiable of life,<br/>And that our little rosy sleeper there<br/>Might never taste of death nor human sorrow,<br/>Nor hand it down to those who spring from him.<br/><br/>_Adah_. How know we that some such atonement one day<br/>May not redeem our race?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                   By sacrificing<br/>The harmless for the guilty? what atonement<br/>Were there? why, _we_ are innocent: what have we<br/>Done, that we must be victims for a deed<br/>Before our birth, or need have victims to<br/>Atone for this mysterious, nameless sin--<br/>If it be such a sin to seek for knowledge?<br/><br/>_Adah_. Alas! thou sinnest now, my Cain: thy words<br/>Sound impious in mine ears.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                     Then leave me!<br/><br/>_Adah_.                                   Never,<br/>Though thy God left thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                   Say, what have we here?<br/><br/>_Adah_. Two altars, which our brother Abel made<br/>During thine absence, whereupon to offer<br/>A sacrifice to God on thy return.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And how knew _he_, that _I_ would be so ready<br/>With the burnt offerings, which he daily brings<br/>With a meek brow, whose base humility<br/>Shows more of fear than worship--as a bribe<br/>To the Creator?<br/><br/>_Adah_.         Surely, 'tis well done.<br/><br/>_Cain_. One altar may suffice; _I_ have no offering.<br/><br/>_Adah_. The fruits of the earth, the early, beautiful,<br/>Blossom and bud--and bloom of flowers and fruits--<br/>These are a goodly offering to the Lord,<br/>Given with a gentle and a contrite spirit.<br/><br/>_Cain_. I have toiled, and tilled, and sweaten in the sun,<br/>According to the curse:--must I do more?<br/>For what should I be gentle? for a war<br/>With all the elements ere they will yield<br/>The bread we eat? For what must I be grateful?<br/>For being dust, and grovelling in the dust,<br/>Till I return to dust? If I am nothing--<br/>For nothing shall I be an hypocrite,<br/>And seem well-pleased with pain? For what should I<br/>Be contrite? for my father's sin, already<br/>Expiate with what we all have undergone,<br/>And to be more than expiated by<br/>The ages prophesied, upon our seed.<br/>Little deems our young blooming sleeper, there,<br/>The germs of an eternal misery<br/>To myriads is within him! better 'twere<br/>I snatched him in his sleep, and dashed him 'gainst<br/>The rocks, than let him live to----<br/><br/>_Adah_.                            Oh, my God!<br/>Touch not the child--my child! _thy_ child! Oh, Cain!<br/><br/>_Cain_. Fear not! for all the stars, and all the power<br/>Which sways them, I would not accost yon infant<br/>With ruder greeting than a father's kiss.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Then, why so awful in thy speech?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                  I said,<br/>'Twere better that he ceased to live, than give<br/>Life to so much of sorrow as he must<br/>Endure, and, harder still, bequeath; but since<br/>That saying jars you, let us only say--<br/>'Twere better that he never had been born.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Oh, do not say so! Where were then the joys,<br/>The mother's joys of watching, nourishing,<br/>And loving him? Soft! he awakes. Sweet Enoch!<br/>                                             [_She goes to the child_.<br/>Oh, Cain! look on him; see how full of life,<br/>Of strength, of bloom, of beauty, and of joy--<br/>How like to me--how like to thee, when gentle--<br/>For _then_ we are _all_ alike; is't not so, Cain?<br/>Mother, and sire, and son, our features are<br/>Reflected in each other; as they are<br/>In the clear waters, when _they_ are _gentle_, and<br/>When _thou_ art _gentle_. Love us, then, my Cain!<br/>And love thyself for our sakes, for we love thee.<br/>Look! how he laughs and stretches out his arms,<br/>And opens wide his blue eyes upon thine,<br/>To hail his father; while his little form<br/>Flutters as winged with joy. Talk not of pain!<br/>The childless cherubs well might envy thee<br/>The pleasures of a parent! Bless him, Cain!<br/>As yet he hath no words to thank thee, but<br/>His heart will, and thine own too.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            Bless thee, boy!<br/>If that a mortal blessing may avail thee,<br/>To save thee from the Serpent's curse!<br/><br/>_Adah_.                              It shall.<br/>Surely a father's blessing may avert<br/>A reptile's subtlety.<br/><br/>_Cain_.             Of that I doubt;<br/>But bless him ne'er the less.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                       Our brother comes.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Thy brother Abel.<br/><br/>                          _Enter_ ABEL.<br/><br/>_Abel_.                   Welcome, Cain! My brother,<br/>The peace of God be on thee!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      Abel, hail!<br/><br/>_Abel_. Our sister tells me that thou hast been wandering,<br/>In high communion with a Spirit, far<br/>Beyond our wonted range. Was he of those<br/>We have seen and spoken with, like to our father?<br/><br/>_Cain_. No.<br/><br/>_Abel_.     Why then commune with him? he may be<br/>A foe to the Most High.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                 And friend to man.<br/>Has the Most High been so--if so you term him?<br/><br/>_Abel_. _Term him!_ your words are strange to-day, my brother.<br/>My sister Adah, leave us for awhile--<br/>We mean to sacrifice.<br/><br/>_Adah_.                  Farewell, my Cain;<br/>But first embrace thy son. May his soft spirit,<br/>And Abel's pious ministry, recall thee<br/>To peace and holiness!                 [_Exit_ ADAH, _with her child_.<br/><br/>_Abel_.                Where hast thou been?<br/><br/>_Cain_. I know not.<br/><br/>_Abel_.             Nor what thou hast seen?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                     The dead--<br/>The Immortal--the Unbounded--the Omnipotent--<br/>The overpowering mysteries of space--<br/>The innumerable worlds that were and are--<br/>A whirlwind of such overwhelming things,<br/>Suns, moons, and earths, upon their loud-voiced spheres<br/>Singing in thunder round me, as have made me<br/>Unfit for mortal converse: leave me, Abel.<br/><br/>_Abel_. Thine eyes are flashing with unnatural light--<br/>Thy cheek is flushed with an unnatural hue--<br/>Thy words are fraught with an unnatural sound--<br/>What may this mean?<br/><br/>_Cain_.            It means--I pray thee, leave me.<br/><br/>_Abel_. Not till we have prayed and sacrificed together.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Abel, I pray thee, sacrifice alone--<br/>Jehovah loves thee well.<br/><br/>_Abel_.                  _Both_ well, I hope.<br/><br/>_Cain_. But thee the better: I care not for that;<br/>Thou art fitter for his worship than I am;<br/>Revere him, then--but let it be alone--<br/>At least, without me.<br/><br/>_Abel_.               Brother, I should ill<br/>Deserve the name of our great father's son,<br/>If, as my elder, I revered thee not,<br/>And in the worship of our God, called not<br/>On thee to join me, and precede me in<br/>Our priesthood--'tis thy place.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                         But I have ne'er<br/>Asserted it.<br/><br/>_Abel_.      The more my grief; I pray thee<br/>To do so now: thy soul seems labouring in<br/>Some strong delusion; it will calm thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                  No;<br/>Nothing can calm me more. _Calm!_ say I? Never<br/>Knew I what calm was in the soul, although<br/>I have seen the elements stilled. My Abel, leave me!<br/>Or let me leave thee to thy pious purpose.<br/><br/>_Abel_. Neither; we must perform our task together.<br/>Spurn me not.<br/><br/>_Cain_.       If it must be so----well, then,<br/>What shall I do?<br/><br/>_Abel_.          Choose one of those two altars.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Choose for me: they to me are so much turf<br/>And stone.<br/><br/>_Abel_.    Choose thou!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                I have chosen.<br/><br/>_Abel_.                              'Tis the highest,<br/>And suits thee, as the elder. Now prepare<br/>Thine offerings.<br/><br/>_Cain_.         Where are thine?<br/><br/>_Abel_.                         Behold them here--<br/>The firstlings of the flock, and fat thereof--<br/>A shepherd's humble offering.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                      I have no flocks;<br/>I am a tiller of the ground, and must<br/>Yield what it yieldeth to my toil--its fruit:<br/>                                                 [_He gathers fruits_.<br/>Behold them in their various bloom and ripeness.<br/>         [_They dress their altars, and kindle aflame upon them_.<br/><br/>_Abel_. My brother, as the elder, offer first<br/>Thy prayer and thanksgiving with sacrifice.<br/><br/>_Cain_. No--I am new to this; lead thou the way,<br/>And I will follow--as I may.<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_kneeling_).       Oh, God!<br/>Who made us, and who breathed the breath of life<br/>Within our nostrils, who hath blessed us,<br/>And spared, despite our father's sin, to make<br/>His children all lost, as they might have been,<br/>Had not thy justice been so tempered with<br/>The mercy which is thy delight, as to<br/>Accord a pardon like a Paradise,<br/>Compared with our great crimes:--Sole Lord of light!<br/>Of good, and glory, and eternity!<br/>Without whom all were evil, and with whom<br/>Nothing can err, except to some good end<br/>Of thine omnipotent benevolence!<br/>Inscrutable, but still to be fulfilled!<br/>Accept from out thy humble first of shepherds'<br/>First of the first-born flocks--an offering,<br/>In itself nothing--as what offering can be<br/>Aught unto thee?--but yet accept it for<br/>The thanksgiving of him who spreads it in<br/>The face of thy high heaven--bowing his own<br/>Even to the dust, of which he is--in honour<br/>Of thee, and of thy name, for evermore!<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_standing erect during this speech_).<br/>Spirit whate'er or whosoe'er thou art,<br/>Omnipotent, it may be--and, if good,<br/>Shown in the exemption of thy deeds from evil;<br/>Jehovah upon earth! and God in heaven!<br/>And it may be with other names, because<br/>Thine attributes seem many, as thy works:--<br/>If thou must be propitiated with prayers,<br/>Take them! If thou must be induced with altars,<br/>And softened with a sacrifice, receive them;<br/>Two beings here erect them unto thee.<br/>If thou lov'st blood, the shepherd's shrine, which smokes<br/>On my right hand, hath shed it for thy service<br/>In the first of his flock, whose limbs now reek<br/>In sanguinary incense to thy skies;<br/>Or, if the sweet and blooming fruits of earth,<br/>And milder seasons, which the unstained turf<br/>I spread them on now offers in the face<br/>Of the broad sun which ripened them, may seem<br/>Good to thee--inasmuch as they have not<br/>Suffered in limb or life--and rather form<br/>A sample of thy works, than supplication<br/>To look on ours! If a shrine without victim,<br/>And altar without gore, may win thy favour,<br/>Look on it! and for him who dresseth it,<br/>He is--such as thou mad'st him; and seeks nothing<br/>Which must be won by kneeling: if he's evil,<br/>Strike him! thou art omnipotent, and may'st--<br/>For what can he oppose? If he be good,<br/>Strike him, or spare him, as thou wilt! since all<br/>Rests upon thee; and Good and Evil seem<br/>To have no power themselves, save in thy will--<br/>And whether that be good or ill I know not,<br/>Not being omnipotent, nor fit to judge<br/>Omnipotence--but merely to endure<br/>Its mandate; which thus far I have endured.<br/><br/>             [_The fire upon the altar of_ ABEL _kindles into a column<br/>                        of the brightest flame, and ascends to heaven;<br/>                           while a whirlwind throws down the altar of_<br/>                                 CAIN, _and scatters the fruits abroad<br/>                                                 upon the earths_<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_kneeling_).<br/>Oh, brother, pray! Jehovah's wroth with thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Why so?<br/><br/>_Abel_.         Thy fruits are scattered on the earth.<br/><br/>_Cain_. From earth they came, to earth let them return;<br/>Their seed will bear fresh fruit there ere the summer:<br/>Thy burnt flesh-offering prospers better; see<br/>How Heaven licks up the flames, when thick with blood!<br/><br/>_Abel_. Think not upon my offering's acceptance,<br/>But make another of thine own--before<br/>It is too late.<br/><br/>_Cain_.        I will build no more altars,<br/>Nor suffer any----<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_rising_). Cain! what meanest thou?<br/><br/>_Cain_. To cast down yon vile flatterer of the clouds,<br/>The smoky harbinger of thy dull prayers--<br/>Thine altar, with its blood of lambs and kids,<br/>Which fed on milk, to be destroyed in blood.<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_opposing him_).<br/>Thou shalt not:--add not impious works to impious<br/>Words! let that altar stand--'tis hallowed now<br/>By the immortal pleasure of Jehovah,<br/>In his acceptance of the victims.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                         _His_!<br/>_His pleasure!_ what was his high pleasure in<br/>The fumes of scorching flesh and smoking blood,<br/>To the pain of the bleating mothers, which<br/>Still yearn for their dead offspring? or the pangs<br/>Of the sad ignorant victims underneath<br/>Thy pious knife? Give way! this bloody record<br/>Shall not stand in the sun, to shame creation!<br/><br/>_Abel_. Brother, give back! thou shalt not touch my altar<br/>With violence: if that thou wilt adopt it,<br/>To try another sacrifice, 'tis thine.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Another sacrifice! Give way, or else<br/>That sacrifice may be----<br/><br/>_Abel_.                   What mean'st thou?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                     Give--<br/>Give way!--thy God loves blood!--then look to it:--<br/>Give way, ere he hath _more_!<br/><br/>_Abel_.                      In _his_ great name,<br/>I stand between thee and the shrine which hath<br/>Had his acceptance.<br/><br/>_Cain_.            If thou lov'st thyself,<br/>Stand back till I have strewed this turf along<br/>Its native soil:--else----<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_opposing him_).   I love God far more<br/>Than life.<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_striking him with a brand, on the temples, which<br/>he snatches from the altar_). Then take thy life unto thy God,<br/>Since he loves lives.<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_falls_). What hast thou done--my brother?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Brother!<br/><br/>_Abel_.          Oh, God! receive thy servant! and<br/>Forgive his slayer, for he knew not what<br/>He did--Cain, give me--give me thy hand; and tell<br/>Poor Zillah--<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_after a moment's stupefaction_).<br/>            _My_ hand! 'tis all red, and with----<br/>What?                          [_A long pause.--Looking slowly round_.<br/>      Where am I? alone! Where's Abel? where<br/>Cain? Can it be that I am he? My brother,<br/>Awake!--why liest thou so long on the green earth?<br/>'Tis not the hour of slumber:--why so pale?<br/>What hast thou!--thou wert full of life this morn!<br/>Abel! I pray thee, mock me not! I smote<br/>Too fiercely, but not fatally. Ah, why<br/>Wouldst thou oppose me? This is mockery;<br/>And only done to daunt me:--'twas a blow--<br/>And but a blow. Stir--stir--nay, only stir!<br/>Why, so--that's well!--thou breathest! breathe upon me!<br/>Oh God! Oh God!<br/><br/>_Abel_ (_very faintly_). What's he who speaks of God?<br/><br/>_Cain_. Thy murderer.<br/><br/>_Abel_.               Then may God forgive him! Cain,<br/>Comfort poor Zillah:--she has but one brother<br/>Now.                                                     [ABEL _dies_.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And I none!--Who makes me brotherless?<br/>His eyes are open! then he is not dead!<br/>Death is like sleep; and sleep shuts down our lids.<br/>His lips, too, are apart; why then he breathes;<br/>And yet I feel it not.--His heart!--his heart!--<br/>Let me see, doth it beat? methinks----No!--no!<br/>This is a vision, else I am become<br/>The native of another and worse world.<br/>The earth swims round me:--what is this?--'tis wet;<br/>                   [_Puts his hand to his brow, and then looks at it_.<br/>And yet there are no dews! 'Tis blood--my blood--<br/>My brother's and my own! and shed by me!<br/>Then what have I further to do with life,<br/>Since I have taken life from my own flesh?<br/>But he can not be dead!--Is silence death?<br/>No; he will wake; then let me watch by him.<br/>Life cannot be so slight, as to be quenched<br/>Thus quickly!--he hath spoken to me since--<br/>What shall I say to him?--My brother!--No:<br/>He will not answer to that name; for brethren<br/>Smite not each other. Yet--yet--speak to me.<br/>Oh! for a word more of that gentle voice,<br/>That I may bear to hear my own again!<br/><br/>                         _Enter_ ZILLAH.<br/><br/>_Zillah_. I heard a heavy sound; what can it be?<br/>'Tis Cain; and watching by my husband. What<br/>Dost thou there, brother? Doth he sleep? Oh, Heaven!<br/>What means this paleness, and yon stream?--No, no!<br/>It is not blood; for who would shed his blood?<br/>Abel! what's this?--who hath done this? He moves not;<br/>He breathes not: and his hands drop down from mine<br/>With stony lifelessness! Ah! cruel Cain!<br/>Why camest thou not in time to save him from<br/>This violence? Whatever hath assailed him,<br/>Thou wert the stronger, and shouldst have stepped in<br/>Between him and aggression! Father!--Eve!--<br/>Adah!--come hither! Death is in the world!<br/>                        [_Exit_ ZILLAH, _calling on her Parents, etc._<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_solus_). And who hath brought him there?--I--who abhor<br/>The name of Death so deeply, that the thought<br/>Empoisoned all my life, before I knew<br/>His aspect--I have led him here, and given<br/>My brother to his cold and still embrace,<br/>As if he would not have asserted his<br/>Inexorable claim without my aid.<br/>I am awake at last--a dreary dream<br/>Had maddened me;--but _he_ shall ne'er awake!<br/><br/>              _Enter_ ADAM, EVE, ADAH, _and_ ZILLAH.<br/><br/>_Adam_. A voice of woe from Zillah brings me here--<br/>What do I see?--'Tis true!--My son!--my son!<br/>Woman, behold the Serpent's work, and thine!                [_To_ EVE.<br/><br/>_Eve_. Oh! speak not of it now: the Serpent's fangs<br/>Are in my heart! My best beloved, Abel!<br/>Jehovah! this is punishment beyond<br/>A mother's sin, to take _him_ from me!<br/><br/>_Adam_.                                     Who,<br/>Or what hath done this deed?--speak, Cain, since thou<br/>Wert present; was it some more hostile angel,<br/>Who walks not with Jehovah? or some wild<br/>Brute of the forest?<br/><br/>_Eve_.               Ah! a livid light<br/>Breaks through, as from a thunder-cloud! yon brand<br/>Massy and bloody! snatched from off the altar,<br/>And black with smoke, and red with----<br/><br/>_Adam_.                               Speak, my son!<br/>Speak, and assure us, wretched as we are,<br/>That we are not more miserable still.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Speak, Cain! and say it was not _thou_!<br/><br/>_Eve_.                                          It was!<br/>I see it now--he hangs his guilty head,<br/>And covers his ferocious eye with hands<br/>Incarnadine!<br/><br/>_Adah_.      Mother, thou dost him wrong--<br/>Cain! clear thee from this horrible accusal,<br/>Which grief wrings from our parent.<br/><br/>_Eve_.                              Hear, Jehovah!<br/>May the eternal Serpent's curse be on him!<br/>For he was fitter for his seed than ours.<br/>May all his days be desolate! May----<br/><br/>_Adah_.

He hath left thee no brother--<br/>Zillah no husband--me _no son!_ for thus<br/>I curse him from my sight for evermore!<br/>All bonds I break between us, as he broke<br/>That of his nature, _in yon_----Oh Death! Death!<br/>Why didst thou not take _me_, who first incurred thee?<br/>Why dost thou not so now?<br/><br/>_Adam_.                   Eve! let not this,<br/>Thy natural grief, lead to impiety!<br/>A heavy doom was long forespoken to us;<br/>And now that it begins, let it be borne<br/>In such sort as may show our God, that we<br/>Are faithful servants to his holy will.<br/><br/>_Eve_ (_pointing to Cain_).<br/>_His will!_ the will of yon Incarnate Spirit<br/>Of Death, whom I have brought upon the earth<br/>To strew it with the dead. May all the curses<br/>Of life be on him! and his agonies<br/>Drive him forth o'er the wilderness, like us<br/>From Eden, till his children do by him<br/>As he did by his brother! May the swords<br/>And wings of fiery Cherubim pursue him<br/>By day and night--snakes spring up in his path--<br/>Earth's fruits be ashes in his mouth--the leaves<br/>On which he lays his head to sleep be strewed<br/>With scorpions! May his dreams be of his victim!<br/>His waking a continual dread of Death!<br/>May the clear rivers turn to blood as he<br/>Stoops down to stain them with his raging lip!<br/>May every element shun or change to him!<br/>May he live in the pangs which others die with!<br/>And Death itself wax something worse than Death<br/>To him who first acquainted him with man!<br/>Hence, fratricide! henceforth that word is _Cain_,<br/>Through all the coming myriads of mankind,<br/>Who shall abhor thee, though thou wert their sire!<br/>May the grass wither from thy feet! the woods<br/>Deny thee shelter! earth a home! the dust<br/>A grave! the sun his light! and heaven her God!<br/>                                                          [_Exit_ EVE.<br/><br/>_Adam_. Cain! get thee forth: we dwell no more together.<br/>Depart! and leave the dead to me--I am<br/>Henceforth alone--we never must meet more.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Oh, part not with him thus, my father: do not<br/>Add thy deep curse to Eve's upon his head!<br/><br/>_Adam_. I curse him not: his spirit be his curse.<br/>Come, Zillah!<br/><br/>_Zillah_.       I must watch my husband's corse.<br/><br/>_Adam_. We will return again, when he is gone<br/>Who hath provided for us this dread office.<br/>Come, Zillah!<br/><br/>_Zillah_.    Yet one kiss on yon pale clay,<br/>And those lips once so warm--my heart! my heart!<br/>                                [_Exeunt_ ADAM _and_ ZILLAH _weeping_.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Cain! thou hast heard, we must go forth. I am ready,<br/>So shall our children be. I will bear Enoch,<br/>And you his sister. Ere the sun declines<br/>Let us depart, nor walk the wilderness<br/>Under the cloud of night.--Nay, speak to me.<br/>To _me--thine own_.<br/><br/>_Cain_.             Leave me!<br/><br/>_Adah_.                      Why, all have left thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And wherefore lingerest thou? Dost thou not fear<br/>To dwell with one who hath done this?<br/><br/>_Adah_.                               I fear<br/>Nothing except to leave thee, much as I<br/>Shrink from the deed which leaves thee brotherless.<br/>I must not speak of this--it is between thee<br/>And the great God.<br/><br/>_A Voice from within exclaims_. Cain! Cain!<br/><br/>_Adah_.                    Hear'st thou that voice?<br/><br/>_The Voice within_. Cain! Cain!<br/><br/>_Adah_.                        It soundeth like an angel's tone.<br/><br/>              _Enter the_ ANGEL _of the Lord_.<br/><br/>_Angel_. Where is thy brother Abel?<br/><br/>_Cain_.                              Am I then<br/>My brother's keeper?<br/><br/>_Angel_.            Cain! what hast thou done?<br/>The voice of thy slain brother's blood cries out,<br/>Even from the ground, unto the Lord!--Now art thou<br/>Cursed from the earth, which opened late her mouth<br/>To drink thy brother's blood from thy rash hand.<br/>Henceforth, when thou shalt till the ground, it shall not<br/>Yield thee her strength; a fugitive shalt thou<br/>Be from this day, and vagabond on earth!<br/><br/>_Adah_. This punishment is more than he can bear.<br/>Behold thou drivest him from the face of earth,<br/>And from the face of God shall he be hid.<br/>A fugitive and vagabond on earth,<br/>'Twill come to pass, that whoso findeth him<br/>Shall slay him.<br/><br/>_Cain_.         Would they could! but who are they<br/>Shall slay me? Where are these on the lone earth<br/>As yet unpeopled?<br/><br/>_Angel_.         Thou hast slain thy brother,<br/>And who shall warrant thee against thy son?<br/><br/>_Adah_. Angel of Light! be merciful, nor say<br/>That this poor aching breast now nourishes<br/>A murderer in my boy, and of his father.<br/><br/>_Angel_. Then he would but be what his father is.<br/>Did not the milk of Eve give nutriment<br/>To him thou now seest so besmeared with blood?<br/>The fratricide might well engender parricides.--<br/>But it shall not be so--the Lord thy God<br/>And mine commandeth me to set his seal<br/>On Cain, so that he may go forth in safety.<br/>Who slayeth Cain, a sevenfold vengeance shall<br/>Be taken on his head. Come hither!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                            What<br/>Wouldst thou with me?<br/><br/>_Angel_.              To mark upon thy brow<br/>Exemption from such deeds as thou hast done.<br/><br/>_Cain_. No, let me die!<br/><br/>_Angel_.                It must not be.<br/>                        [_The_ ANGEL _sets the mark on_ CAIN'S _brow_.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                                It burns<br/>My brow, but nought to that which is within it!<br/>Is there more? let me meet it as I may.<br/><br/>_Angel_. Stern hast thou been and stubborn from the womb,<br/>As the ground thou must henceforth till; but he<br/>Thou slew'st was gentle as the flocks he tended.<br/><br/>_Cain_. After the fall too soon was I begotten;<br/>Ere yet my mother's mind subsided from<br/>The Serpent, and my sire still mourned for Eden.<br/>That which I am, I am; I did not seek<br/>For life, nor did I make myself; but could I<br/>With my own death redeem him from the dust--<br/>And why not so? let him return to day,<br/>And I lie ghastly! so shall be restored<br/>By God the life to him he loved; and taken<br/>From me a being I ne'er loved to bear.<br/><br/>_Angel_. Who shall heal murder? what is done, is done;<br/>Go forth! fulfil thy days! and be thy deeds<br/>Unlike the last!                            [_The_ ANGEL _disappears_.<br/><br/>_Adah_.          He's gone, let us go forth;<br/>I hear our little Enoch cry within<br/>Our bower.<br/><br/>_Cain_.     Ah! little knows he what he weeps for!<br/>And I who have shed blood cannot shed tears!<br/>But the four rivers would not cleanse my soul.<br/>Think'st thou my boy will bear to look on me?<br/><br/>_Adah_. If I thought that he would not, I would----<br/><br/>_Cain_ (_interrupting her_).                        No,<br/>No more of threats: we have had too many of them:<br/>Go to our children--I will follow thee.<br/><br/>_Adah_. I will not leave thee lonely with the dead--<br/>Let us depart together.<br/><br/>_Cain_.                Oh! thou dead<br/>And everlasting witness! whose unsinking<br/>Blood darkens earth and heaven! what thou _now_ art<br/>I know not! but if _thou_ seest what _I_ am,<br/>I think thou wilt forgive him, whom his God<br/>Can ne'er forgive, nor his own soul.--Farewell!<br/>I must not, dare not touch what I have made thee.<br/>I, who sprung from the same womb with thee, drained<br/>The same breast, clasped thee often to my own,<br/>In fondness brotherly and boyish, I<br/>Can never meet thee more, nor even dare<br/>To do that for thee, which thou shouldst have done<br/>For me--compose thy limbs into their grave--<br/>The first grave yet dug for mortality.<br/>But who hath dug that grave? Oh, earth! Oh, earth!<br/>For all the fruits thou hast rendered to me, I<br/>Give thee back this.--Now for the wilderness!<br/>                      [ADAH _stoops down and kisses the body of_ ABEL.<br/><br/>_Adah_. A dreary, and an early doom, my brother,<br/>Has been thy lot! Of all who mourn for thee,<br/>I alone must not weep. My office is<br/>Henceforth to dry up tears, and not to shed them;<br/>But yet of all who mourn, none mourn like me,<br/>Not only for thyself, but him who slew thee.<br/>Now, Cain! I will divide thy burden with thee.<br/><br/>_Cain_. Eastward from Eden will we take our way;<br/>'Tis the most desolate, and suits my steps.<br/><br/>_Adah_. Lead! thou shalt be my guide, and may our God<br/>Be thine! Now let us carry forth our children.<br/><br/>_Cain_. And _he_ who lieth there was childless! I<br/>Have dried the fountain of a gentle race,<br/>Which might have graced his recent marriage couch,<br/>And might have tempered this stern blood of mine,<br/>Uniting with our children Abel's offspring!<br/>O Abel!<br/><br/>_Adah_. Peace be with him!<br/><br/>_Cain_.                    But with _me!_----<br/>                                                            [_Exeunt_.
