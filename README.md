# üíÆ The Revenge Of Hamish by *Sidney Lanier*

<p>
    It was three slim does and a ten-tined buck in the bracken lay;<br/>And all of a sudden the sinister smell of a man,<br/>Awaft on a wind-shift, wavered and ran<br/>Down the hill-side and sifted along through the bracken and passed that way.<br/><br/>Then Nan got a-tremble at nostril; she was the daintiest doe;<br/>In the print of her velvet flank on the velvet fern<br/>She reared, and rounded her ears in turn.<br/>Then the buck leapt up, and his head as a king's to a crown did go<br/><br/>Full high in the breeze, and he stood as if Death had the form of a deer;<br/>And the two slim does long lazily stretching arose,<br/>For their day-dream slowlier came to a close,<br/>Till they woke and were still, breath-bound with waiting and wonder and fear.<br/><br/>Then Alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock, the hounds shot by,<br/>The does and the ten-tined buck made a marvellous bound,<br/>The hounds swept after with never a sound,<br/>But Alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh.<br/><br/>For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild,<br/>And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds<br/>For to drive him the deer to the lower glen-grounds:<br/>"I will kill a red deer," quoth Maclean, "in the sight of the wife<br/>and the child."<br/><br/>So gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand;<br/>But he hurried tall Hamish the henchman ahead: "Go turn," --<br/>Cried Maclean -- "if the deer seek to cross to the burn,<br/>Do thou turn them to me: nor fail, lest thy back be red as thy hand."<br/><br/>Now hard-fortuned Hamish, half blown of his breath with the height<br/>of the hill,<br/>Was white in the face when the ten-tined buck and the does<br/>Drew leaping to burn-ward; huskily rose<br/>His shouts, and his nether lip twitched, and his legs were o'er-weak<br/>for his will.<br/><br/>So the deer darted lightly by Hamish and bounded away to the burn.<br/>But Maclean never bating his watch tarried waiting below<br/>Still Hamish hung heavy with fear for to go<br/>All the space of an hour; then he went, and his face was greenish and stern,<br/><br/>And his eye sat back in the socket, and shrunken the eyeballs shone,<br/>As withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see.<br/>"Now, now, grim henchman, what is't with thee?"<br/>Brake Maclean, and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown.<br/><br/>"Three does and a ten-tined buck made out," spoke Hamish, full mild,<br/>"And I ran for to turn, but my breath it was blown, and they passed;<br/>I was weak, for ye called ere I broke me my fast."<br/>Cried Maclean: "Now a ten-tined buck in the sight of the wife and the child<br/><br/>I had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me a snail's own wrong!"<br/>Then he sounded, and down came kinsmen and clansmen all:<br/>"Ten blows, for ten tine, on his back let fall,<br/>And reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong!"<br/><br/>So Hamish made bare, and took him his strokes; at the last he smiled.<br/>"Now I'll to the burn," quoth Maclean, "for it still may be,<br/>If a slimmer-paunched henchman will hurry with me,<br/>I shall kill me the ten-tined buck for a gift to the wife and the child!"<br/><br/>Then the clansmen departed, by this path and that; and over the hill<br/>Sped Maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame;<br/>And that place of the lashing full quiet became;<br/>And the wife and the child stood sad; and bloody-backed Hamish sat still.<br/><br/>But look! red Hamish has risen; quick about and about turns he.<br/>"There is none betwixt me and the crag-top!" he screams under breath.<br/>Then, livid as Lazarus lately from death,<br/>He snatches the child from the mother, and clambers the crag toward the sea.<br/><br/>Now the mother drops breath; she is dumb, and her heart goes dead for a space,<br/>Till the motherhood, mistress of death, shrieks, shrieks through the glen,<br/>And that place of the lashing is live with men,<br/>And Maclean, and the gillie that told him, dash up in a desperate race.<br/><br/>Not a breath's time for asking; an eye-glance reveals all the tale untold.<br/>They follow mad Hamish afar up the crag toward the sea,<br/>And the lady cries: "Clansmen, run for a fee! --<br/>Yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold<br/><br/>Fast Hamish back from the brink!" -- and ever she flies up the steep,<br/>And the clansmen pant, and they sweat, and they jostle and strain.<br/>But, mother, 'tis vain; but, father, 'tis vain;<br/>Stern Hamish stands bold on the brink, and dangles the child o'er the deep.<br/><br/>Now a faintness falls on the men that run, and they all stand still.<br/>And the wife prays Hamish as if he were God, on her knees,<br/>Crying: "Hamish! O Hamish! but please, but please<br/>For to spare him!" and Hamish still dangles the child, with a wavering will.<br/><br/>On a sudden he turns; with a sea-hawk scream, and a gibe, and a song,<br/>Cries: "So; I will spare ye the child if, in sight of ye all,<br/>Ten blows on Maclean's bare back shall fall,<br/>And ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong!"<br/><br/>Then Maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red,<br/>Breathed short for a space, said: "Nay, but it never shall be!<br/>Let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea!"<br/>But the wife: "Can Hamish go fish us the child from the sea, if dead?<br/><br/>Say yea! -- Let them lash ME, Hamish?" -- "Nay!" -- "Husband,<br/>the lashing will heal;<br/>But, oh, who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave?<br/>Could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave?<br/>Quick! Love! I will bare thee -- so -- kneel!" Then Maclean 'gan slowly<br/>to kneel<br/><br/>With never a word, till presently downward he jerked to the earth.<br/>Then the henchman -- he that smote Hamish -- would tremble and lag;<br/>"Strike, hard!" quoth Hamish, full stern, from the crag;<br/>Then he struck him, and "One!" sang Hamish, and danced with the child<br/>in his mirth.<br/><br/>And no man spake beside Hamish; he counted each stroke with a song.<br/>When the last stroke fell, then he moved him a pace down the height,<br/>And he held forth the child in the heartaching sight<br/>Of the mother, and looked all pitiful grave, as repenting a wrong.<br/><br/>And there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayer --<br/>And there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace,<br/>Till her finger nigh felt of the bairnie's face --<br/>In a flash fierce Hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air,<br/><br/>And sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea,<br/>Shrill screeching, "Revenge!" in the wind-rush; and pallid Maclean,<br/>Age-feeble with anger and impotent pain,<br/>Crawled up on the crag, and lay flat, and locked hold of dead roots<br/>of a tree --<br/><br/>And gazed hungrily o'er, and the blood from his back drip-dripped<br/>in the brine,<br/>And a sea-hawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew,<br/>And the mother stared white on the waste of blue,<br/>And the wind drove a cloud to seaward, and the sun began to shine.
