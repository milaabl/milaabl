# üíÆ Mazeppa by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    'Twas after dread Pultowa's day,<br/>  When Fortune left the royal Swede--<br/>Around a slaughtered army lay,<br/>  No more to combat and to bleed.<br/>The power and glory of the war,<br/>  Faithless as their vain votaries, men,<br/>Had passed to the triumphant Czar,<br/>  And Moscow's walls were safe again--<br/>Until a day more dark and drear,<br/>And a more memorable year,<br/>Should give to slaughter and to shame<br/>A mightier host and haughtier name;<br/>A greater wreck, a deeper fall,<br/>A shock to one--a thunderbolt to all.<br/><br/>Such was the hazard of the die;<br/>The wounded Charles was taught to fly<br/>By day and night through field and flood,<br/>Stained with his own and subjects' blood;<br/>For thousands fell that flight to aid:<br/>And not a voice was heard to upbraid<br/>Ambition in his humbled hour,<br/>When Truth had nought to dread from Power.<br/>His horse was slain, and Gieta gave<br/>His own--and died the Russians' slave.<br/>This, too, sinks after many a league<br/>Of well-sustained, but vain fatigue;<br/>And in the depth of forests darkling,<br/>The watch-fires in the distance sparkling--<br/>  The beacons of surrounding foes--<br/>A King must lay his limbs at length.<br/>  Are these the laurels and repose<br/>For which the nations strain their strength?<br/>They laid him by a savage tree,<br/>In outworn Nature's agony;<br/>His wounds were stiff, his limbs were stark;<br/>The heavy hour was chill and dark;<br/>The fever in his blood forbade<br/>A transient slumber's fitful aid:<br/>And thus it was; but yet through all,<br/>Kinglike the monarch bore his fall,<br/>And made, in this extreme of ill,<br/>His pangs the vassals of his will:<br/>All silent and subdued were they.<br/>As once the nations round him lay.<br/><br/>A band of chiefs!--alas! how few,<br/>  Since but the fleeting of a day<br/>Had thinned it; but this wreck was true<br/>  And chivalrous: upon the clay<br/>Each sate him down, all sad and mute,<br/>  Beside his monarch and his steed;<br/>For danger levels man and brute,<br/>  And all are fellows in their need.<br/>Among the rest, Mazeppa made<br/>His pillow in an old oak's shade--<br/>Himself as rough, and scarce less old,<br/>The Ukraine's Hetman, calm and bold;<br/>But first, outspent with this long course,<br/>The Cossack prince rubbed down his horse,<br/>And made for him a leafy bed,<br/>  And smoothed his fetlocks and his mane,<br/>  And slacked his girth, and stripped his rein,<br/>And joyed to see how well he fed;<br/>For until now he had the dread<br/>His wearied courser might refuse<br/>To browse beneath the midnight dews:<br/>But he was hardy as his lord,<br/>And little cared for bed and board;<br/>But spirited and docile too,<br/>Whate'er was to be done, would do.<br/>Shaggy and swift, and strong of limb,<br/>All Tartar-like he carried him;<br/>Obeyed his voice, and came to call,<br/>And knew him in the midst of all:<br/>Though thousands were around,--and Night,<br/>Without a star, pursued her flight,--<br/>That steed from sunset until dawn<br/>His chief would follow like a fawn.<br/><br/>This done, Mazeppa spread his cloak,<br/>And laid his lance beneath his oak,<br/>Felt if his arms in order good<br/>The long day's march had well withstood--<br/>If still the powder filled the pan,<br/>  And flints unloosened kept their lock--<br/>His sabre's hilt and scabbard felt,<br/>And whether they had chafed his belt;<br/>And next the venerable man,<br/>From out his havresack and can,<br/>  Prepared and spread his slender stock;<br/>And to the Monarch and his men<br/>The whole or portion offered then<br/>With far less of inquietude<br/>Than courtiers at a banquet would.<br/>And Charles of this his slender share<br/>With smiles partook a moment there,<br/>To force of cheer a greater show,<br/>And seem above both wounds and woe;--<br/>And then he said--"Of all our band,<br/>Though firm of heart and strong of hand,<br/>In skirmish, march, or forage, none<br/>Can less have said or more have done<br/>Than thee, Mazeppa! On the earth<br/>So fit a pair had never birth,<br/>Since Alexander's days till now,<br/>As thy Bucephalus and thou:<br/>All Scythia's fame to thine should yield<br/>For pricking on o'er flood and field."<br/>Mazeppa answered--"Ill betide<br/>The school wherein I learned to ride!"<br/>Quoth Charles--"Old Hetman, wherefore so,<br/>Since thou hast learned the art so well?"<br/>Mazeppa said--"'Twere long to tell;<br/>And we have many a league to go,<br/>With every now and then a blow,<br/>And ten to one at least the foe,<br/>Before our steeds may graze at ease,<br/>Beyond the swift Borysthenes:<br/>And, Sire, your limbs have need of rest,<br/>And I will be the sentinel<br/>Of this your troop."--"But I request,"<br/>Said Sweden's monarch, "thou wilt tell<br/>This tale of thine, and I may reap,<br/>Perchance, from this the boon of sleep;<br/>For at this moment from my eyes<br/>The hope of present slumber flies."<br/><br/>"Well, Sire, with such a hope, I'll track<br/>My seventy years of memory back:<br/>I think 'twas in my twentieth spring,--<br/>Aye 'twas,--when Casimir was king--<br/>John Casimir,--I was his page<br/>Six summers, in my earlier age:<br/>A learn√©d monarch, faith! was he,<br/>And most unlike your Majesty;<br/>He made no wars, and did not gain<br/>New realms to lose them back again;<br/>And (save debates in Warsaw's diet)<br/>He reigned in most unseemly quiet;<br/>Not that he had no cares to vex;<br/>He loved the Muses and the Sex;<br/>And sometimes these so froward are,<br/>They made him wish himself at war;<br/>But soon his wrath being o'er, he took<br/>Another mistress--or new book:<br/>And then he gave prodigious fetes--<br/>All Warsaw gathered round his gates<br/>To gaze upon his splendid court,<br/>And dames, and chiefs, of princely port.<br/>He was the Polish Solomon,<br/>So sung his poets, all but one,<br/>Who, being unpensioned, made a satire,<br/>And boasted that he could not flatter.<br/>It was a court of jousts and mimes,<br/>Where every courtier tried at rhymes;<br/>Even I for once produced some verses,<br/>And signed my odes 'Despairing Thyrsis.'<br/>There was a certain Palatine,<br/>  A Count of far and high descent,<br/>Rich as a salt or silver mine;<br/>And he was proud, ye may divine,<br/>  As if from Heaven he had been sent;<br/>He had such wealth in blood and ore<br/>  As few could match beneath the throne;<br/>And he would gaze upon his store,<br/>And o'er his pedigree would pore,<br/>Until by some confusion led,<br/>Which almost looked like want of head,<br/>  He thought their merits were his own.<br/>His wife was not of this opinion;<br/>  His junior she by thirty years,<br/>Grew daily tired of his dominion;<br/>  And, after wishes, hopes, and fears,<br/>  To Virtue a few farewell tears,<br/>A restless dream or two--some glances<br/>At Warsaw's youth--some songs, and dances,<br/>Awaited but the usual chances,<br/>Those happy accidents which render<br/>The coldest dames so very tender,<br/>To deck her Count with titles given,<br/>'Tis said, as passports into Heaven;<br/>But, strange to say, they rarely boast<br/>Of these, who have deserved them most.<br/><br/>"I was a goodly stripling then;<br/>  At seventy years I so may say,<br/>That there were few, or boys or men,<br/>  Who, in my dawning time of day,<br/>Of vassal or of knight's degree,<br/>Could vie in vanities with me;<br/>For I had strength--youth--gaiety,<br/>A port, not like to this ye see,<br/>But smooth, as all is rugged now;<br/>  For Time, and Care, and War, have ploughed<br/>My very soul from out my brow;<br/>  And thus I should be disavowed<br/>By all my kind and kin, could they<br/>Compare my day and yesterday;<br/>This change was wrought, too, long ere age<br/>Had ta'en my features for his page:<br/>With years, ye know, have not declined<br/>My strength--my courage--or my mind,<br/>Or at this hour I should not be<br/>Telling old tales beneath a tree,<br/>With starless skies my canopy.<br/>  But let me on: Theresa's form--<br/>Methinks it glides before me now,<br/>Between me and yon chestnut's bough,<br/>  The memory is so quick and warm;<br/>And yet I find no words to tell<br/>The shape of her I loved so well:<br/>She had the Asiatic eye,<br/>  Such as our Turkish neighbourhood<br/>  Hath mingled with our Polish blood,<br/>Dark as above us is the sky;<br/>But through it stole a tender light,<br/>Like the first moonrise of midnight;<br/>Large, dark, and swimming in the stream,<br/>Which seemed to melt to its own beam;<br/>All love, half languor, and half fire,<br/>Like saints that at the stake expire,<br/>And lift their raptured looks on high,<br/>As though it were a joy to die.<br/>A brow like a midsummer lake,<br/>  Transparent with the sun therein,<br/>When waves no murmur dare to make,<br/>  And heaven beholds her face within.<br/>A cheek and lip--but why proceed?<br/>  I loved her then, I love her still;<br/>And such as I am, love indeed<br/>  In fierce extremes--in good and ill.<br/>But still we love even in our rage,<br/>And haunted to our very age<br/>With the vain shadow of the past,--<br/>As is Mazeppa to the last.<br/><br/>"We met--we gazed--I saw, and sighed;<br/>She did not speak, and yet replied;<br/>There are ten thousand tones and signs<br/>We hear and see, but none defines--<br/>Involuntary sparks of thought,<br/>Which strike from out the heart o'erwrought,<br/>And form a strange intelligence,<br/>Alike mysterious and intense,<br/>Which link the burning chain that binds,<br/>Without their will, young hearts and minds;<br/>Conveying, as the electric wire,<br/>We know not how, the absorbing fire.<br/>I saw, and sighed--in silence wept,<br/>And still reluctant distance kept,<br/>Until I was made known to her,<br/>And we might then and there confer<br/>Without suspicion--then, even then,<br/>  I longed, and was resolved to speak;<br/>But on my lips they died again,<br/>  The accents tremulous and weak,<br/>Until one hour.--There is a game,<br/>  A frivolous and foolish play,<br/>  Wherewith we while away the day;<br/>It is--I have forgot the name--<br/>And we to this, it seems, were set,<br/>By some strange chance, which I forget:<br/>I recked not if I won or lost,<br/>  It was enough for me to be<br/>  So near to hear, and oh! to see<br/>The being whom I loved the most.<br/>I watched her as a sentinel,<br/>(May ours this dark night watch as well!)<br/>  Until I saw, and thus it was,<br/>That she was pensive, nor perceived<br/>Her occupation, nor was grieved<br/>Nor glad to lose or gain; but still<br/>Played on for hours, as if her will<br/>Yet bound her to the place, though not<br/>That hers might be the winning lot.<br/>  Then through my brain the thought did pass,<br/>Even as a flash of lightning there,<br/>That there was something in her air<br/>Which would not doom me to despair;<br/>And on the thought my words broke forth,<br/>  All incoherent as they were;<br/>Their eloquence was little worth,<br/>But yet she listened--'tis enough--<br/>  Who listens once will listen twice;<br/>  Her heart, be sure, is not of ice--<br/>And one refusal no rebuff.<br/><br/>"I loved, and was beloved again--<br/>  They tell me, Sire, you never knew<br/>  Those gentle frailties; if 'tis true,<br/>I shorten all my joy or pain;<br/>To you 'twould seem absurd as vain;<br/>But all men are not born to reign,<br/>Or o'er their passions, or as you<br/>Thus o'er themselves and nations too.<br/>I am--or rather _was_--a Prince,<br/>  A chief of thousands, and could lead<br/>  Them on where each would foremost bleed;<br/>But could not o'er myself evince<br/>The like control--But to resume:<br/>  I loved, and was beloved again;<br/>In sooth, it is a happy doom,<br/>  But yet where happiest ends in pain.--<br/>We met in secret, and the hour<br/>Which led me to that lady's bower<br/>Was fiery Expectation's dower.<br/>My days and nights were nothing--all<br/>Except that hour which doth recall,<br/>In the long lapse from youth to age,<br/>  No other like itself: I'd give<br/>  The Ukraine back again to live<br/>It o'er once more, and be a page,<br/>The happy page, who was the lord<br/>Of one soft heart, and his own sword,<br/>And had no other gem nor wealth,<br/>Save Nature's gift of Youth and Health.<br/>We met in secret--doubly sweet,<br/>Some say, they find it so to meet;<br/>I know not that--I would have given<br/>  My life but to have called her mine<br/>In the full view of Earth and Heaven;<br/>  For I did oft and long repine<br/>That we could only meet by stealth.<br/><br/>"For lovers there are many eyes,<br/>  And such there were on us; the Devil<br/>  On such occasions should be civil--<br/>The Devil!--I'm loth to do him wrong,<br/>  It might be some untoward saint,<br/>Who would not be at rest too long,<br/>  But to his pious bile gave vent--<br/>But one fair night, some lurking spies<br/>Surprised and seized us both.<br/>The Count was something more than wroth--<br/>I was unarmed; but if in steel,<br/>All cap-√†-pie from head to heel,<br/>What 'gainst their numbers could I do?<br/>'Twas near his castle, far away<br/>  From city or from succour near,<br/>And almost on the break of day;<br/>I did not think to see another,<br/>  My moments seemed reduced to few;<br/>And with one prayer to Mary Mother,<br/>  And, it may be, a saint or two,<br/>As I resigned me to my fate,<br/>They led me to the castle gate:<br/>  Theresa's doom I never knew,<br/>Our lot was henceforth separate.<br/>An angry man, ye may opine,<br/>Was he, the proud Count Palatine;<br/>And he had reason good to be,<br/>  But he was most enraged lest such<br/>  An accident should chance to touch<br/>Upon his future pedigree;<br/>Nor less amazed, that such a blot<br/>His noble 'scutcheon should have got,<br/>While he was highest of his line;<br/>  Because unto himself he seemed<br/>  The first of men, nor less he deemed<br/>In others' eyes, and most in mine.<br/>'Sdeath! with a _page_--perchance a king<br/>Had reconciled him to the thing;<br/>But with a stripling of a page--<br/>I felt--but cannot paint his rage.<br/><br/>"'Bring forth the horse!'--the horse was brought!<br/>In truth, he was a noble steed,<br/>  A Tartar of the Ukraine breed,<br/>Who looked as though the speed of thought<br/>Were in his limbs; but he was wild,<br/>  Wild as the wild deer, and untaught,<br/>With spur and bridle undefiled--<br/>  'Twas but a day he had been caught;<br/>And snorting, with erected mane,<br/>And struggling fiercely, but in vain,<br/>In the full foam of wrath and dread<br/>To me the desert-born was led:<br/>They bound me on, that menial throng,<br/>Upon his back with many a thong;<br/>They loosed him with a sudden lash--<br/>Away!--away!--and on we dash!--<br/>Torrents less rapid and less rash.<br/><br/>"Away!--away!--My breath was gone,<br/>I saw not where he hurried on:<br/>'Twas scarcely yet the break of day,<br/>And on he foamed--away!--away!<br/>The last of human sounds which rose,<br/>As I was darted from my foes,<br/>Was the wild shout of savage laughter,<br/>Which on the wind came roaring after<br/>A moment from that rabble rout:<br/>With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,<br/>  And snapped the cord, which to the mane<br/>  Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,<br/>And, writhing half my form about,<br/>Howled back my curse; but 'midst the tread,<br/>The thunder of my courser's speed,<br/>Perchance they did not hear nor heed:<br/>It vexes me--for I would fain<br/>Have paid their insult back again.<br/>I paid it well in after days:<br/>There is not of that castle gate,<br/>Its drawbridge and portcullis' weight,<br/>Stone--bar--moat--bridge--or barrier left;<br/>Nor of its fields a blade of grass,<br/>  Save what grows on a ridge of wall,<br/>  Where stood the hearth-stone of the hall;<br/>And many a time ye there might pass,<br/>Nor dream that e'er the fortress was.<br/>I saw its turrets in a blaze,<br/>Their crackling battlements all cleft,<br/>  And the hot lead pour down like rain<br/>From off the scorched and blackening roof,<br/>Whose thickness was not vengeance-proof.<br/>  They little thought that day of pain,<br/>When launched, as on the lightning's flash,<br/>They bade me to destruction dash,<br/>  That one day I should come again,<br/>With twice five thousand horse, to thank<br/>  The Count for his uncourteous ride.<br/>They played me then a bitter prank,<br/>  When, with the wild horse for my guide,<br/>They bound me to his foaming flank:<br/>At length I played them one as frank--<br/>For Time at last sets all things even--<br/>  And if we do but watch the hour,<br/>  There never yet was human power<br/>Which could evade, if unforgiven,<br/>The patient search and vigil long<br/>Of him who treasures up a wrong.<br/><br/>"Away!--away!--my steed and I,<br/>  Upon the pinions of the wind!<br/>  All human dwellings left behind,<br/>We sped like meteors through the sky,<br/>When with its crackling sound the night<br/>Is chequered with the Northern light.<br/>Town--village--none were on our track,<br/>  But a wild plain of far extent,<br/>And bounded by a forest black;<br/>  And, save the scarce seen battlement<br/>On distant heights of some strong hold,<br/>Against the Tartars built of old,<br/>No trace of man. The year before<br/>A Turkish army had marched o'er;<br/>And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod,<br/>The verdure flies the bloody sod:<br/>The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,<br/>  And a low breeze crept moaning by--<br/>  I could have answered with a sigh--<br/>But fast we fled,--away!--away!--<br/>And I could neither sigh nor pray;<br/>And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain<br/>Upon the courser's bristling mane;<br/>But, snorting still with rage and fear,<br/>He flew upon his far career:<br/>At times I almost thought, indeed,<br/>He must have slackened in his speed;<br/>But no--my bound and slender frame<br/>  Was nothing to his angry might,<br/>And merely like a spur became:<br/>Each motion which I made to free<br/>My swoln limbs from their agony<br/>  Increased his fury and affright:<br/>I tried my voice,--'twas faint and low--<br/>But yet he swerved as from a blow;<br/>And, starting to each accent, sprang<br/>As from a sudden trumpet's clang:<br/>Meantime my cords were wet with gore,<br/>Which, oozing through my limbs, ran o'er;<br/>And in my tongue the thirst became<br/>A something fierier far than flame.<br/><br/>"We neared the wild wood--'twas so wide,<br/>I saw no bounds on either side:<br/>'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,<br/>That bent not to the roughest breeze<br/>Which howls down from Siberia's waste,<br/>And strips the forest in its haste,--<br/>But these were few and far between,<br/>Set thick with shrubs more young and green,<br/>Luxuriant with their annual leaves,<br/>Ere strown by those autumnal eyes<br/>That nip the forest's foliage dead,<br/>Discoloured with a lifeless red,<br/>Which stands thereon like stiffened gore<br/>Upon the slain when battle's o'er;<br/>And some long winter's night hath shed<br/>Its frost o'er every tombless head--<br/>So cold and stark--the raven's beak<br/>May peck unpierced each frozen cheek:<br/>'Twas a wild waste of underwood,<br/>And here and there a chestnut stood,<br/>The strong oak, and the hardy pine;<br/>  But far apart--and well it were,<br/>Or else a different lot were mine--<br/>  The boughs gave way, and did not tear<br/>My limbs; and I found strength to bear<br/>My wounds, already scarred with cold;<br/>My bonds forbade to loose my hold.<br/>We rustled through the leaves like wind,--<br/>Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;<br/>By night I heard them on the track,<br/>Their troop came hard upon our back,<br/>With their long gallop, which can tire<br/>The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:<br/>Where'er we flew they followed on,<br/>Nor left us with the morning sun;<br/>Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,<br/>At day-break winding through the wood,<br/>And through the night had heard their feet<br/>Their stealing, rustling step repeat.<br/>Oh! how I wished for spear or sword,<br/>At least to die amidst the horde,<br/>And perish--if it must be so--<br/>At bay, destroying many a foe!<br/>When first my courser's race begun,<br/>I wished the goal already won;<br/>But now I doubted strength and speed:<br/>Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed<br/>Had nerved him like the mountain-roe--<br/>Nor faster falls the blinding snow<br/>Which whelms the peasant near the door<br/>Whose threshold he shall cross no more,<br/>Bewildered with the dazzling blast,<br/>Than through the forest-paths he passed--<br/>Untired, untamed, and worse than wild--<br/>All furious as a favoured child<br/>Balked of its wish; or--fiercer still--<br/>A woman piqued--who has her will!<br/><br/>"The wood was passed; 'twas more than noon,<br/>But chill the air, although in June;<br/>Or it might be my veins ran cold--<br/>Prolonged endurance tames the bold;<br/>And I was then not what I seem,<br/>But headlong as a wintry stream,<br/>And wore my feelings out before<br/>I well could count their causes o'er:<br/>And what with fury, fear, and wrath,<br/>The tortures which beset my path--<br/>Cold--hunger--sorrow--shame--distress--<br/>Thus bound in Nature's nakedness;<br/>Sprung from a race whose rising blood<br/>When stirred beyond its calmer mood,<br/>And trodden hard upon, is like<br/>The rattle-snake's, in act to strike--<br/>What marvel if this worn-out trunk<br/>Beneath its woes a moment sunk?<br/>The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,<br/>I seemed to sink upon the ground;<br/>But erred--for I was fastly bound.<br/>My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,<br/>And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:<br/>The skies spun like a mighty wheel;<br/>I saw the trees like drunkards reel,<br/>And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,<br/>Which saw no farther. He who dies<br/>Can die no more than then I died,<br/>O'ertortured by that ghastly ride.<br/>I felt the blackness come and go,<br/>  And strove to wake; but could not make<br/>My senses climb up from below:<br/>I felt as on a plank at sea,<br/>When all the waves that dash o'er thee,<br/>At the same time upheave and whelm,<br/>And hurl thee towards a desert realm.<br/>My undulating life was as<br/>The fancied lights that flitting pass<br/>Our shut eyes in deep midnight, when<br/>Fever begins upon the brain;<br/>But soon it passed, with little pain,<br/>  But a confusion worse than such:<br/>  I own that I should deem it much,<br/>Dying, to feel the same again;<br/>And yet I do suppose we must<br/>Feel far more ere we turn to dust!<br/>No matter! I have bared my brow<br/>Full in Death's face--before--and now.<br/><br/>"My thoughts came back. Where was I? Cold,<br/>  And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse<br/>Life reassumed its lingering hold,<br/>And throb by throb,--till grown a pang<br/>  Which for a moment would convulse,<br/>  My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;<br/>My ear with uncouth noises rang,<br/>  My heart began once more to thrill;<br/>My sight returned, though dim; alas!<br/>And thickened, as it were, with glass.<br/>Methought the dash of waves was nigh;<br/>There was a gleam too of the sky,<br/>Studded with stars;--it is no dream;<br/>The wild horse swims the wilder stream!<br/>The bright broad river's gushing tide<br/>Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,<br/>And we are half-way, struggling o'er<br/>To yon unknown and silent shore.<br/>The waters broke my hollow trance,<br/>And with a temporary strength<br/>  My stiffened limbs were rebaptized.<br/>My courser's broad breast proudly braves,<br/>And dashes off the ascending waves,<br/>And onward we advance!<br/>We reach the slippery shore at length,<br/>  A haven I but little prized,<br/>For all behind was dark and drear,<br/>And all before was night and fear.<br/>How many hours of night or day<br/>In those suspended pangs I lay,<br/>I could not tell; I scarcely knew<br/>If this were human breath I drew.<br/><br/>"With glossy skin, and dripping mane,<br/>  And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,<br/>The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain<br/>  Up the repelling bank.<br/>We gain the top: a boundless plain<br/>Spreads through the shadow of the night,<br/>  And onward, onward, onward--seems,<br/>  Like precipices in our dreams,<br/>To stretch beyond the sight;<br/>And here and there a speck of white,<br/>  Or scattered spot of dusky green,<br/>In masses broke into the light,<br/>As rose the moon upon my right:<br/>  But nought distinctly seen<br/>In the dim waste would indicate<br/>The omen of a cottage gate;<br/>No twinkling taper from afar<br/>Stood like a hospitable star;<br/>Not even an ignis-fatuus rose<br/>To make him merry with my woes:<br/>  That very cheat had cheered me then!<br/>Although detected, welcome still,<br/>Reminding me, through every ill,<br/>  Of the abodes of men.<br/><br/>"Onward we went--but slack and slow;<br/>  His savage force at length o'erspent,<br/>The drooping courser, faint and low,<br/>  All feebly foaming went:<br/>A sickly infant had had power<br/>To guide him forward in that hour!<br/>  But, useless all to me,<br/>His new-born tameness nought availed--<br/>My limbs were bound; my force had failed,<br/>  Perchance, had they been free.<br/>With feeble effort still I tried<br/>To rend the bonds so starkly tied,<br/>  But still it was in vain;<br/>My limbs were only wrung the more,<br/>And soon the idle strife gave o'er,<br/>  Which but prolonged their pain.<br/>The dizzy race seemed almost done,<br/>Although no goal was nearly won:<br/>Some streaks announced the coming sun--<br/>  How slow, alas! he came!<br/>Methought that mist of dawning gray<br/>Would never dapple into day,<br/>How heavily it rolled away!<br/>  Before the eastern flame<br/>Rose crimson, and deposed the stars,<br/>And called the radiance from their cars,<br/>And filled the earth, from his deep throne,<br/>With lonely lustre, all his own.<br/><br/>"Uprose the sun; the mists were curled<br/>Back from the solitary world<br/>Which lay around--behind--before.<br/>What booted it to traverse o'er<br/>Plain--forest--river? Man nor brute,<br/>Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,<br/>Lay in the wild luxuriant soil--<br/>No sign of travel, none of toil--<br/>The very air was mute:<br/>And not an insect's shrill small horn,<br/>Nor matin bird's new voice was borne<br/>From herb nor thicket. Many a _werst,_<br/>Panting as if his heart would burst,<br/>The weary brute still staggered on;<br/>And still we were--or seemed--alone:<br/>At length, while reeling on our way,<br/>Methought I heard a courser neigh,<br/>From out yon tuft of blackening firs.<br/>Is it the wind those branches stirs?<br/>No, no! from out the forest prance<br/>  A trampling troop; I see them come!<br/>In one vast squadron they advance!<br/>  I strove to cry--my lips were dumb!<br/>The steeds rush on in plunging pride;<br/>But where are they the reins to guide?<br/>A thousand horse, and none to ride!<br/>With flowing tail, and flying mane,<br/>Wide nostrils never stretched by pain,<br/>Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,<br/>And feet that iron never shod,<br/>And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,<br/>A thousand horse, the wild, the free,<br/>Like waves that follow o'er the sea,<br/>  Came thickly thundering on,<br/>As if our faint approach to meet!<br/>The sight re-nerved my courser's feet,<br/>A moment staggering, feebly fleet,<br/>A moment, with a faint low neigh,<br/>  He answered, and then fell!<br/>With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,<br/>  And reeking limbs immoveable,<br/>    His first and last career is done!<br/>On came the troop--they saw him stoop,<br/>  They saw me strangely bound along<br/>  His back with many a bloody thong.<br/>They stop--they start--they snuff the air,<br/>Gallop a moment here and there,<br/>Approach, retire, wheel round and round,<br/>Then plunging back with sudden bound,<br/>Headed by one black mighty steed,<br/>Who seemed the Patriarch of his breed,<br/>  Without a single speck or hair<br/>Of white upon his shaggy hide;<br/>They snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,<br/>And backward to the forest fly,<br/>By instinct, from a human eye.<br/>  They left me there to my despair,<br/>Linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,<br/>Whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,<br/>Relieved from that unwonted weight,<br/>From whence I could not extricate<br/>Nor him nor me--and there we lay,<br/>  The dying on the dead!<br/>I little deemed another day<br/>  Would see my houseless, helpless head.<br/><br/>"And there from morn to twilight bound,<br/>I felt the heavy hours toil round,<br/>With just enough of life to see<br/>My last of suns go down on me,<br/>In hopeless certainty of, mind,<br/>That makes us feel at length resigned<br/>To that which our foreboding years<br/>Present the worst and last of fears:<br/>Inevitable--even a boon,<br/>Nor more unkind for coming soon,<br/>Yet shunned and dreaded with such care,<br/>As if it only were a snare<br/>  That Prudence might escape:<br/>At times both wished for and implored,<br/>At times sought with self-pointed sword,<br/>Yet still a dark and hideous close<br/>To even intolerable woes,<br/>  And welcome in no shape.<br/>And, strange to say, the sons of pleasure,<br/>They who have revelled beyond measure<br/>In beauty, wassail, wine, and treasure,<br/>Die calm, or calmer, oft than he<br/>Whose heritage was Misery.<br/>For he who hath in turn run through<br/>All that was beautiful and new,<br/>  Hath nought to hope, and nought to leave;<br/>And, save the future, (which is viewed<br/>Not quite as men are base or good,<br/>But as their nerves may be endued,)<br/>  With nought perhaps to grieve:<br/>The wretch still hopes his woes must end,<br/>And Death, whom he should deem his friend,<br/>Appears, to his distempered eyes,<br/>Arrived to rob him of his prize,<br/>The tree of his new Paradise.<br/>To-morrow would have given him all,<br/>Repaid his pangs, repaired his fall;<br/>To-morrow would have been the first<br/>Of days no more deplored or curst,<br/>But bright, and long, and beckoning years,<br/>Seen dazzling through the mist of tears,<br/>Guerdon of many a painful hour;<br/>To-morrow would have given him power<br/>To rule--to shine--to smite--to save--<br/>And must it dawn upon his grave?<br/><br/>"The sun was sinking--still I lay<br/>  Chained to the chill and stiffening steed!<br/>I thought to mingle there our clay;<br/>  And my dim eyes of death had need,<br/>  No hope arose of being freed.<br/>I cast my last looks up the sky,<br/>  And there between me and the sun<br/>I saw the expecting raven fly,<br/>Who scarce would wait till both should die,<br/>  Ere his repast begun;<br/>He flew, and perched, then flew once more,<br/>And each time nearer than before;<br/>I saw his wing through twilight flit,<br/>And once so near me he alit<br/>  I could have smote, but lacked the strength;<br/>But the slight motion of my hand,<br/>And feeble scratching of the sand,<br/>The exerted throat's faint struggling noise,<br/>Which scarcely could be called a voice,<br/>  Together scared him off at length.<br/>I know no more--my latest dream<br/>  Is something of a lovely star<br/>  Which fixed my dull eyes from afar,<br/>And went and came with wandering beam,<br/>And of the cold--dull--swimming--dense<br/>Sensation of recurring sense,<br/>And then subsiding back to death,<br/>And then again a little breath,<br/>A little thrill--a short suspense,<br/>  An icy sickness curdling o'er<br/>My heart, and sparks that crossed my brain--<br/>A gasp--a throb--a start of pain,<br/>  A sigh--and nothing more.<br/><br/>"I woke--where was I?--Do I see<br/>A human face look down on me?<br/>And doth a roof above me close?<br/>Do these limbs on a couch repose?<br/>Is this a chamber where I lie?<br/>And is it mortal yon bright eye,<br/>That watches me with gentle glance?<br/>  I closed my own again once more,<br/>As doubtful that my former trance<br/>  Could not as yet be o'er.<br/>A slender girl, long-haired, and tall,<br/>Sate watching by the cottage wall.<br/>The sparkle of her eye I caught,<br/>Even with my first return of thought;<br/>For ever and anon she threw<br/>  A prying, pitying glance on me<br/>  With her black eyes so wild and free:<br/>I gazed, and gazed, until I knew<br/>  No vision it could be,--<br/>But that I lived, and was released<br/>From adding to the vulture's feast:<br/>And when the Cossack maid beheld<br/>My heavy eyes at length unsealed,<br/>She smiled--and I essayed to speak,<br/>  But failed--and she approached, and made<br/>  With lip and finger signs that said,<br/>I must not strive as yet to break<br/>The silence, till my strength should be<br/>Enough to leave my accents free;<br/>And then her hand on mine she laid,<br/>And smoothed the pillow for my head,<br/>And stole along on tiptoe tread,<br/>  And gently oped the door, and spake<br/>In whispers--ne'er was voice so sweet!<br/>Even music followed her light feet.<br/>  But those she called were not awake,<br/>And she went forth; but, ere she passed,<br/>Another look on me she cast,<br/>  Another sign she made, to say,<br/>That I had nought to fear, that all<br/>Were near, at my command or call,<br/>  And she would not delay<br/>Her due return:--while she was gone,<br/>Methought I felt too much alone.<br/><br/>"She came with mother and with sire--<br/>What need of more?--I will not tire<br/>With long recital of the rest,<br/>Since I became the Cossack's guest.<br/>They found me senseless on the plain,<br/>  They bore me to the nearest hut,<br/>They brought me into life again--<br/>Me--one day o'er their realm to reign!<br/>  Thus the vain fool who strove to glut<br/>His rage, refining on my pain,<br/>  Sent me forth to the wilderness,<br/>Bound--naked--bleeding--and alone,<br/>To pass the desert to a throne,--<br/>  What mortal his own doom may guess?<br/>  Let none despond, let none despair!<br/>To-morrow the Borysthenes<br/>May see our coursers graze at ease<br/>Upon his Turkish bank,--and never<br/>Had I such welcome for a river<br/>  As I shall yield when safely there.<br/>Comrades, good night!"--The Hetman threw<br/>  His length beneath the oak-tree shade,<br/>  With leafy couch already made--<br/>A bed nor comfortless nor new<br/>To him, who took his rest whene'er<br/>The hour arrived, no matter where:<br/>  His eyes the hastening slumbers steep.<br/>And if ye marvel Charles forgot<br/>To thank his tale, _he_ wondered not,--<br/>  The King had been an hour asleep!
