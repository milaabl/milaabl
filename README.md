# üíÆ Paris by *Alan Seeger*

<p>
    First, London, for its myriads; for its height,<br/>Manhattan heaped in towering stalagmite;<br/>But Paris for the smoothness of the paths<br/>That lead the heart unto the heart's delight. . . .<br/><br/><br/>Fair loiterer on the threshold of those days<br/>When there's no lovelier prize the world displays<br/>Than, having beauty and your twenty years,<br/>You have the means to conquer and the ways,<br/><br/><br/>And coming where the crossroads separate<br/>And down each vista glories and wonders wait,<br/>Crowning each path with pinnacles so fair<br/>You know not which to choose, and hesitate --<br/><br/><br/>Oh, go to Paris. . . . In the midday gloom<br/>Of some old quarter take a little room<br/>That looks off over Paris and its towers<br/>From Saint Gervais round to the Emperor's Tomb, --<br/><br/><br/>So high that you can hear a mating dove<br/>Croon down the chimney from the roof above,<br/>See Notre Dame and know how sweet it is<br/>To wake between Our Lady and our love.<br/><br/><br/>And have a little balcony to bring<br/>Fair plants to fill with verdure and blossoming,<br/>That sparrows seek, to feed from pretty hands,<br/>And swallows circle over in the Spring.<br/><br/><br/>There of an evening you shall sit at ease<br/>In the sweet month of flowering chestnut-trees,<br/>There with your little darling in your arms,<br/>Your pretty dark-eyed Manon or Louise.<br/><br/><br/>And looking out over the domes and towers<br/>That chime the fleeting quarters and the hours,<br/>While the bright clouds banked eastward back of them<br/>Blush in the sunset, pink as hawthorn flowers,<br/><br/><br/>You cannot fail to think, as I have done,<br/>Some of life's ends attained, so you be one<br/>Who measures life's attainment by the hours<br/>That Joy has rescued from oblivion.<br/><br/>II<br/><br/><br/>Come out into the evening streets. The green light lessens in the west.<br/>The city laughs and liveliest her fervid pulse of pleasure beats.<br/><br/><br/>The belfry on Saint Severin strikes eight across the smoking eaves:<br/>Come out under the lights and leaves<br/>to the Reine Blanche on Saint Germain. . . .<br/><br/><br/>Now crowded diners fill the floor of brasserie and restaurant.<br/>Shrill voices cry "L'Intransigeant," and corners echo "Paris-Sport."<br/><br/><br/>Where rows of tables from the street are screened with shoots of box and bay,<br/>The ragged minstrels sing and play and gather sous from those that eat.<br/><br/><br/>And old men stand with menu-cards, inviting passers-by to dine<br/>On the bright terraces that line the Latin Quarter boulevards. . . .<br/><br/><br/>But, having drunk and eaten well, 'tis pleasant then to stroll along<br/>And mingle with the merry throng that promenades on Saint Michel.<br/><br/><br/>Here saunter types of every sort. The shoddy jostle with the chic:<br/>Turk and Roumanian and Greek; student and officer and sport;<br/><br/><br/>Slavs with their peasant, Christ-like heads,<br/>and courtezans like powdered moths,<br/>And peddlers from Algiers, with cloths<br/>bright-hued and stitched with golden threads;<br/><br/><br/>And painters with big, serious eyes go rapt in dreams, fantastic shapes<br/>In corduroys and Spanish capes and locks uncut and flowing ties;<br/><br/><br/>And lovers wander two by two, oblivious among the press,<br/>And making one of them no less, all lovers shall be dear to you:<br/><br/><br/>All laughing lips you move among, all happy hearts that, knowing what<br/>Makes life worth while, have wasted not the sweet reprieve of being young.<br/><br/><br/>"Comment ca va!" "Mon vieux!" "Mon cher!"<br/>Friends greet and banter as they pass.<br/>'Tis sweet to see among the mass comrades and lovers everywhere,<br/><br/><br/>A law that's sane, a Love that's free, and men of every birth and blood<br/>Allied in one great brotherhood of Art and Joy and Poverty. . . .<br/><br/><br/>The open cafe-windows frame loungers at their liqueurs and beer,<br/>And walking past them one can hear fragments of Tosca and Boheme.<br/><br/><br/>And in the brilliant-lighted door of cinemas the barker calls,<br/>And lurid posters paint the walls with scenes of Love and crime and war.<br/><br/><br/>But follow past the flaming lights, borne onward with the stream of feet,<br/>Where Bullier's further up the street is marvellous on Thursday nights.<br/><br/><br/>Here all Bohemia flocks apace; you could not often find elsewhere<br/>So many happy heads and fair assembled in one time and place.<br/><br/><br/>Under the glare and noise and heat the galaxy of dancing whirls,<br/>Smokers, with covered heads, and girls dressed in the costume of the street.<br/><br/><br/>From tables packed around the wall the crowds that drink and frolic there<br/>Spin serpentines into the air far out over the reeking hall,<br/><br/><br/>That, settling where the coils unroll, tangle with pink and green and blue<br/>The crowds that rag to "Hitchy-koo" and boston to the "Barcarole". . . .<br/><br/><br/>Here Mimi ventures, at fifteen, to make her debut in romance,<br/>And join her sisters in the dance and see the life that they have seen.<br/><br/><br/>Her hair, a tight hat just allows to brush beneath the narrow brim,<br/>Docked, in the model's present whim, `frise' and banged above the brows.<br/><br/><br/>Uncorseted, her clinging dress with every step and turn betrays,<br/>In pretty and provoking ways her adolescent loveliness,<br/><br/><br/>As guiding Gaby or Lucile she dances, emulating them<br/>In each disturbing stratagem and each lascivious appeal.<br/><br/><br/>Each turn a challenge, every pose an invitation to compete,<br/>Along the maze of whirling feet the grave-eyed little wanton goes,<br/><br/><br/>And, flaunting all the hue that lies in childish cheeks and nubile waist,<br/>She passes, charmingly unchaste, illumining ignoble eyes. . . .<br/><br/><br/>But now the blood from every heart leaps madder through abounding veins<br/>As first the fascinating strains of "El Irresistible" start.<br/><br/><br/>Caught in the spell of pulsing sound, impatient elbows lift and yield<br/>The scented softnesses they shield to arms that catch and close them round,<br/><br/><br/>Surrender, swift to be possessed, the silken supple forms beneath<br/>To all the bliss the measures breathe and all the madness they suggest.<br/><br/><br/>Crowds congregate and make a ring. Four deep they stand and strain to see<br/>The tango in its ecstasy of glowing lives that clasp and cling.<br/><br/><br/>Lithe limbs relaxed, exalted eyes fastened on vacancy, they seem<br/>To float upon the perfumed stream of some voluptuous Paradise,<br/><br/><br/>Or, rapt in some Arabian Night, to rock there, cradled and subdued,<br/>In a luxurious lassitude of rhythm and sensual delight.<br/><br/><br/>And only when the measures cease and terminate the flowing dance<br/>They waken from their magic trance and join the cries that clamor "Bis!" . . .<br/><br/><br/>Midnight adjourns the festival. The couples climb the crowded stair,<br/>And out into the warm night air go singing fragments of the ball.<br/><br/><br/>Close-folded in desire they pass, or stop to drink and talk awhile<br/>In the cafes along the mile from Bullier's back to Montparnasse:<br/><br/><br/>The "Closerie" or "La Rotonde", where smoking, under lamplit trees,<br/>Sit Art's enamored devotees, chatting across their `brune' and `blonde'. . . .<br/><br/><br/>Make one of them and come to know sweet Paris -- not as many do,<br/>Seeing but the folly of the few, the froth, the tinsel, and the show --<br/><br/><br/>But taking some white proffered hand that from Earth's barren every day<br/>Can lead you by the shortest way into Love's florid fairyland.<br/><br/><br/>And that divine enchanted life that lurks under Life's common guise --<br/>That city of romance that lies within the City's toil and strife --<br/><br/><br/>Shall, knocking, open to your hands, for Love is all its golden key,<br/>And one's name murmured tenderly the only magic it demands.<br/><br/><br/>And when all else is gray and void in the vast gulf of memory,<br/>Green islands of delight shall be all blessed moments so enjoyed:<br/><br/><br/>When vaulted with the city skies, on its cathedral floors you stood,<br/>And, priest of a bright brotherhood, performed the mystic sacrifice,<br/><br/><br/>At Love's high altar fit to stand, with fire and incense aureoled,<br/>The celebrant in cloth of gold with Spring and Youth on either hand.<br/><br/>III<br/><br/><br/>Choral Song<br/><br/><br/>Have ye gazed on its grandeur<br/>Or stood where it stands<br/>With opal and amber<br/>Adorning the lands,<br/>And orcharded domes<br/>Of the hue of all flowers?<br/>Sweet melody roams<br/>Through its blossoming bowers,<br/>Sweet bells usher in from its belfries the train of the honey-sweet hour.<br/><br/><br/>A city resplendent,<br/>Fulfilled of good things,<br/>On its ramparts are pendent<br/>The bucklers of kings.<br/>Broad banners unfurled<br/>Are afloat in its air.<br/>The lords of the world<br/>Look for harborage there.<br/>None finds save he comes as a bridegroom, having roses and vine in his hair.<br/><br/><br/>'Tis the city of Lovers,<br/>There many paths meet.<br/>Blessed he above others,<br/>With faltering feet,<br/>Who past its proud spires<br/>Intends not nor hears<br/>The noise of its lyres<br/>Grow faint in his ears!<br/>Men reach it through portals of triumph, but leave through a postern of tears.<br/><br/><br/>It was thither, ambitious,<br/>We came for Youth's right,<br/>When our lips yearned for kisses<br/>As moths for the light,<br/>When our souls cried for Love<br/>As for life-giving rain<br/>Wan leaves of the grove,<br/>Withered grass of the plain,<br/>And our flesh ached for Love-flesh beside it with bitter, intolerable pain.<br/><br/><br/>Under arbor and trellis,<br/>Full of flutes, full of flowers,<br/>What mad fortunes befell us,<br/>What glad orgies were ours!<br/>In the days of our youth,<br/>In our festal attire,<br/>When the sweet flesh was smooth,<br/>When the swift blood was fire,<br/>And all Earth paid in orange and purple to pavilion the bed of Desire!
