# üíÆ The Funeral of Youth: Threnody by *Rupert Brooke*

<p>
    The Day that Youth had died,<br/>There came to his grave-side,<br/>In decent mourning, from the country‚Äôs ends,<br/>Those scatter‚Äôd friends<br/>Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,<br/>And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,<br/>In feast and wine and many-crown‚Äôd carouse,<br/>The days and nights and dawnings of the time<br/>When Youth kept open house,<br/>Nor left untasted<br/>Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,<br/>No quest of his unshar‚Äôd‚Äî<br/>All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar‚Äôd,<br/>Followed their old friend‚Äôs bier.<br/>Folly went first,<br/>With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers‚Äôd;<br/>And after trod the bearers, hat in hand‚Äî<br/>Laughter, most hoarse, and Captain Pride with tanned<br/>And martial face all grim, and fussy Joy<br/>Who had to catch a train, and Lust, poor, snivelling boy;<br/>These bore the dear departed.<br/>Behind them, broken-hearted,<br/>Came Grief, so noisy a widow, that all said,<br/>‚ÄúHad he but wed<br/>Her elder sister Sorrow, in her stead!‚Äù<br/>And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,<br/>The fatherless children, Colour, Tune, and Rhyme<br/>(The sweet lad Rhyme), ran all-uncomprehending.<br/>Then, at the way‚Äôs sad ending,<br/>Round the raw grave they stay‚Äôd. Old Wisdom read,<br/>In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.<br/>There stood Romance,<br/>The furrowing tears had mark‚Äôd her roug–∏d cheek;<br/>Poor old Conceit, his wonder unassuaged;<br/>Dead Innocency‚Äôs daughter, Ignorance;<br/>And shabby, ill-dress‚Äôd Generosity;<br/>And Argument, too full of woe to speak;<br/>Passion, grown portly, something middle-aged;<br/>And Friendship‚Äînot a minute older, she;<br/>Impatience, ever taking out his watch;<br/>Faith, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch<br/>Old Wisdom‚Äôs endless drone.<br/>Beauty was there,<br/>Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.<br/>Poor maz‚Äôd Imagination; Fancy wild;<br/>Ardour, the sunlight on his greying hair;<br/>Contentment, who had known Youth as a child<br/>And never seen him since. And Spring came too,<br/>Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers‚Äî<br/>She did not stay for long.<br/>And Truth, and Grace, and all the merry crew,<br/>The laughing Winds and Rivers, and lithe Hours;<br/>And Hope, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing Song;‚Äî<br/>Yes, with much woe and mourning general,<br/>At dead Youth‚Äôs funeral,<br/>Even these were met once more together, all,<br/>Who erst the fair and living Youth did know;<br/>All, except only Love. Love had died long ago.
