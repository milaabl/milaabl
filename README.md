  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Song by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Cold, cold is the blast when December is howling,<br/>Cold are the damps on a dying man's brow,--<br/>Stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling,<br/>And sad is the grave where a loved one lies low;<br/>But colder is scorn from the being who loved thee,<br/>More stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee,<br/>More sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee,<br/>Which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow--<br/><br/>And ah! poor -- has felt all this horror,<br/>Full long the fallen victim contended with fate:<br/>'Till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow,<br/>She sought her babe's food at her ruiner's gate--<br/>Another had charmed the remorseless betrayer,<br/>He turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer,<br/>She said nothing, but wringing the wet from her hair,<br/>Crossed the dark mountain side, though the hour it was late.<br/>'Twas on the wild height of the dark Penmanmawr,<br/>That the form of the wasted -- reclined;<br/>She shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar,<br/>And she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind.--<br/>I call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle,<br/>I call not yon clouds where the elements battle,<br/>But thee, cruel -- I call thee unkind!'--<br/><br/>Then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain,<br/>And deliriously laughing, a garland entwined,<br/>She bedewed it with tears, then she hung o'er the fountain,<br/>And leaving it, cast it a prey to the wind.<br/>'Ah! go,' she exclaimed, 'when the tempest is yelling,<br/>'Tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling,<br/>But I left, a pitiless outcast, my dwelling,<br/>My garments are torn, so they say is my mind--'<br/><br/>Not long lived --, but over her grave<br/>Waved the desolate form of a storm-blasted yew,<br/>Around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave,<br/>But spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew.<br/>Then stay thy swift steps mid the dark mountain heather,<br/>Though chill blow the wind and severe is the weather,<br/>For perfidy, traveller! cannot bereave her,<br/>Of the tears, to the tombs of the innocent due.--
