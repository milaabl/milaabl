# üíÆ The Daemon of the World by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    A FRAGMENT.<br/><br/>PART 1.<br/><br/>Nec tantum prodere vati,<br/>Quantum scire licet. Venit aetas omnis in unam<br/>Congeriem, miserumque premunt tot saecula pectus.<br/>LUCAN, Phars. v. 176.<br/><br/>How wonderful is Death,<br/>Death and his brother Sleep!<br/>One pale as yonder wan and horned moon,<br/>With lips of lurid blue,<br/>The other glowing like the vital morn,<br/>When throned on ocean's wave<br/>It breathes over the world:<br/>Yet both so passing strange and wonderful!<br/><br/>Hath then the iron-sceptred Skeleton,<br/>Whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres,<br/>To the hell dogs that couch beneath his throne<br/>Cast that fair prey? Must that divinest form,<br/>Which love and admiration cannot view<br/>Without a beating heart, whose azure veins<br/>Steal like dark streams along a field of snow,<br/>Whose outline is as fair as marble clothed<br/>In light of some sublimest mind, decay?<br/>Nor putrefaction's breath<br/>Leave aught of this pure spectacle<br/>But loathsomeness and ruin?--<br/>Spare aught but a dark theme,<br/>On which the lightest heart might moralize?<br/>Or is it but that downy-winged slumbers<br/>Have charmed their nurse coy Silence near her lids<br/>To watch their own repose?<br/>Will they, when morning's beam<br/>Flows through those wells of light,<br/>Seek far from noise and day some western cave,<br/>Where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds<br/>A lulling murmur weave?--<br/>Ianthe doth not sleep<br/>The dreamless sleep of death:<br/>Nor in her moonlight chamber silently<br/>Doth Henry hear her regular pulses throb,<br/>Or mark her delicate cheek<br/>With interchange of hues mock the broad moon,<br/>Outwatching weary night,<br/>Without assured reward.<br/>Her dewy eyes are closed;<br/>On their translucent lids, whose texture fine<br/>Scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below<br/>With unapparent fire,<br/>The baby Sleep is pillowed:<br/>Her golden tresses shade<br/>The bosom's stainless pride,<br/>Twining like tendrils of the parasite<br/>Around a marble column.<br/><br/>Hark! whence that rushing sound?<br/>'Tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps<br/>Around a lonely ruin<br/>When west winds sigh and evening waves respond<br/>In whispers from the shore:<br/>'Tis wilder than the unmeasured notes<br/>Which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves<br/>The genii of the breezes sweep.<br/>Floating on waves of music and of light,<br/>The chariot of the Daemon of the World<br/>Descends in silent power:<br/>Its shape reposed within: slight as some cloud<br/>That catches but the palest tinge of day<br/>When evening yields to night,<br/>Bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue<br/>Its transitory robe.<br/>Four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful<br/>Draw that strange car of glory, reins of light<br/>Check their unearthly speed; they stop and fold<br/>Their wings of braided air:<br/>The Daemon leaning from the ethereal car<br/>Gazed on the slumbering maid.<br/>Human eye hath ne'er beheld<br/>A shape so wild, so bright, so beautiful,<br/>As that which o'er the maiden's charmed sleep<br/>Waving a starry wand,<br/>Hung like a mist of light.<br/>Such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds<br/>Of wakening spring arose,<br/>Filling the chamber and the moonlight sky.<br/>Maiden, the world's supremest spirit<br/>Beneath the shadow of her wings<br/>Folds all thy memory doth inherit<br/>From ruin of divinest things,<br/>Feelings that lure thee to betray,<br/>And light of thoughts that pass away.<br/>For thou hast earned a mighty boon,<br/>The truths which wisest poets see<br/>Dimly, thy mind may make its own,<br/>Rewarding its own majesty,<br/>Entranced in some diviner mood<br/>Of self-oblivious solitude.<br/><br/>Custom, and Faith, and Power thou spurnest;<br/>From hate and awe thy heart is free;<br/>Ardent and pure as day thou burnest,<br/>For dark and cold mortality<br/>A living light, to cheer it long,<br/>The watch-fires of the world among.<br/><br/>Therefore from nature's inner shrine,<br/>Where gods and fiends in worship bend,<br/>Majestic spirit, be it thine<br/>The flame to seize, the veil to rend,<br/>Where the vast snake Eternity<br/>In charmed sleep doth ever lie.<br/><br/>All that inspires thy voice of love,<br/>Or speaks in thy unclosing eyes,<br/>Or through thy frame doth burn or move,<br/>Or think or feel, awake, arise!<br/>Spirit, leave for mine and me<br/>Earth's unsubstantial mimicry!<br/><br/>It ceased, and from the mute and moveless frame<br/>A radiant spirit arose,<br/>All beautiful in naked purity.<br/>Robed in its human hues it did ascend,<br/>Disparting as it went the silver clouds,<br/>It moved towards the car, and took its seat<br/>Beside the Daemon shape.<br/><br/>Obedient to the sweep of aery song,<br/>The mighty ministers<br/>Unfurled their prismy wings.<br/>The magic car moved on;<br/>The night was fair, innumerable stars<br/>Studded heaven's dark blue vault;<br/>The eastern wave grew pale<br/>With the first smile of morn.<br/>The magic car moved on.<br/>From the swift sweep of wings<br/>The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew;<br/>And where the burning wheels<br/>Eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak<br/>Was traced a line of lightning.<br/>Now far above a rock the utmost verge<br/>Of the wide earth it flew,<br/>The rival of the Andes, whose dark brow<br/>Frowned o'er the silver sea.<br/>Far, far below the chariot's stormy path,<br/>Calm as a slumbering babe,<br/>Tremendous ocean lay.<br/>Its broad and silent mirror gave to view<br/>The pale and waning stars,<br/>The chariot's fiery track,<br/>And the grey light of morn<br/>Tingeing those fleecy clouds<br/>That cradled in their folds the infant dawn.<br/>The chariot seemed to fly<br/>Through the abyss of an immense concave,<br/>Radiant with million constellations, tinged<br/>With shades of infinite colour,<br/>And semicircled with a belt<br/>Flashing incessant meteors.<br/><br/>As they approached their goal,<br/>The winged shadows seemed to gather speed.<br/>The sea no longer was distinguished; earth<br/>Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere, suspended<br/>In the black concave of heaven<br/>With the sun's cloudless orb,<br/>Whose rays of rapid light<br/>Parted around the chariot's swifter course,<br/>And fell like ocean's feathery spray<br/>Dashed from the boiling surge<br/>Before a vessel's prow.<br/><br/>The magic car moved on.<br/>Earth's distant orb appeared<br/>The smallest light that twinkles in the heavens,<br/>Whilst round the chariot's way<br/>Innumerable systems widely rolled,<br/>And countless spheres diffused<br/>An ever varying glory.<br/>It was a sight of wonder! Some were horned,<br/>And like the moon's argentine crescent hung<br/>In the dark dome of heaven; some did shed<br/>A clear mild beam like Hesperus, while the sea<br/>Yet glows with fading sunlight; others dashed<br/>Athwart the night with trains of bickering fire,<br/>Like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven;<br/>Some shone like stars, and as the chariot passed<br/>Bedimmed all other light.<br/><br/>Spirit of Nature! here<br/>In this interminable wilderness<br/>Of worlds, at whose involved immensity<br/>Even soaring fancy staggers,<br/>Here is thy fitting temple.<br/>Yet not the lightest leaf<br/>That quivers to the passing breeze<br/>Is less instinct with thee,--<br/>Yet not the meanest worm.<br/>That lurks in graves and fattens on the dead,<br/>Less shares thy eternal breath.<br/>Spirit of Nature! thou<br/>Imperishable as this glorious scene,<br/>Here is thy fitting temple.<br/><br/>If solitude hath ever led thy steps<br/>To the shore of the immeasurable sea,<br/>And thou hast lingered there<br/>Until the sun's broad orb<br/>Seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean,<br/>Thou must have marked the braided webs of gold<br/>That without motion hang<br/>Over the sinking sphere:<br/>Thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds,<br/>Edged with intolerable radiancy,<br/>Towering like rocks of jet<br/>Above the burning deep:<br/>And yet there is a moment<br/>When the sun's highest point<br/>Peers like a star o'er ocean's western edge,<br/>When those far clouds of feathery purple gleam<br/>Like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea:<br/>Then has thy rapt imagination soared<br/>Where in the midst of all existing things<br/>The temple of the mightiest Daemon stands.<br/><br/>Yet not the golden islands<br/>That gleam amid yon flood of purple light,<br/>Nor the feathery curtains<br/>That canopy the sun's resplendent couch,<br/>Nor the burnished ocean waves<br/>Paving that gorgeous dome,<br/>So fair, so wonderful a sight<br/>As the eternal temple could afford.<br/>The elements of all that human thought<br/>Can frame of lovely or sublime, did join<br/>To rear the fabric of the fane, nor aught<br/>Of earth may image forth its majesty.<br/>Yet likest evening's vault that faery hall,<br/>As heaven low resting on the wave it spread<br/>Its floors of flashing light,<br/>Its vast and azure dome;<br/>And on the verge of that obscure abyss<br/>Where crystal battlements o'erhang the gulf<br/>Of the dark world, ten thousand spheres diffuse<br/>Their lustre through its adamantine gates.<br/><br/>The magic car no longer moved;<br/>The Daemon and the Spirit<br/>Entered the eternal gates.<br/>Those clouds of aery gold<br/>That slept in glittering billows<br/>Beneath the azure canopy,<br/>With the ethereal footsteps trembled not;<br/>While slight and odorous mists<br/>Floated to strains of thrilling melody<br/>Through the vast columns and the pearly shrines.<br/><br/>The Daemon and the Spirit<br/>Approached the overhanging battlement,<br/>Below lay stretched the boundless universe!<br/>There, far as the remotest line<br/>That limits swift imagination's flight.<br/>Unending orbs mingled in mazy motion,<br/>Immutably fulfilling<br/>Eternal Nature's law.<br/>Above, below, around,<br/>The circling systems formed<br/>A wilderness of harmony.<br/>Each with undeviating aim<br/>In eloquent silence through the depths of space<br/>Pursued its wondrous way.--<br/><br/>Awhile the Spirit paused in ecstasy.<br/>Yet soon she saw, as the vast spheres swept by,<br/>Strange things within their belted orbs appear.<br/>Like animated frenzies, dimly moved<br/>Shadows, and skeletons, and fiendly shapes,<br/>Thronging round human graves, and o'er the dead<br/>Sculpturing records for each memory<br/>In verse, such as malignant gods pronounce,<br/>Blasting the hopes of men, when heaven and hell<br/>Confounded burst in ruin o'er the world:<br/>And they did build vast trophies, instruments<br/>Of murder, human bones, barbaric gold,<br/>Skins torn from living men, and towers of skulls<br/>With sightless holes gazing on blinder heaven,<br/>Mitres, and crowns, and brazen chariots stained<br/>With blood, and scrolls of mystic wickedness,<br/>The sanguine codes of venerable crime.<br/>The likeness of a throned king came by.<br/>When these had passed, bearing upon his brow<br/>A threefold crown; his countenance was calm.<br/>His eye severe and cold; but his right hand<br/>Was charged with bloody coin, and he did gnaw<br/>By fits, with secret smiles, a human heart<br/>Concealed beneath his robe; and motley shapes,<br/>A multitudinous throng, around him knelt.<br/>With bosoms bare, and bowed heads, and false looks<br/>Of true submission, as the sphere rolled by.<br/>Brooking no eye to witness their foul shame,<br/>Which human hearts must feel, while human tongues<br/>Tremble to speak, they did rage horribly,<br/>Breathing in self-contempt fierce blasphemies<br/>Against the Daemon of the World, and high<br/>Hurling their armed hands where the pure Spirit,<br/>Serene and inaccessibly secure,<br/>Stood on an isolated pinnacle.<br/>The flood of ages combating below,<br/>The depth of the unbounded universe<br/>Above, and all around<br/>Necessity's unchanging harmony.<br/><br/>PART 2.<br/><br/>O happy Earth! reality of Heaven!<br/>To which those restless powers that ceaselessly<br/>Throng through the human universe aspire;<br/>Thou consummation of all mortal hope!<br/>Thou glorious prize of blindly-working will!<br/>Whose rays, diffused throughout all space and time,<br/>Verge to one point and blend for ever there:<br/>Of purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place!<br/>Where care and sorrow, impotence and crime,<br/>Languor, disease, and ignorance dare not come:<br/>O happy Earth, reality of Heaven!<br/><br/>Genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams,<br/>And dim forebodings of thy loveliness,<br/>Haunting the human heart, have there entwined<br/>Those rooted hopes, that the proud Power of Evil<br/>Shall not for ever on this fairest world<br/>Shake pestilence and war, or that his slaves<br/>With blasphemy for prayer, and human blood<br/>For sacrifice, before his shrine for ever<br/>In adoration bend, or Erebus<br/>With all its banded fiends shall not uprise<br/>To overwhelm in envy and revenge<br/>The dauntless and the good, who dare to hurl<br/>Defiance at his throne, girt tho' it be<br/>With Death's omnipotence. Thou hast beheld<br/>His empire, o'er the present and the past;<br/>It was a desolate sight--now gaze on mine,<br/>Futurity. Thou hoary giant Time,<br/>Render thou up thy half-devoured babes,--<br/>And from the cradles of eternity,<br/>Where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep<br/>By the deep murmuring stream of passing things,<br/>Tear thou that gloomy shroud.--Spirit, behold<br/>Thy glorious destiny!<br/><br/>The Spirit saw<br/>The vast frame of the renovated world<br/>Smile in the lap of Chaos, and the sense<br/>Of hope thro' her fine texture did suffuse<br/>Such varying glow, as summer evening casts<br/>On undulating clouds and deepening lakes.<br/>Like the vague sighings of a wind at even,<br/>That wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea<br/>And dies on the creation of its breath,<br/>And sinks and rises, fails and swells by fits,<br/>Was the sweet stream of thought that with wild motion<br/>Flowed o'er the Spirit's human sympathies.<br/>The mighty tide of thought had paused awhile,<br/>Which from the Daemon now like Ocean's stream<br/>Again began to pour.--<br/><br/>To me is given<br/>The wonders of the human world to keep-<br/>Space, matter, time and mind--let the sight<br/>Renew and strengthen all thy failing hope.<br/>All things are recreated, and the flame<br/>Of consentaneous love inspires all life:<br/>The fertile bosom of the earth gives suck<br/>To myriads, who still grow beneath her care,<br/>Rewarding her with their pure perfectness:<br/>The balmy breathings of the wind inhale<br/>Her virtues, and diffuse them all abroad:<br/>Health floats amid the gentle atmosphere,<br/>Glows in the fruits, and mantles on the stream;<br/>No storms deform the beaming brow of heaven,<br/>Nor scatter in the freshness of its pride<br/>The foliage of the undecaying trees;<br/>But fruits are ever ripe, flowers ever fair,<br/>And Autumn proudly bears her matron grace,<br/>Kindling a flush on the fair cheek of Spring,<br/>Whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit<br/>Reflects its tint and blushes into love.<br/><br/>The habitable earth is full of bliss;<br/>Those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled<br/>By everlasting snow-storms round the poles,<br/>Where matter dared not vegetate nor live,<br/>But ceaseless frost round the vast solitude<br/>Bound its broad zone of stillness, are unloosed;<br/>And fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles<br/>Ruffle the placid ocean-deep, that rolls<br/>Its broad, bright surges to the sloping sand,<br/>Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet<br/>To murmur through the heaven-breathing groves<br/>And melodise with man's blest nature there.<br/><br/>The vast tract of the parched and sandy waste<br/>Now teems with countless rills and shady woods,<br/>Corn-fields and pastures and white cottages;<br/>And where the startled wilderness did hear<br/>A savage conqueror stained in kindred blood,<br/>Hymmng his victory, or the milder snake<br/>Crushing the bones of some frail antelope<br/>Within his brazen folds--the dewy lawn,<br/>Offering sweet incense to the sunrise, smiles<br/>To see a babe before his mother's door,<br/>Share with the green and golden basilisk<br/>That comes to lick his feet, his morning's meal.<br/><br/>Those trackless deeps, where many a weary sail<br/>Has seen, above the illimitable plain,<br/>Morning on night and night on morning rise,<br/>Whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread<br/>Its shadowy mountains on the sunbright sea,<br/>Where the loud roarings of the tempest-waves<br/>So long have mingled with the gusty wind<br/>In melancholy loneliness, and swept<br/>The desert of those ocean solitudes,<br/>But vocal to the sea-bird's harrowing shriek,<br/>The bellowing monster, and the rushing storm,<br/>Now to the sweet and many-mingling sounds<br/>Of kindliest human impulses respond:<br/>Those lonely realms bright garden-isles begem,<br/>With lightsome clouds and shining seas between,<br/>And fertile valleys resonant with bliss,<br/>Whilst green woods overcanopy the wave,<br/>Which like a toil-worn labourer leaps to shore,<br/>To meet the kisses of the flowerets there.<br/><br/>Man chief perceives the change, his being notes<br/>The gradual renovation, and defines<br/>Each movement of its progress on his mind.<br/>Man, where the gloom of the long polar night<br/>Lowered o'er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil,<br/>Where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost<br/>Basked in the moonlight's ineffectual glow,<br/>Shrank with the plants, and darkened with the night;<br/>Nor where the tropics bound the realms of day<br/>With a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame,<br/>Where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere<br/>Scattered the seeds of pestilence, and fed<br/>Unnatural vegetation, where the land<br/>Teemed with all earthquake, tempest and disease,<br/>Was man a nobler being; slavery<br/>Had crushed him to his country's blood-stained dust.<br/><br/>Even where the milder zone afforded man<br/>A seeming shelter, yet contagion there,<br/>Blighting his being with unnumbered ills,<br/>Spread like a quenchless fire; nor truth availed<br/>Till late to arrest its progress, or create<br/>That peace which first in bloodless victory waved<br/>Her snowy standard o'er this favoured clime:<br/>There man was long the train-bearer of slaves,<br/>The mimic of surrounding misery,<br/>The jackal of ambition's lion-rage,<br/>The bloodhound of religion's hungry zeal.<br/><br/>Here now the human being stands adorning<br/>This loveliest earth with taintless body and mind;<br/>Blest from his birth with all bland impulses,<br/>Which gently in his noble bosom wake<br/>All kindly passions and all pure desires.<br/>Him, still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing,<br/>Which from the exhaustless lore of human weal<br/>Dawns on the virtuous mind, the thoughts that rise<br/>In time-destroying infiniteness gift<br/>With self-enshrined eternity, that mocks<br/>The unprevailing hoariness of age,<br/>And man, once fleeting o'er the transient scene<br/>Swift as an unremembered vision, stands<br/>Immortal upon earth: no longer now<br/>He slays the beast that sports around his dwelling<br/>And horribly devours its mangled flesh,<br/>Or drinks its vital blood, which like a stream<br/>Of poison thro' his fevered veins did flow<br/>Feeding a plague that secretly consumed<br/>His feeble frame, and kindling in his mind<br/>Hatred, despair, and fear and vain belief,<br/>The germs of misery, death, disease and crime.<br/>No longer now the winged habitants,<br/>That in the woods their sweet lives sing away,<br/>Flee from the form of man; but gather round,<br/>And prune their sunny feathers on the hands<br/>Which little children stretch in friendly sport<br/>Towards these dreadless partners of their play.<br/>All things are void of terror: man has lost<br/>His desolating privilege, and stands<br/>An equal amidst equals: happiness<br/>And science dawn though late upon the earth;<br/>Peace cheers the mind, health renovates the frame;<br/>Disease and pleasure cease to mingle here,<br/>Reason and passion cease to combat there;<br/>Whilst mind unfettered o'er the earth extends<br/>Its all-subduing energies, and wields<br/>The sceptre of a vast dominion there.<br/><br/>Mild is the slow necessity of death:<br/>The tranquil spirit fails beneath its grasp,<br/>Without a groan, almost without a fear,<br/>Resigned in peace to the necessity,<br/>Calm as a voyager to some distant land,<br/>And full of wonder, full of hope as he.<br/>The deadly germs of languor and disease<br/>Waste in the human frame, and Nature gifts<br/>With choicest boons her human worshippers.<br/>How vigorous now the athletic form of age!<br/>How clear its open and unwrinkled brow!<br/>Where neither avarice, cunning, pride, or care,<br/>Had stamped the seal of grey deformity<br/>On all the mingling lineaments of time.<br/>How lovely the intrepid front of youth!<br/>How sweet the smiles of taintless infancy.<br/><br/>Within the massy prison's mouldering courts,<br/>Fearless and free the ruddy children play,<br/>Weaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows<br/>With the green ivy and the red wall-flower,<br/>That mock the dungeon's unavailing gloom;<br/>The ponderous chains, and gratings of strong iron,<br/>There rust amid the accumulated ruins<br/>Now mingling slowly with their native earth:<br/>There the broad beam of day, which feebly once<br/>Lighted the cheek of lean captivity<br/>With a pale and sickly glare, now freely shines<br/>On the pure smiles of infant playfulness:<br/>No more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair<br/>Peals through the echoing vaults, but soothing notes<br/>Of ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds<br/>And merriment are resonant around.<br/><br/>The fanes of Fear and Falsehood hear no more<br/>The voice that once waked multitudes to war<br/>Thundering thro' all their aisles: but now respond<br/>To the death dirge of the melancholy wind:<br/>It were a sight of awfulness to see<br/>The works of faith and slavery, so vast,<br/>So sumptuous, yet withal so perishing!<br/>Even as the corpse that rests beneath their wall.<br/>A thousand mourners deck the pomp of death<br/>To-day, the breathing marble glows above<br/>To decorate its memory, and tongues<br/>Are busy of its life: to-morrow, worms<br/>In silence and in darkness seize their prey.<br/>These ruins soon leave not a wreck behind:<br/>Their elements, wide-scattered o'er the globe,<br/>To happier shapes are moulded, and become<br/>Ministrant to all blissful impulses:<br/>Thus human things are perfected, and earth,<br/>Even as a child beneath its mother's love,<br/>Is strengthened in all excellence, and grows<br/>Fairer and nobler with each passing year.<br/><br/>Now Time his dusky pennons o'er the scene<br/>Closes in steadfast darkness, and the past<br/>Fades from our charmed sight. My task is done:<br/>Thy lore is learned. Earth's wonders are thine own,<br/>With all the fear and all the hope they bring.<br/>My spells are past: the present now recurs.<br/>Ah me! a pathless wilderness remains<br/>Yet unsubdued by man's reclaiming hand.<br/><br/>Yet, human Spirit, bravely hold thy course,<br/>Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue<br/>The gradual paths of an aspiring change:<br/>For birth and life and death, and that strange state<br/>Before the naked powers that thro' the world<br/>Wander like winds have found a human home,<br/>All tend to perfect happiness, and urge<br/>The restless wheels of being on their way,<br/>Whose flashing spokes, instinct with infinite life,<br/>Bicker and burn to gain their destined goal:<br/>For birth but wakes the universal mind<br/>Whose mighty streams might else in silence flow<br/>Thro' the vast world, to individual sense<br/>Of outward shows, whose unexperienced shape<br/>New modes of passion to its frame may lend;<br/>Life is its state of action, and the store<br/>Of all events is aggregated there<br/>That variegate the eternal universe;<br/>Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom,<br/>That leads to azure isles and beaming skies<br/>And happy regions of eternal hope.<br/>Therefore, O Spirit! fearlessly bear on:<br/>Though storms may break the primrose on its stalk,<br/>Though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom,<br/>Yet spring's awakening breath will woo the earth,<br/>To feed with kindliest dews its favourite flower,<br/>That blooms in mossy banks and darksome glens,<br/>Lighting the green wood with its sunny smile.<br/><br/>Fear not then, Spirit, death's disrobing hand,<br/>So welcome when the tyrant is awake,<br/>So welcome when the bigot's hell-torch flares;<br/>'Tis but the voyage of a darksome hour,<br/>The transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep.<br/>For what thou art shall perish utterly,<br/>But what is thine may never cease to be;<br/>Death is no foe to virtue: earth has seen<br/>Love's brightest roses on the scaffold bloom,<br/>Mingling with freedom's fadeless laurels there,<br/>And presaging the truth of visioned bliss.<br/>Are there not hopes within thee, which this scene<br/>Of linked and gradual being has confirmed?<br/>Hopes that not vainly thou, and living fires<br/>Of mind as radiant and as pure as thou,<br/>Have shone upon the paths of men--return,<br/>Surpassing Spirit, to that world, where thou<br/>Art destined an eternal war to wage<br/>With tyranny and falsehood, and uproot<br/>The germs of misery from the human heart.<br/>Thine is the hand whose piety would soothe<br/>The thorny pillow of unhappy crime,<br/>Whose impotence an easy pardon gains,<br/>Watching its wanderings as a friend's disease:<br/>Thine is the brow whose mildness would defy<br/>Its fiercest rage, and brave its sternest will,<br/>When fenced by power and master of the world.<br/>Thou art sincere and good; of resolute mind,<br/>Free from heart-withering custom's cold control,<br/>Of passion lofty, pure and unsubdued.<br/>Earth's pride and meanness could not vanquish thee,<br/>And therefore art thou worthy of the boon<br/>Which thou hast now received: virtue shall keep<br/>Thy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod,<br/>And many days of beaming hope shall bless<br/>Thy spotless life of sweet and sacred love.<br/>Go, happy one, and give that bosom joy<br/>Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch<br/>Light, life and rapture from thy smile.<br/><br/>The Daemon called its winged ministers.<br/>Speechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car,<br/>That rolled beside the crystal battlement,<br/>Bending her beamy eyes in thankfulness.<br/>The burning wheels inflame<br/>The steep descent of Heaven's untrodden way.<br/>Fast and far the chariot flew:<br/>The mighty globes that rolled<br/>Around the gate of the Eternal Fane<br/>Lessened by slow degrees, and soon appeared<br/>Such tiny twinklers as the planet orbs<br/>That ministering on the solar power<br/>With borrowed light pursued their narrower way.<br/>Earth floated then below:<br/>The chariot paused a moment;<br/>The Spirit then descended:<br/>And from the earth departing<br/>The shadows with swift wings<br/>Speeded like thought upon the light of Heaven.<br/><br/>The Body and the Soul united then,<br/>A gentle start convulsed Ianthe's frame:<br/>Her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed;<br/>Moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained:<br/>She looked around in wonder and beheld<br/>Henry, who kneeled in silence by her couch,<br/>Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love,<br/>And the bright beaming stars<br/>That through the casement shone.
