<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Old Man by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    OLD Man, or Lad's-love,--in the name there's<br/>   nothing<br/>To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man,<br/>The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree,<br/>Growing with rosemary and lavender.<br/>Even to one that knows it well, the names<br/>Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is:<br/>At least, what that is clings not to the names<br/>In spite of time. And yet I like the names.<br/><br/>The herb itself I like not, but for certain<br/>I love it, as some day the child will love it<br/>Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush<br/>Whenever she goes in or out of the house.<br/>Often she waits there, snipping the tips and<br/>   shrivelling<br/>The shreds at last on to the path, perhaps<br/>Thinking, perhaps of nothing, till she sniffs<br/>Her fingers and runs off. The bush is still<br/>But half as tall as she, though it is as old;<br/>So well she clips it. Not a word she says;<br/>And I can only wonder how much hereafter<br/>She will remember, with that bitter scent,<br/>Of garden rows, and ancient damson-trees<br/>Topping a hedge, a bent path to a door,<br/>A low thick bush beside the door, and me<br/>Forbidding her to pick.<br/><br/>                      As for myself,<br/>Where first I met the bitter scent is lost.<br/>I, too, often shrivel the grey shreds,<br/>Sniff them and think and sniff again and try<br/>Once more to think what it is I am remembering,<br/>Always in vain. I cannot like the scent,<br/>Yet I would rather give up others more sweet,<br/>With no meaning, than this bitter one.<br/><br/>I have mislaid the key. I sniff the spray<br/>And think of nothing; I see and I hear nothing;<br/>Yet seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait<br/>For what I should, yet never can, remember:<br/>No garden appears, no path, no hoar-green bush<br/>Of Lad's-love, or Old Man, no child beside,<br/>Neither father nor mother, nor any playmate;<br/>Only an avenue, dark, nameless, without end.
</p>
