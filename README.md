# üíÆ An Elegy on the Death of Montgomery Tappen by *Major Henry Livingston, Jr.*

<p>
    An elegy on the death of MONTGOMERY TAPPEN who dies at Poughkeepsie on the 20th of Nov. 1784 in the ninth year of his age.<br/><br/><br/>The sweetest, gentlest, of the youthful train,<br/>Here lies his clay cold upon the sable bier!<br/>He scarce had started on life's varied plain,<br/>For dreary death arrested his career.<br/><br/>His cheek might vie with the expanded rose,<br/>And Genius sparkled in his azure eyes!<br/>A victim so unblemish'd Heaven chose,<br/>And bore the beauteous lambkin to the skies.<br/><br/>Adieu thou loveliest child! Adieu adieu!<br/>Our wishes fain would follow thee on high.<br/>What more can friendship - what more fondness do,<br/>But drop the unbidden tear & heave the sigh?<br/><br/>Ye youths whose ardent bosoms virtue fires,<br/>Who eager wish applause and pant for fame,<br/>Press round MONTGOMERY'S hearse, the NAME inspires<br/>And lights in kindred souls its native flame.<br/><br/>COLUMBIA grateful hails the tender sound<br/>And when MONTGOMERY'S nam'd still drops a tear,<br/>From shore to shore to earth's remotest bound<br/>Where LIBERTY is known that NAME is dear.
