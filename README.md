<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Book II. Satire VI. the First Part Imitated in the Year 1714, by Dr by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    SWIFT; THE LATTER PART ADDED AFTERWARDS.<br/><br/>I've often wish'd that I had clear,<br/>For life, six hundred pounds a-year,<br/>A handsome house to lodge a friend,<br/>A river at my garden's end,<br/>A terrace-walk, and half a rood<br/>Of land, set out to plant a wood.<br/><br/>Well, now I have all this and more,<br/>I ask not to increase my store;<br/>But here a grievance seems to lie,<br/>All this is mine but till I die;<br/>I can't but think 'twould sound more clever,<br/>To me and to my heirs for ever.<br/><br/>If I ne'er got or lost a groat,<br/>By any trick, or any fault;<br/>And if I pray by reason's rules,<br/>And not like forty other fools:<br/>As thus, 'Vouchsafe, O gracious Maker!<br/>To grant me this and t' other acre:<br/>Or, if it be thy will and pleasure,<br/>Direct my plough to find a treasure:'<br/>But only what my station fits,<br/>And to be kept in my right wits.<br/>Preserve, Almighty Providence!<br/>Just what you gave me, competence:<br/>And let me in these shades compose<br/>Something in verse as true as prose;<br/>Removed from all the ambitious scene,<br/>Nor puff'd by pride, nor sunk by spleen.<br/><br/>In short, I'm perfectly content,<br/>Let me but live on this side Trent;<br/>Nor cross the Channel twice a-year,<br/>To spend six months with statesmen here.<br/><br/>I must by all means come to town,<br/>'Tis for the service of the crown.<br/>'Lewis, the Dean will be of use,<br/>Send for him up, take no excuse.'<br/>The toil, the danger of the seas;<br/>Great ministers ne'er think of these;<br/>Or let it cost five hundred pound,<br/>No matter where the money's found,<br/>It is but so much more in debt,<br/>And that they ne'er consider'd yet.<br/><br/>'Good Mr Dean, go change your gown,<br/>Let my lord know you're come to town.'<br/>I hurry me in haste away,<br/>Not thinking it is levee-day;<br/>And find his honour in a pound,<br/>Hemm'd by a triple circle round,<br/>Checquer'd with ribbons blue and green:<br/>How should I thrust myself between?<br/>Same wag observes me thus perplex'd,<br/>And smiling, whispers to the next,<br/>'I thought the Dean had been too proud,<br/>To jostle here among a crowd.'<br/>Another in a surly fit,<br/>Tells me I have more zeal than wit,<br/>'So eager to express your love,<br/>You ne'er consider whom you shove,<br/>But rudely press before a duke.'<br/>I own, I'm pleased with this rebuke,<br/>And take it kindly meant to show<br/>What I desire the world should know.<br/><br/>I get a whisper, and withdraw;<br/>When twenty fools I never saw<br/>Come with petitions fairly penn'd,<br/>Desiring I would stand their friend.<br/><br/>This, humbly offers me his case--<br/>That, begs my interest for a place--<br/>A hundred other men's affairs,<br/>Like bees, are humming in my ears.<br/>'To-morrow my appeal comes on,<br/>Without your help the cause is gone'--<br/>The duke expects my lord and you,<br/>About some great affair, at two--<br/>'Put my Lord Bolingbroke in mind,<br/>To get my warrant quickly sign'd:<br/>Consider, 'tis my first request.'--<br/>Be satisfied, I'll do my best:<br/>Then presently he falls to tease,<br/>'You may for certain, if you please;<br/>I doubt not, if his lordship knew--<br/>And, Mr Dean, one word from you'--<br/><br/>'Tis (let me see) three years and more,<br/>(October next it will be four)<br/>Since Harley bid me first attend,<br/>And chose me for an humble friend;<br/>Would take me in his coach to chat,<br/>And question me of this and that;<br/>As, 'What's o'clock?' and, 'How's the wind?'<br/>'Who's chariot's that we left behind?'<br/>Or gravely try to read the lines<br/>Writ underneath the country signs;<br/>Or, 'Have you nothing new to-day<br/>From Pope, from Parnell, or from Gay?'<br/>Such tattle often entertains<br/>My lord and me as far as Staines,<br/>As once a week we travel down<br/>To Windsor, and again to town,<br/>Where all that passes, _inter nos_,<br/>Might be proclaim'd at Charing Cross.<br/><br/>Yet some I know with envy swell,<br/>Because they see me used so well:<br/>'How think you of our friend the dean?<br/>I wonder what some people mean;<br/>My lord and he are grown so great,<br/>Always together, t√™te-√†-t√™te:<br/>What, they admire him for his jokes--<br/>See but the fortune of some folks!'<br/>There flies about a strange report<br/>Of some express arrived at court;<br/>I'm stopp'd by all the fools I meet,<br/>And catechised in every street.<br/>'You, Mr Dean, frequent the great;<br/>Inform us, will the Emperor treat?<br/>Or do the prints and papers lie?'<br/>Faith, sir, you know as much as I.<br/>'Ah, Doctor, how you love to jest!<br/>Tis now no secret'--I protest<br/>'Tis one to me--'Then tell us, pray,<br/>When are the troops to have their pay?'<br/>And, though I solemnly declare<br/>I know no more than my Lord Mayor,<br/>They stand amazed, and think me grown<br/>The closest mortal ever known.<br/><br/>Thus in a sea of folly toss'd,<br/>My choicest hours of life are lost;<br/>Yet always wishing to retreat,<br/>Oh, could I see my country-seat!<br/>There, leaning near a gentle brook,<br/>Sleep, or peruse some ancient book,<br/>And there in sweet oblivion drown<br/>Those cares that haunt the court and town.<br/>O charming noons! and nights divine!<br/>Or when I sup, or when I dine,<br/>My friends above, my folks below,<br/>Chatting and laughing all a-row;<br/>The beans and bacon set before 'em,<br/>The grace-cup served with all decorum:<br/>Each willing to be pleased, and please,<br/>And even the very dogs at ease!<br/>Here no man prates of idle things,<br/>How this or that Italian sings,<br/>A neighbour's madness, or his spouse's,<br/>Or what's in either of the Houses:<br/>But something much more our concern,<br/>And quite a scandal not to learn:<br/>Which is the happier or the wiser,<br/>A man of merit, or a miser?<br/>Whether we ought to choose our friends,<br/>For their own worth, or our own ends?<br/>What good, or better, we may call,<br/>And what, the very best of all?<br/><br/>Our friend Dan Prior told (you know)<br/>A tale extremely _√° propos_:<br/>Name a town life, and in a trice,<br/>He had a story of two mice.<br/>Once on a time (so runs the fable)<br/>A country mouse, right hospitable,<br/>Received a town mouse at his board,<br/>Just as a farmer might a lord.<br/>A frugal mouse upon the whole.<br/>Yet loved his friend, and had a soul,<br/>Knew what was handsome, and would do 't,<br/>On just occasion, co√∫te qui co√∫te,<br/>He brought him bacon (nothing lean);<br/>Pudding, that might have pleased a dean;<br/>Cheese, such as men in Suffolk make,<br/>But wish'd it Stilton, for his sake;<br/>Yet, to his guest though no way sparing,<br/>He eat himself the rind and paring,<br/>Our courtier scarce could touch a bit,<br/>But show'd his breeding and his wit;<br/>He did his best to seem to eat,<br/>And cried, 'I vow you're mighty neat.<br/>But, lord! my friend, this savage scene!<br/>For God's sake, come, and live with men:<br/>Consider, mice, like men, must die,<br/>Both small and great, both you and I:<br/>Then spend your life in joy and sport,<br/>(This doctrine, friend, I learn'd at court).'<br/><br/>The veriest hermit in the nation<br/>May yield, God knows, to strong temptation.<br/>Away they come, through thick and thin,<br/>To a tall house near Lincoln's Inn;<br/>('Twas on the night of a debate,<br/>When all their lordships had sat late.)<br/><br/>Behold the place where, if a poet<br/>Shined in description, he might show it;<br/>Tell how the moonbeam trembling falls,<br/>And tips with silver all the walls;<br/>Palladian walls, Venetian doors,<br/>Grotesco roofs, and stucco floors:<br/>But let it (in a word) be said,<br/>The moon was up, and men a-bed,<br/>The napkins white, the carpet red:<br/>The guests withdrawn had left the treat,<br/>And down the mice sat, _t√™te-√†-t√™te_.<br/><br/>Our courtier walks from dish to dish,<br/>Tastes for his friend of fowl and fish;<br/>Tells all their names, lays down the law,<br/>'_Que √ßa est bon! Ah goutez √ßa!_<br/>That jelly's rich, this malmsey healing,<br/>Pray, dip your whiskers and your tail in.'<br/>Was ever such a happy swain?<br/>He stuffs and swills, and stuffs again.<br/>'I'm quite ashamed--'tis mighty rude<br/>To eat so much--but all's so good.<br/>I have a thousand thanks to give--<br/>My lord alone knows how to live.'<br/>No sooner said, but from the hall<br/>Rush chaplain, butler, dogs, and all:<br/>'A rat! a rat! clap to the door'--<br/>The cat comes bouncing on the floor.<br/>O for the heart of Homer's mice,<br/>Or gods to save them in a trice!<br/>(It was by Providence they think,<br/>For your damn'd stucco has no chink.)<br/>'An't please your honour, quoth the peasant,<br/>This same dessert is not so pleasant:<br/>Give me again my hollow tree,<br/>A crust of bread, and liberty!'
