# üíÆ Spring. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    THE FIRST PASTORAL, OR DAMON.<br/><br/>TO SIR WILLIAM TRUMBULL.<br/><br/>First in these fields I try the sylvan strains,<br/>Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains:<br/>Fair Thames, flow gently from thy sacred spring,<br/>While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing;<br/>Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play,<br/>And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay.<br/><br/>You that, too wise for pride, too good for power,<br/>Enjoy the glory to be great no more,<br/>And, carrying with you all the world can boast,<br/>To all the world illustriously are lost!<br/>Oh, let my Muse her slender reed inspire,<br/>Till in your native shades you tune the lyre:<br/>So when the nightingale to rest removes,<br/>The thrush may chant to the forsaken groves,<br/>But, charm'd to silence, listens while she sings,<br/>And all the a√´rial audience clap their wings.<br/><br/>Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews,<br/>Two swains, whom Love kept wakeful, and the Muse,<br/>Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their fleecy care,<br/>Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair:<br/>The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side,<br/>Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephou thus replied.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>Hear how the birds, on every bloomy spray,<br/>With joyous music wake the dawning day!<br/>Why sit we mute when early linnets sing,<br/>When warbling Philomel salutes the spring?<br/>Why sit we sad, when Phosphor shines so clear,<br/>And lavish Nature paints the purple year?<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>Sing then, and Damon shall attend the strain,<br/>While yon slow oxen turn the furrow'd plain.<br/>Here the bright crocus and blue violet glow;<br/>Here western winds on breathing roses blow.<br/>I'll stake yon lamb, that near the fountain plays,<br/>And from the brink his dancing shade surveys.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>And I this bowl, where wanton ivy twines,<br/>And swelling clusters bend the curling vines:<br/>Four Figures rising from the work appear,<br/>The various Seasons of the rolling year;<br/>And what is that, which binds the radiant sky,<br/>Where twelve fair signs in beauteous order lie?<br/><br/>DAMON.<br/><br/>Then sing by turns, by turns the Muses sing;<br/>Now hawthorns blossom, now the daisies spring;<br/>Now leaves the trees, and flowers adorn the ground:<br/>Begin, the vales shall every note rebound.<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>Inspire me, Phoebus, in my Delia's praise,<br/>With Waller's strains, or Granville's moving lays!<br/>A milk-white bull shall at your altars stand,<br/>That threats a fight, and spurns the rising sand.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>O Love! for Sylvia let me gain the prize,<br/>And make my tongue victorious as her eyes;<br/>No lambs or sheep for victims I'll impart,<br/>Thy victim, Love, shall be the shepherd's heart.<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain,<br/>Then hid in shades, eludes her eager swain;<br/>But feigns a laugh, to see me search around,<br/>And by that laugh the willing fair is found.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green,<br/>She runs, but hopes she does not run unseen;<br/>While a kind glance at her pursuer flies,<br/>How much at variance are her feet and eyes!<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow,<br/>And trees weep amber on the banks of Po;<br/>Blest Thames's shores the brightest beauties yield,<br/>Feed here, my lambs, I'll seek no distant field.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>Celestial Venus haunts Idalia's groves;<br/>Diana Cynthus, Ceres Hybla loves;<br/>If Windsor-shades delight the matchless maid,<br/>Cynthus and Hybla yield to Windsor-shade.<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>All nature mourns, the skies relent in showers,<br/>Hush'd are the birds, and closed the drooping flowers;<br/>If Delia smile, the flowers begin to spring,<br/>The skies to brighten, and the birds to sing.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>All nature laughs, the groves are fresh and fair,<br/>The sun's mild lustre warms the vital air;<br/>If Sylvia smiles, new glories gild the shore,<br/>And vanquish'd Nature seems to charm no more.<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>In spring the fields, in autumn hills I love,<br/>At morn the plains, at noon the shady grove,<br/>But Delia always; absent from her sight,<br/>Nor plains at morn, nor groves at noon delight.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>Sylvia's like autumn ripe, yet mild as May,<br/>More bright than noon, yet fresh as early day;<br/>Even spring displeases, when she shines not here;<br/>But, blest with her, 'tis spring throughout the year.<br/><br/>STREPHON.<br/><br/>Say, Daphnis, say, in what glad soil appears,<br/>A wondrous tree that sacred monarchs bears?<br/>Tell me but this, and I'll disclaim the prize,<br/>And give the conquest to thy Sylvia's eyes.<br/><br/>DAPHNIS.<br/><br/>Nay, tell me first, in what more happy fields<br/>The thistle springs, to which the lily yields?<br/>And then a nobler prize I will resign;<br/>For Sylvia, charming Sylvia shall be thine.<br/><br/>DAMON.<br/><br/>Cease to contend, for, Daphnis, I decree,<br/>The bowl to Strephon, and the lamb to thee:<br/>Blest swains, whose nymphs in every grace excel;<br/>Blest nymphs, whose swains those graces sing so well!<br/>Now rise, and haste to yonder woodbine bowers,<br/>A soft retreat from sudden vernal showers;<br/>The turf with rural dainties shall be crown'd.<br/>While opening blooms diffuse their sweets around.<br/>For see! the gath'ring flocks to shelter tend,<br/>And from the Pleiads fruitful showers descend.
