  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Laboratory (Ancien Regime) by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly,<br/>May gaze through these faint smokes curling whitely,<br/>As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's-smithy--<br/>Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?<br/><br/>He is with her, and they know that I know<br/>Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow<br/>While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear<br/>Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here!<br/><br/>Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste,<br/>Pound at thy powder, I am not in haste!<br/>Better sit thus and observe thy strange things,<br/>Than go where men wait me, and dance at the King's.<br/><br/>That in the mortar--you call it a gum?<br/>Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come!<br/>And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,<br/>Sure to taste sweetly,--is that poison, too?<br/>Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures,<br/>What a wild crowd of Invisible pleasures!<br/>To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,<br/>A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!<br/><br/>Soon, at the King's, a mere lozenge to give<br/>And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live!<br/>But to light a pastille, and Elise, with her head<br/>And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!<br/><br/>Quick--is it finished? The colour's too grim!<br/>Why not soft like the phial's, enticing and dim?<br/>Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir,<br/>And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!<br/><br/>What a drop! She's not little, no minion like me!<br/>That's why she ensnared him: this never will free<br/>The soul from those masculine eyes,--say "No!"<br/>To that pulse's magnificent come-and-go.<br/><br/>For only last night, as they whispered, I brought<br/>My own eyes to bear on her so that I thought<br/>Could I keep them one half-minute fixed, she would fall<br/>Shrivelled; she fell not: yet this does it all!<br/><br/>Not that I bid you spare her the pain;<br/>Let death be felt and the proof remain:<br/>Brand, burn up, bite into its grace--<br/>He is sure to remember her dying face!<br/><br/>Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;<br/>It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close:<br/>The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee!<br/>If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?<br/><br/>Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill,<br/>You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!<br/>But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings<br/>Ere I know it--next moment I dance at the King's!
</p>
