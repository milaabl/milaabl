# üíÆ Prince Athanase.  a Fragment by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    PART 1.<br/><br/>There was a youth, who, as with toil and travel,<br/>Had grown quite weak and gray before his time;<br/>Nor any could the restless griefs unravel<br/><br/>Which burned within him, withering up his prime<br/>And goading him, like fiends, from land to land.<br/>Not his the load of any secret crime,<br/><br/>For nought of ill his heart could understand,<br/>But pity and wild sorrow for the same;--<br/>Not his the thirst for glory or command,<br/><br/>Baffled with blast of hope-consuming shame;<br/>Nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast,<br/>And quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame,<br/><br/>Had left within his soul their dark unrest:<br/>Nor what religion fables of the grave<br/>Feared he,--Philosophy's accepted guest.<br/><br/>For none than he a purer heart could have,<br/>Or that loved good more for itself alone;<br/>Of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave.<br/><br/>What sorrow, strange, and shadowy, and unknown,<br/>Sent him, a hopeless wanderer, through mankind?--<br/>If with a human sadness he did groan,<br/><br/>He had a gentle yet aspiring mind;<br/>Just, innocent, with varied learning fed;<br/>And such a glorious consolation find<br/><br/>In others' joy, when all their own is dead:<br/>He loved, and laboured for his kind in grief,<br/>And yet, unlike all others, it is said<br/><br/>That from such toil he never found relief.<br/>Although a child of fortune and of power,<br/>Of an ancestral name the orphan chief,<br/><br/>His soul had wedded Wisdom, and her dower<br/>Is love and justice, clothed in which he sate<br/>Apart from men, as in a lonely tower,<br/><br/>Pitying the tumult of their dark estate.--<br/>Yet even in youth did he not e'er abuse<br/>The strength of wealth or thought, to consecrate<br/><br/>Those false opinions which the harsh rich use<br/>To blind the world they famish for their pride;<br/>Nor did he hold from any man his dues,<br/><br/>But, like a steward in honest dealings tried,<br/>With those who toiled and wept, the poor and wise,<br/>His riches and his cares he did divide.<br/><br/>Fearless he was, and scorning all disguise,<br/>What he dared do or think, though men might start,<br/>He spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes;<br/><br/>Liberal he was of soul, and frank of heart,<br/>And to his many friends--all loved him well--<br/>Whate'er he knew or felt he would impart,<br/><br/>If words he found those inmost thoughts to tell;<br/>If not, he smiled or wept; and his weak foes<br/>He neither spurned nor hated--though with fell<br/><br/>And mortal hate their thousand voices rose,<br/>They passed like aimless arrows from his ear--<br/>Nor did his heart or mind its portal close<br/><br/>To those, or them, or any, whom life's sphere<br/>May comprehend within its wide array.<br/>What sadness made that vernal spirit sere?--<br/><br/>He knew not. Though his life, day after day,<br/>Was failing like an unreplenished stream,<br/>Though in his eyes a cloud and burthen lay,<br/><br/>Through which his soul, like Vesper's serene beam<br/>Piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds,<br/>Shone, softly burning; though his lips did seem<br/><br/>Like reeds which quiver in impetuous floods;<br/>And through his sleep, and o'er each waking hour,<br/>Thoughts after thoughts, unresting multitudes,<br/><br/>Were driven within him by some secret power,<br/>Which bade them blaze, and live, and roll afar,<br/>Like lights and sounds, from haunted tower to tower<br/><br/>O'er castled mountains borne, when tempest's war<br/>Is levied by the night-contending winds,<br/>And the pale dalesmen watch with eager ear;--<br/><br/>Though such were in his spirit, as the fiends<br/>Which wake and feed an everliving woe,--<br/>What was this grief, which ne'er in other minds<br/><br/>A mirror found,--he knew not--none could know;<br/>But on whoe'er might question him he turned<br/>The light of his frank eyes, as if to show<br/><br/>He knew not of the grief within that burned,<br/>But asked forbearance with a mournful look;<br/>Or spoke in words from which none ever learned<br/><br/>The cause of his disquietude; or shook<br/>With spasms of silent passion; or turned pale:<br/>So that his friends soon rarely undertook<br/><br/>To stir his secret pain without avail;--<br/>For all who knew and loved him then perceived<br/>That there was drawn an adamantine veil<br/><br/>Between his heart and mind,--both unrelieved<br/>Wrought in his brain and bosom separate strife.<br/>Some said that he was mad, others believed<br/><br/>That memories of an antenatal life<br/>Made this, where now he dwelt, a penal hell;<br/>And others said that such mysterious grief<br/><br/>From God's displeasure, like a darkness, fell<br/>On souls like his, which owned no higher law<br/>Than love; love calm, steadfast, invincible<br/><br/>By mortal fear or supernatural awe;<br/>And others,--''Tis the shadow of a dream<br/>Which the veiled eye of Memory never saw,<br/><br/>'But through the soul's abyss, like some dark stream<br/>Through shattered mines and caverns underground,<br/>Rolls, shaking its foundations; and no beam<br/><br/>'Of joy may rise, but it is quenched and drowned<br/>In the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure;<br/>Soon its exhausted waters will have found<br/><br/>'A lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure,<br/>O Athanase!--in one so good and great,<br/>Evil or tumult cannot long endure.<br/><br/>So spake they: idly of another's state<br/>Babbling vain words and fond philosophy;<br/>This was their consolation; such debate<br/><br/>Men held with one another; nor did he,<br/>Like one who labours with a human woe,<br/>Decline this talk: as if its theme might be<br/><br/>Another, not himself, he to and fro<br/>Questioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit;<br/>And none but those who loved him best could know<br/><br/>That which he knew not, how it galled and bit<br/>His weary mind, this converse vain and cold;<br/>For like an eyeless nightmare grief did sit<br/><br/>Upon his being; a snake which fold by fold<br/>Pressed out the life of life, a clinging fiend<br/>Which clenched him if he stirred with deadlier hold;--<br/>And so his grief remained--let it remain--untold. [1]<br/><br/>PART 2.<br/><br/>FRAGMENT 1.<br/><br/>Prince Athanase had one beloved friend,<br/>An old, old man, with hair of silver white,<br/>And lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend<br/><br/>With his wise words; and eyes whose arrowy light<br/>Shone like the reflex of a thousand minds.<br/>He was the last whom superstition's blight<br/><br/>Had spared in Greece--the blight that cramps and blinds,--<br/>And in his olive bower at Oenoe<br/>Had sate from earliest youth. Like one who finds<br/><br/>A fertile island in the barren sea,<br/>One mariner who has survived his mates<br/>Many a drear month in a great ship--so he<br/><br/>With soul-sustaining songs, and sweet debates<br/>Of ancient lore, there fed his lonely being:--<br/>'The mind becomes that which it contemplates,'--<br/><br/>And thus Zonoras, by for ever seeing<br/>Their bright creations, grew like wisest men;<br/>And when he heard the crash of nations fleeing<br/><br/>A bloodier power than ruled thy ruins then,<br/>O sacred Hellas! many weary years<br/>He wandered, till the path of Laian's glen<br/><br/>Was grass-grown--and the unremembered tears<br/>Were dry in Laian for their honoured chief,<br/>Who fell in Byzant, pierced by Moslem spears:--<br/><br/>And as the lady looked with faithful grief<br/>From her high lattice o'er the rugged path,<br/>Where she once saw that horseman toil, with brief<br/><br/>And blighting hope, who with the news of death<br/>Struck body and soul as with a mortal blight,<br/>She saw between the chestnuts, far beneath,<br/><br/>An old man toiling up, a weary wight;<br/>And soon within her hospitable hall<br/>She saw his white hairs glittering in the light<br/><br/>Of the wood fire, and round his shoulders fall;<br/>And his wan visage and his withered mien,<br/>Yet calm and gentle and majestical.<br/><br/>And Athanase, her child, who must have been<br/>Then three years old, sate opposite and gazed<br/>In patient silence.<br/><br/>FRAGMENT 2.<br/><br/>Such was Zonoras; and as daylight finds<br/>One amaranth glittering on the path of frost,<br/>When autumn nights have nipped all weaker kinds,<br/><br/>Thus through his age, dark, cold, and tempest-tossed,<br/>Shone truth upon Zonoras; and he filled<br/>From fountains pure, nigh overgrown and lost,<br/><br/>The spirit of Prince Athanase, a child,<br/>With soul-sustaining songs of ancient lore<br/>And philosophic wisdom, clear and mild.<br/><br/>And sweet and subtle talk they evermore,<br/>The pupil and the master, shared; until,<br/>Sharing that undiminishable store,<br/><br/>The youth, as shadows on a grassy hill<br/>Outrun the winds that chase them, soon outran<br/>His teacher, and did teach with native skill<br/><br/>Strange truths and new to that experienced man;<br/>Still they were friends, as few have ever been<br/>Who mark the extremes of life's discordant span.<br/><br/>So in the caverns of the forest green,<br/>Or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar,<br/>Zonoras and Prince Athanase were seen<br/><br/>By summer woodmen; and when winter's roar<br/>Sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war,<br/>The Balearic fisher, driven from shore,<br/><br/>Hanging upon the peaked wave afar,<br/>Then saw their lamp from Laian's turret gleam,<br/>Piercing the stormy darkness, like a star<br/><br/>Which pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam,<br/>Whilst all the constellations of the sky<br/>Seemed reeling through the storm...They did but seem--<br/><br/>For, lo! the wintry clouds are all gone by,<br/>And bright Arcturus through yon pines is glowing,<br/>And far o'er southern waves, immovably<br/><br/>Belted Orion hangs--warm light is flowing<br/>From the young moon into the sunset's chasm.--<br/>'O, summer eve! with power divine, bestowing<br/><br/>'On thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm<br/>Which overflows in notes of liquid gladness,<br/>Filling the sky like light! How many a spasm<br/><br/>'Of fevered brains, oppressed with grief and madness,<br/>Were lulled by thee, delightful nightingale,--<br/>And these soft waves, murmuring a gentle sadness,--<br/><br/>'And the far sighings of yon piny dale<br/>Made vocal by some wind we feel not here.--<br/>I bear alone what nothing may avail<br/><br/>'To lighten--a strange load!'--No human ear<br/>Heard this lament; but o'er the visage wan<br/>Of Athanase, a ruffling atmosphere<br/><br/>Of dark emotion, a swift shadow, ran,<br/>Like wind upon some forest-bosomed lake,<br/>Glassy and dark.--And that divine old man<br/><br/>Beheld his mystic friend's whole being shake,<br/>Even where its inmost depths were gloomiest--<br/>And with a calm and measured voice he spake,<br/><br/>And, with a soft and equal pressure, pressed<br/>That cold lean hand:--'Dost thou remember yet<br/>When the curved moon then lingering in the west<br/><br/>'Paused, in yon waves her mighty horns to wet,<br/>How in those beams we walked, half resting on the sea?<br/>'Tis just one year--sure thou dost not forget--<br/><br/>'Then Plato's words of light in thee and me<br/>Lingered like moonlight in the moonless east,<br/>For we had just then read--thy memory<br/><br/>'Is faithful now--the story of the feast;<br/>And Agathon and Diotima seemed<br/>From death and dark forgetfulness released...'<br/><br/>FRAGMENT 3.<br/><br/>And when the old man saw that on the green<br/>Leaves of his opening ... a blight had lighted<br/>He said: 'My friend, one grief alone can wean<br/><br/>A gentle mind from all that once delighted:--<br/>Thou lovest, and thy secret heart is laden<br/>With feelings which should not be unrequited.'<br/><br/>And Athanase ... then smiled, as one o'erladen<br/>With iron chains might smile to talk (?) of bands<br/>Twined round her lover's neck by some blithe maiden,<br/>And said...<br/><br/>FRAGMENT 4.<br/><br/>'Twas at the season when the Earth upsprings<br/>From slumber, as a sphered angel's child,<br/>Shadowing its eyes with green and golden wings,<br/><br/>Stands up before its mother bright and mild,<br/>Of whose soft voice the air expectant seems--<br/>So stood before the sun, which shone and smiled<br/><br/>To see it rise thus joyous from its dreams,<br/>The fresh and radiant Earth. The hoary grove<br/>Waxed green--and flowers burst forth like starry beams;--<br/><br/>The grass in the warm sun did start and move,<br/>And sea-buds burst under the waves serene:--<br/>How many a one, though none be near to love,<br/><br/>Loves then the shade of his own soul, half seen<br/>In any mirror--or the spring's young minions,<br/>The winged leaves amid the copses green;--<br/><br/>How many a spirit then puts on the pinions<br/>Of fancy, and outstrips the lagging blast,<br/>And his own steps--and over wide dominions<br/><br/>Sweeps in his dream-drawn chariot, far and fast,<br/>More fleet than storms--the wide world shrinks below,<br/>When winter and despondency are past.<br/><br/>FRAGMENT 5.<br/><br/>'Twas at this season that Prince Athanase<br/>Passed the white Alps--those eagle-baffling mountains<br/>Slept in their shrouds of snow;--beside the ways<br/><br/>The waterfalls were voiceless--for their fountains<br/>Were changed to mines of sunless crystal now,<br/>Or by the curdling winds--like brazen wings<br/><br/>Which clanged along the mountain's marble brow--<br/>Warped into adamantine fretwork, hung<br/>And filled with frozen light the chasms below.<br/><br/>Vexed by the blast, the great pines groaned and swung<br/>Under their load of --<br/>...<br/>...<br/>Such as the eagle sees, when he dives down<br/>From the gray deserts of wide air,<br/> Athanase; and o'er his mien (?) was thrown<br/><br/>The shadow of that scene, field after field,<br/>Purple and dim and wide...<br/><br/>FRAGMENT 6.<br/><br/>Thou art the wine whose drunkenness is all<br/>We can desire, O Love! and happy souls,<br/>Ere from thy vine the leaves of autumn fall,<br/><br/>Catch thee, and feed from their o'erflowing bowls<br/>Thousands who thirst for thine ambrosial dew;--<br/>Thou art the radiance which where ocean rolls<br/><br/>Investeth it; and when the heavens are blue<br/>Thou fillest them; and when the earth is fair<br/>The shadow of thy moving wings imbue<br/><br/>Its deserts and its mountains, till they wear<br/>Beauty like some light robe;--thou ever soarest<br/>Among the towers of men, and as soft air<br/><br/>In spring, which moves the unawakened forest,<br/>Clothing with leaves its branches bare and bleak,<br/>Thou floatest among men; and aye implorest<br/><br/>That which from thee they should implore:--the weak<br/>Alone kneel to thee, offering up the hearts<br/>The strong have broken--yet where shall any seek<br/><br/>A garment whom thou clothest not? the darts<br/>Of the keen winter storm, barbed with frost,<br/>Which, from the everlasting snow that parts<br/><br/>The Alps from Heaven, pierce some traveller lost<br/>In the wide waved interminable snow<br/>Ungarmented,...<br/><br/>ANOTHER FRAGMENT (A)<br/><br/>Yes, often when the eyes are cold and dry,<br/>And the lips calm, the Spirit weeps within<br/>Tears bitterer than the blood of agony<br/><br/>Trembling in drops on the discoloured skin<br/>Of those who love their kind and therefore perish<br/>In ghastly torture--a sweet medicine<br/><br/>Of peace and sleep are tears, and quietly<br/>Them soothe from whose uplifted eyes they fall<br/>But...<br/><br/>ANOTHER FRAGMENT (B)<br/><br/>Her hair was brown, her sphered eyes were brown,<br/>And in their dark and liquid moisture swam,<br/>Like the dim orb of the eclipsed moon;<br/><br/>Yet when the spirit flashed beneath, there came<br/>The light from them, as when tears of delight<br/>Double the western planet's serene flame.
