  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ At A Solemn Musick by *John Milton*

<p>
    Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav'ns joy,<br/>Sphear-born harmonious Sisters, Voice, and Vers,<br/>Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ<br/>Dead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce,<br/>And to our high-rais'd phantasie present,<br/>That undisturbed Song of pure content,<br/>Ay sung before the saphire-colour'd throne<br/>To him that sits theron<br/>With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubily,<br/>Where the bright Seraphim in burning row<br/>Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow,<br/>And the Cherubick host in thousand quires<br/>Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires,<br/>With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms,<br/>Hymns devout and holy Psalms<br/>Singing everlastingly;<br/>That we on Earth with undiscording voice<br/>May rightly answer that melodious noise;<br/>As  once we did, till disproportion'd sin<br/>Jarr'd against natures chime, and with harsh din<br/>The fair musick that all creatures made<br/>To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway'd<br/>In perfect Diapason, whilst they stood<br/>In first obedience, and their state of good.<br/>O may we soon again renew that Song,<br/>And keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long<br/>To his celestial consort us unite,<br/>To live with him, and sing in endles morn of light.<br/><br/>Note: 6 content]  Manuscript reads concent as does the Second<br/>Edition; so that content is probably a misprint.
</p>
