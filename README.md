# üíÆ The Vision of Judgment.  by Quevedo Redivivus by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
          SUGGESTED BY THE COMPOSITION SO ENTITLED BY THE AUTHOR<br/>                          OF "WAT TYLER."<br/><br/>"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!<br/>I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word."<br/><br/>                [_Merchant of Venice_, act iv. sc. 1, lines 218, 336.<br/><br/>" fools rush in where angels fear to tread."<br/><br/>                              [POPE'S _Essay on Criticism_, line 625.<br/><br/>Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate:<br/>  His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull,<br/>So little trouble had been given of late;<br/>  Not that the place by any means was full,<br/>But since the Gallic era "eighty-eight"<br/>  The Devils had ta'en a longer, stronger pull,<br/>And "a pull altogether," as they say<br/>At sea--which drew most souls another way.<br/><br/>The Angels all were singing out of tune,<br/>  And hoarse with having little else to do,<br/>Excepting to wind up the sun and moon,<br/>  Or curb a runaway young star or two,<br/>Or wild colt of a comet, which too soon<br/>  Broke out of bounds o'er the ethereal blue,<br/>Splitting some planet with its playful tail,<br/>As boats are sometimes by a wanton whale.<br/><br/>The Guardian Seraphs had retired on high,<br/>  Finding their charges past all care below;<br/>Terrestrial business filled nought in the sky<br/>  Save the Recording Angel's black bureau;<br/>Who found, indeed, the facts to multiply<br/>  With such rapidity of vice and woe,<br/>That he had stripped off both his wings in quills,<br/>And yet was in arrear of human ills.<br/><br/>His business so augmented of late years,<br/>  That he was forced, against his will, no doubt,<br/>(Just like those cherubs, earthly ministers,)<br/>  For some resource to turn himself about,<br/>And claim the help of his celestial peers,<br/>  To aid him ere he should be quite worn out<br/>By the increased demand for his remarks:<br/>Six Angels and twelve Saints were named his clerks.<br/><br/>This was a handsome board--at least for Heaven;<br/>  And yet they had even then enough to do,<br/>So many Conquerors' cars were daily driven,<br/>  So many kingdoms fitted up anew;<br/>Each day, too, slew its thousands six or seven,<br/>  Till at the crowning carnage, Waterloo,<br/>They threw their pens down in divine disgust--<br/>The page was so besmeared with blood and dust.<br/><br/>This by the way; 'tis not mine to record<br/>  What Angels shrink from: even the very Devil<br/>On this occasion his own work abhorred,<br/>  So surfeited with the infernal revel:<br/>Though he himself had sharpened every sword,<br/>  It almost quenched his innate thirst of evil.<br/>(Here Satan's sole good work deserves insertion--<br/>'Tis, that he has both Generals in reversion.)<br/><br/>Let's skip a few short years of hollow peace,<br/>  Which peopled earth no better, Hell as wont,<br/>And Heaven none--they form the tyrant's lease,<br/>  With nothing but new names subscribed upon't;<br/>'Twill one day finish: meantime they increase,<br/>  "With seven heads and ten horns," and all in front,<br/>Like Saint John's foretold beast; but ours are born<br/>Less formidable in the head than horn.<br/><br/>In the first year of Freedom's second dawn<br/>  Died George the Third; although no tyrant, one<br/>Who shielded tyrants, till each sense withdrawn<br/>  Left him nor mental nor external sun:<br/>A better farmer ne'er brushed dew from lawn,<br/>  A worse king never left a realm undone!<br/>He died--but left his subjects still behind,<br/>One half as mad--and t'other no less blind.<br/><br/>He died! his death made no great stir on earth:<br/>  His burial made some pomp; there was profusion<br/>Of velvet--gilding--brass--and no great dearth<br/>  Of aught but tears--save those shed by collusion:<br/>For these things may be bought at their true worth;<br/>  Of elegy there was the due infusion--<br/>Bought also; and the torches, cloaks and banners,<br/>Heralds, and relics of old Gothic manners,<br/><br/>Formed a sepulchral melodrame. Of all<br/>  The fools who flocked to swell or see the show,<br/>Who cared about the corpse? The funeral<br/>  Made the attraction, and the black the woe,<br/>There throbbed not there a thought which pierced the pall;<br/>  And when the gorgeous coffin was laid low,<br/>It seemed the mockery of hell to fold<br/>The rottenness of eighty years in gold.<br/><br/>So mix his body with the dust! It might<br/>  Return to what it _must_ far sooner, were<br/>The natural compound left alone to fight<br/>  Its way back into earth, and fire, and air;<br/>But the unnatural balsams merely blight<br/>  What Nature made him at his birth, as bare<br/>As the mere million's base unmummied clay--<br/>Yet all his spices but prolong decay.<br/><br/>He's dead--and upper earth with him has done;<br/>  He's buried; save the undertaker's bill,<br/>Or lapidary scrawl, the world is gone<br/>  For him, unless he left a German will:<br/>But where's the proctor who will ask his son?<br/>  In whom his qualities are reigning still,<br/>Except that household virtue, most uncommon,<br/>Of constancy to a bad, ugly woman.<br/><br/>"God save the king!" It is a large economy<br/>  In God to save the like; but if he will<br/>Be saving, all the better; for not one am I<br/>  Of those who think damnation better still:<br/>I hardly know too if not quite alone am I<br/>  In this small hope of bettering future ill<br/>By circumscribing, with some slight restriction,<br/>The eternity of Hell's hot jurisdiction.<br/><br/>I know this is unpopular; I know<br/>  'Tis blasphemous; I know one may be damned<br/>For hoping no one else may e'er be so;<br/>  I know my catechism; I know we're crammed<br/>With the best doctrines till we quite o'erflow;<br/>  I know that all save England's Church have shammed,<br/>And that the other twice two hundred churches<br/>And synagogues have made a _damned_ bad purchase.<br/><br/>God help us all! God help me too! I am,<br/>  God knows, as helpless as the Devil can wish,<br/>And not a whit more difficult to damn,<br/>  Than is to bring to land a late-hooked fish,<br/>Or to the butcher to purvey the lamb;<br/>  Not that I'm fit for such a noble dish,<br/>As one day will be that immortal fry<br/>Of almost every body born to die.<br/><br/>Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate,<br/>  And nodded o'er his keys: when, lo! there came<br/>A wondrous noise he had not heard of late--<br/>  A rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame;<br/>In short, a roar of things extremely great,<br/>  Which would have made aught save a Saint exclaim;<br/>But he, with first a start and then a wink,<br/>Said, "There's another star gone out, I think!"<br/><br/>But ere he could return to his repose,<br/>  A Cherub flapped his right wing o'er his eyes--<br/>At which Saint Peter yawned, and rubbed his nose:<br/>  "Saint porter," said the angel, "prithee rise!"<br/>Waving a goodly wing, which glowed, as glows<br/>  An earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes:<br/>To which the saint replied, "Well, what's the matter?<br/>"Is Lucifer come back with all this clatter?"<br/><br/>"No," quoth the Cherub: "George the Third is dead."<br/>  "And who _is_ George the Third?" replied the apostle:<br/>"_What George? what Third?_" "The King of England," said<br/>  The angel. "Well! he won't find kings to jostle<br/>Him on his way; but does he wear his head?<br/>  Because the last we saw here had a tustle,<br/>And ne'er would have got into Heaven's good graces,<br/>Had he not flung his head in all our faces.<br/><br/>"He was--if I remember--King of France;<br/>  That head of his, which could not keep a crown<br/>On earth, yet ventured in my face to advance<br/>  A claim to those of martyrs--like my own:<br/>If I had had my sword, as I had once<br/>  When I cut ears off, I had cut him down;<br/>But having but my _keys_, and not my brand,<br/>I only knocked his head from out his hand.<br/><br/>"And then he set up such a headless howl,<br/>  That all the Saints came out and took him in;<br/>And there he sits by Saint Paul, cheek by jowl;<br/>  That fellow Paul--the parven√π! The skin<br/>Of Saint Bartholomew, which makes his cowl<br/>  In heaven, and upon earth redeemed his sin,<br/>So as to make a martyr, never sped<br/>Better than did this weak and wooden head.<br/><br/>"But had it come up here upon its shoulders,<br/>  There would have been a different tale to tell:<br/>The fellow-feeling in the Saint's beholders<br/>  Seems to have acted on them like a spell;<br/>And so this very foolish head Heaven solders<br/>  Back on its trunk: it may be very well,<br/>And seems the custom here to overthrow<br/>Whatever has been wisely done below."<br/><br/>The Angel answered, "Peter! do not pout:<br/>  The King who comes has head and all entire,<br/>And never knew much what it was about--<br/>  He did as doth the puppet--by its wire,<br/>And will be judged like all the rest, no doubt:<br/>  My business and your own is not to inquire<br/>Into such matters, but to mind our cue--<br/>Which is to act as we are bid to do."<br/><br/>While thus they spake, the angelic caravan,<br/>  Arriving like a rush of mighty wind,<br/>Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan<br/>  Some silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde,<br/>Or Thames, or Tweed), and midst them an old man<br/>  With an old soul, and both extremely blind,<br/>Halted before the gate, and, in his shroud,<br/>Seated their fellow-traveller on a cloud.<br/><br/>But bringing up the rear of this bright host<br/>  A Spirit of a different aspect waved<br/>His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast<br/>  Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved;<br/>His brow was like the deep when tempest-tossed;<br/>  Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved<br/>Eternal wrath on his immortal face,<br/>And _where_ he gazed a gloom pervaded space.<br/><br/>As he drew near, he gazed upon the gate<br/>  Ne'er to be entered more by him or Sin,<br/>With such a glance of supernatural hate,<br/>  As made Saint Peter wish himself within;<br/>He pottered with his keys at a great rate,<br/>  And sweated through his Apostolic skin:<br/>Of course his perspiration was but ichor,<br/>Or some such other spiritual liquor.<br/><br/>The very Cherubs huddled all together,<br/>  Like birds when soars the falcon; and they felt<br/>A tingling to the tip of every feather,<br/>  And formed a circle like Orion's belt<br/>Around their poor old charge; who scarce knew whither<br/>  His guards had led him, though they gently dealt<br/>With royal Manes (for by many stories,<br/>And true, we learn the Angels all are Tories).<br/><br/>As things were in this posture, the gate flew<br/>  Asunder, and the flashing of its hinges<br/>Flung over space an universal hue<br/>  Of many-coloured flame, until its tinges<br/>Reached even our speck of earth, and made a new<br/>  Aurora borealis spread its fringes<br/>O'er the North Pole; the same seen, when ice-bound,<br/>By Captain Parry's crew, in "Melville's Sound."<br/><br/>And from the gate thrown open issued beaming<br/>  A beautiful and mighty Thing of Light,<br/>Radiant with glory, like a banner streaming<br/>  Victorious from some world-o'erthrowing fight:<br/>My poor comparisons must needs be teeming<br/>  With earthly likenesses, for here the night<br/>Of clay obscures our best conceptions, saving<br/>Johanna Southcote, or Bob Southey raving.<br/><br/>'Twas the Archangel Michael: all men know<br/>  The make of Angels and Archangels, since<br/>There's scarce a scribbler has not one to show,<br/>  From the fiends' leader to the Angels' Prince.<br/>There also are some altar-pieces, though<br/>  I really can't say that they much evince<br/>One's inner notions of immortal spirits;<br/>But let the connoisseurs explain _their_ merits.<br/><br/>Michael flew forth in glory and in good;<br/>  A goodly work of him from whom all Glory<br/>And Good arise; the portal past--he stood;<br/>  Before him the young Cherubs and Saints hoary--<br/>(I say _young_, begging to be understood<br/>  By looks, not years; and should be very sorry<br/>To state, they were not older than St. Peter,<br/>But merely that they seemed a little sweeter).<br/><br/>The Cherubs and the Saints bowed down before<br/>  That arch-angelic Hierarch, the first<br/>Of Essences angelical who wore<br/>  The aspect of a god; but this ne'er nursed<br/>Pride in his heavenly bosom, in whose core<br/>  No thought, save for his Maker's service, durst<br/>Intrude, however glorified and high;<br/>He knew him but the Viceroy of the sky.<br/><br/>He and the sombre, silent Spirit met--<br/>  They knew each other both for good and ill;<br/>Such was their power, that neither could forget<br/>  His former friend and future foe; but still<br/>There was a high, immortal, proud regret<br/>  In either's eye, as if 'twere less their will<br/>Than destiny to make the eternal years<br/>Their date of war, and their "Champ Clos" the spheres.<br/><br/>But here they were in neutral space: we know<br/>  From Job, that Satan hath the power to pay<br/>A heavenly visit thrice a-year or so;<br/>  And that the "Sons of God," like those of clay,<br/>Must keep him company; and we might show<br/>  From the same book, in how polite a way<br/>The dialogue is held between the Powers<br/>Of Good and Evil--but 'twould take up hours.<br/><br/>And this is not a theologic tract,<br/>  To prove with Hebrew and with Arabic,<br/>If Job be allegory or a fact,<br/>  But a true narrative; and thus I pick<br/>From out the whole but such and such an act<br/>  As sets aside the slightest thought of trick.<br/>'Tis every tittle true, beyond suspicion,<br/>And accurate as any other vision.<br/><br/>The spirits were in neutral space, before<br/>  The gate of Heaven; like eastern thresholds is<br/>The place where Death's grand cause is argued o'er,<br/>  And souls despatched to that world or to this;<br/>And therefore Michael and the other wore<br/>  A civil aspect: though they did not kiss,<br/>Yet still between his Darkness and his Brightness<br/>There passed a mutual glance of great politeness.<br/><br/>The Archangel bowed, not like a modern beau,<br/>  But with a graceful oriental bend,<br/>Pressing one radiant arm just where below<br/>  The heart in good men is supposed to tend;<br/>He turned as to an equal, not too low,<br/>  But kindly; Satan met his ancient friend<br/>With more hauteur, as might an old Castilian<br/>Poor Noble meet a mushroom rich civilian.<br/><br/>He merely bent his diabolic brow<br/>  An instant; and then raising it, he stood<br/>In act to assert his right or wrong, and show<br/>  Cause why King George by no means could or should<br/>Make out a case to be exempt from woe<br/>  Eternal, more than other kings, endued<br/>With better sense and hearts, whom History mentions,<br/>Who long have "paved Hell with their good intentions."<br/><br/>Michael began: "What wouldst thou with this man,<br/>  Now dead, and brought before the Lord? What ill<br/>Hath he wrought since his mortal race began,<br/>  That thou canst claim him? Speak! and do thy will,<br/>If it be just: if in this earthly span<br/>  He hath been greatly failing to fulfil<br/>His duties as a king and mortal, say,<br/>And he is thine; if not--let him have way."<br/><br/>"Michael!" replied the Prince of Air, "even here<br/>  Before the gate of Him thou servest, must<br/>I claim my subject: and will make appear<br/>  That as he was my worshipper in dust,<br/>So shall he be in spirit, although dear<br/>  To thee and thine, because nor wine nor lust<br/>Were of his weaknesses; yet on the throne<br/>He reigned o'er millions to serve me alone.<br/><br/>"Look to _our_ earth, or rather _mine_; it was,<br/>  _Once, more_ thy master's: but I triumph not<br/>In this poor planet's conquest; nor, alas!<br/>  Need he thou servest envy me my lot:<br/>With all the myriads of bright worlds which pass<br/>  In worship round him, he may have forgot<br/>Yon weak creation of such paltry things:<br/>I think few worth damnation save their kings,<br/><br/>"And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to<br/>  Assert my right as Lord: and even had<br/>I such an inclination,'twere (as you<br/>  Well know) superfluous; they are grown so bad,<br/>That Hell has nothing better left to do<br/>  Than leave them to themselves: so much more mad<br/>And evil by their own internal curse,<br/>Heaven cannot make them better, nor I worse.<br/><br/>"Look to the earth, I said, and say again:<br/>  When this old, blind, mad, helpless, weak, poor worm<br/>Began in youth's first bloom and flush to reign,<br/>  The world and he both wore a different form,<br/>And much of earth and all the watery plain<br/>  Of Ocean called him king: through many a storm<br/>His isles had floated on the abyss of Time;<br/>For the rough virtues chose them for their clime.<br/><br/>"He came to his sceptre young; he leaves it old:<br/>  Look to the state in which he found his realm,<br/>And left it; and his annals too behold,<br/>  How to a minion first he gave the helm;<br/>How grew upon his heart a thirst for gold,<br/>  The beggar's vice, which can but overwhelm<br/>The meanest hearts; and for the rest, but glance<br/>Thine eye along America and France.<br/><br/>"'Tis true, he was a tool from first to last<br/>  (I have the workmen safe); but as a tool<br/>So let him be consumed. From out the past<br/>  Of ages, since mankind have known the rule<br/>Of monarchs--from the bloody rolls amassed<br/>  Of Sin and Slaughter--from the C√¶sars' school,<br/>Take the worst pupil; and produce a reign<br/>More drenched with gore, more cumbered with the slain.<br/><br/>"He ever warred with freedom and the free:<br/>  Nations as men, home subjects, foreign foes,<br/>So that they uttered the word 'Liberty!'<br/>  Found George the Third their first opponent. Whose<br/>History was ever stained as his will be<br/>  With national and individual woes?<br/>I grant his household abstinence; I grant<br/>His neutral virtues, which most monarchs want;<br/><br/>"I know he was a constant consort; own<br/>  He was a decent sire, and middling lord.<br/>All this is much, and most upon a throne;<br/>  As temperance, if at Apicius' board,<br/>Is more than at an anchorite's supper shown.<br/>  I grant him all the kindest can accord;<br/>And this was well for him, but not for those<br/>Millions who found him what Oppression chose.<br/><br/>"The New World shook him off; the Old yet groans<br/>  Beneath what he and his prepared, if not<br/>Completed: he leaves heirs on many thrones<br/>  To all his vices, without what begot<br/>Compassion for him--his tame virtues; drones<br/>  Who sleep, or despots who have now forgot<br/>A lesson which shall be re-taught them, wake<br/>Upon the thrones of earth; but let them quake!<br/><br/>"Five millions of the primitive, who hold<br/>  The faith which makes ye great on earth, implored<br/>A _part_ of that vast _all_ they held of old,--<br/>  Freedom to worship--not alone your Lord,<br/>Michael, but you, and you, Saint Peter! Cold<br/>  Must be your souls, if you have not abhorred<br/>The foe to Catholic participation<br/>In all the license of a Christian nation.<br/><br/>"True! he allowed them to pray God; but as<br/>  A consequence of prayer, refused the law<br/>Which would have placed them upon the same base<br/>  With those who did not hold the Saints in awe."<br/>But here Saint Peter started from his place<br/>  And cried, "You may the prisoner withdraw:<br/>Ere Heaven shall ope her portals to this Guelph,<br/>While I am guard, may I be damned myself!<br/><br/>"Sooner will I with Cerberus exchange<br/>  My office (and _his_ is no sinecure)<br/>Than see this royal Bedlam-bigot range<br/>  The azure fields of Heaven, of that be sure!"<br/>"Saint!" replied Satan, "you do well to avenge<br/>  The wrongs he made your satellites endure;<br/>And if to this exchange you should be given,<br/>I'll try to coax _our_ Cerberus up to Heaven!"<br/><br/>Here Michael interposed: "Good Saint! and Devil!<br/>  Pray, not so fast; you both outrun discretion.<br/>Saint Peter! you were wont to be more civil:<br/>  Satan! excuse this warmth of his expression,<br/>And condescension to the vulgar's level:<br/>  Even Saints sometimes forget themselves in session.<br/>Have you got more to say?"--"No."--"If you please,<br/>I'll trouble you to call your witnesses."<br/><br/>Then Satan turned and waved his swarthy hand,<br/>  Which stirred with its electric qualities<br/>Clouds farther off than we can understand,<br/>  Although we find him sometimes in our skies;<br/>Infernal thunder shook both sea and land<br/>  In all the planets--and Hell's batteries<br/>Let off the artillery, which Milton mentions<br/>As one of Satan's most sublime inventions.<br/><br/>This was a signal unto such damned souls<br/>  As have the privilege of their damnation<br/>Extended far beyond the mere controls<br/>  Of worlds past, present, or to come; no station<br/>Is theirs particularly in the rolls<br/>  Of Hell assigned; but where their inclination<br/>Or business carries them in search of game,<br/>They may range freely--being damned the same.<br/><br/>They are proud of this--as very well they may,<br/>  It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key<br/>Stuck in their loins; or like to an "entr√©"<br/>  Up the back stairs, or such free-masonry.<br/>I borrow my comparisons from clay,<br/>  Being clay myself. Let not those spirits be<br/>Offended with such base low likenesses;<br/>We know their posts are nobler far than these.<br/><br/>When the great signal ran from Heaven to Hell--<br/>  About ten million times the distance reckoned<br/>From our sun to its earth, as we can tell<br/>  How much time it takes up, even to a second,<br/>For every ray that travels to dispel<br/>  The fogs of London, through which, dimly beaconed,<br/>The weathercocks are gilt some thrice a year,<br/>If that the _summer_ is not too severe:<br/><br/>I say that I can tell--'twas half a minute;<br/>  I know the solar beams take up more time<br/>Ere, packed up for their journey, they begin it;<br/>  But then their Telegraph is less sublime,<br/>And if they ran a race, they would not win it<br/>  'Gainst Satan's couriers bound for their own clime.<br/>The sun takes up some years for every ray<br/>To reach its goal--the Devil not half a day.<br/><br/>Upon the verge of space, about the size<br/>  Of half-a-crown, a little speck appeared<br/>(I've seen a something like it in the skies<br/>  In the √Ügean, ere a squall); it neared,<br/>And, growing bigger, took another guise;<br/>  Like an a√´rial ship it tacked, and steered,<br/>Or _was_ steered (I am doubtful of the grammar<br/>Of the last phrase, which makes the stanza stammer;<br/><br/>But take your choice): and then it grew a cloud;<br/>  And so it was--a cloud of witnesses.<br/>But such a cloud! No land ere saw a crowd<br/>  Of locusts numerous as the heavens saw these;<br/>They shadowed with their myriads Space; their loud<br/>  And varied cries were like those of wild geese,<br/>(If nations may be likened to a goose),<br/>And realised the phrase of "Hell broke loose."<br/><br/>Here crashed a sturdy oath of stout John Bull,<br/>  Who damned away his eyes as heretofore:<br/>There Paddy brogued "By Jasus!"--"What's your wull?"<br/>  The temperate Scot exclaimed: the French ghost swore<br/>In certain terms I shan't translate in full,<br/>  As the first coachman will; and 'midst the war,<br/>The voice of Jonathan was heard to express,<br/>"_Our_ President is going to war, I guess."<br/><br/>Besides there were the Spaniard, Dutch, and Dane;<br/>  In short, an universal shoal of shades<br/>From Otaheite's isle to Salisbury Plain,<br/>  Of all climes and professions, years and trades,<br/>Ready to swear against the good king's reign,<br/>  Bitter as clubs in cards are against spades:<br/>All summoned by this grand "subpoena," to<br/>Try if kings mayn't be damned like me or you.<br/><br/>When Michael saw this host, he first grew pale,<br/>  As Angels can; next, like Italian twilight,<br/>He turned all colours--as a peacock's tail,<br/>  Or sunset streaming through a Gothic skylight<br/>In some old abbey, or a trout not stale,<br/>  Or distant lightning on the horizon by night,<br/>Or a fresh rainbow, or a grand review<br/>Of thirty regiments in red, green, and blue.<br/><br/>Then he addressed himself to Satan: "Why--<br/>  My good old friend, for such I deem you, though<br/>Our different parties make us fight so shy,<br/>  I ne'er mistake you for a _personal_ foe;<br/>Our difference _political_, and I<br/>  Trust that, whatever may occur below,<br/>You know my great respect for you: and this<br/>Makes me regret whate'er you do amiss--<br/><br/>"Why, my dear Lucifer, would you abuse<br/>  My call for witnesses? I did not mean<br/>That you should half of Earth and Hell produce;<br/>  'Tis even superfluous, since two honest, clean,<br/>True testimonies are enough: we lose<br/>  Our Time, nay, our Eternity, between<br/>The accusation and defence: if we<br/>Hear both, 'twill stretch our immortality."<br/><br/>Satan replied, "To me the matter is<br/>  Indifferent, in a personal point of view:<br/>I can have fifty better souls than this<br/>  With far less trouble than we have gone through<br/>Already; and I merely argued his<br/>  Late Majesty of Britain's case with you<br/>Upon a point of form: you may dispose<br/>Of him; I've kings enough below, God knows!"<br/><br/>Thus spoke the Demon (late called "multifaced"<br/>  By multo-scribbling Southey). "Then we'll call<br/>One or two persons of the myriads placed<br/>  Around our congress, and dispense with all<br/>The rest," quoth Michael: "Who may be so graced<br/>  As to speak first? there's choice enough--who shall<br/>It be?" Then Satan answered, "There are many;<br/>But you may choose Jack Wilkes as well as any."<br/><br/>A merry, cock-eyed, curious-looking Sprite<br/>  Upon the instant started from the throng,<br/>Dressed in a fashion now forgotten quite;<br/>  For all the fashions of the flesh stick long<br/>By people in the next world; where unite<br/>  All the costumes since Adam's, right or wrong,<br/>From Eve's fig-leaf down to the petticoat,<br/>Almost as scanty, of days less remote.<br/><br/>The Spirit looked around upon the crowds<br/>  Assembled, and exclaimed, "My friends of all<br/>The spheres, we shall catch cold amongst these clouds;<br/>  So let's to business: why this general call?<br/>If those are freeholders I see in shrouds,<br/>  And 'tis for an election that they bawl,<br/>Behold a candidate with unturned coat!<br/>Saint Peter, may I count upon your vote?"<br/><br/>"Sir," replied Michael, "you mistake; these things<br/>  Are of a former life, and what we do<br/>Above is more august; to judge of kings<br/>  Is the tribunal met: so now you know."<br/>"Then I presume those gentlemen with wings,"<br/>  Said Wilkes, "are Cherubs; and that soul below<br/>Looks much like George the Third, but to my mind<br/>A good deal older--bless me! is he blind?"<br/><br/>"He is what you behold him, and his doom<br/>  Depends upon his deeds," the Angel said;<br/>"If you have aught to arraign in him, the tomb<br/>  Gives license to the humblest beggar's head<br/>To lift itself against the loftiest."--"Some,"<br/>  Said Wilkes, "don't wait to see them laid in lead,<br/>For such a liberty--and I, for one,<br/>Have told them what I thought beneath the sun."<br/><br/>"_Above_ the sun repeat, then, what thou hast<br/>  To urge against him," said the Archangel. "Why,"<br/>Replied the spirit, "since old scores are past,<br/>  Must I turn evidence? In faith, not I.<br/>Besides, I beat him hollow at the last,<br/>  With all his Lords and Commons: in the sky<br/>I don't like ripping up old stories, since<br/>His conduct was but natural in a prince.<br/><br/>"Foolish, no doubt, and wicked, to oppress<br/>  A poor unlucky devil without a shilling;<br/>But then I blame the man himself much less<br/>  Than Bute and Grafton, and shall be unwilling<br/>To see him punished here for their excess,<br/>  Since they were both damned long ago, and still in<br/>Their place below: for me, I have forgiven,<br/>And vote his _habeas corpus_ into Heaven."<br/><br/>"Wilkes," said the Devil, "I understand all this;<br/>  You turned to half a courtier ere you died,<br/>And seem to think it would not be amiss<br/>  To grow a whole one on the other side<br/>Of Charon's ferry; you forget that _his_<br/>  Reign is concluded; whatsoe'er betide,<br/>He won't be sovereign more: you've lost your labour,<br/>For at the best he will but be your neighbour.<br/><br/>"However, I knew what to think of it,<br/>  When I beheld you in your jesting way,<br/>Flitting and whispering round about the spit<br/>  Where Belial, upon duty for the day,<br/>With Fox's lard was basting William Pitt,<br/>  His pupil; I knew what to think, I say:<br/>That fellow even in Hell breeds farther ills;<br/>I'll have him _gagged_--'twas one of his own Bills.<br/><br/>"Call Junius!" From the crowd a shadow stalked.<br/>  And at the name there was a general squeeze,<br/>So that the very ghosts no longer walked<br/>  In comfort, at their own a√´rial ease,<br/>But were all rammed, and jammed (but to be balked,<br/>  As we shall see), and jostled hands and knees,<br/>Like wind compressed and pent within a bladder,<br/>Or like a human colic, which is sadder.<br/><br/>The shadow came--a tall, thin, grey-haired figure,<br/>  That looked as it had been a shade on earth;<br/>Quick in its motions, with an air of vigour,<br/>  But nought to mark its breeding or its birth;<br/>Now it waxed little, then again grew bigger,<br/>  With now an air of gloom, or savage mirth:<br/>But as you gazed upon its features, they<br/>Changed every instant--to _what_, none could say.<br/><br/>The more intently the ghosts gazed, the less<br/>  Could they distinguish whose the features were;<br/>The Devil himself seemed puzzled even to guess;<br/>  They varied like a dream--now here, now there;<br/>And several people swore from out the press,<br/>  They knew him perfectly; and one could swear<br/>He was his father; upon which another<br/>Was sure he was his mother's cousin's brother:<br/><br/>Another, that he was a duke, or knight,<br/>  An orator, a lawyer, or a priest,<br/>A nabob, a man-midwife; but the wight<br/>  Mysterious changed his countenance at least<br/>As oft as they their minds: though in full sight<br/>  He stood, the puzzle only was increased;<br/>The man was a phantasmagoria in<br/>Himself--he was so volatile and thin.<br/><br/>The moment that you had pronounced him _one_,<br/>  Presto! his face changed, and he was another;<br/>And when that change was hardly well put on,<br/>  It varied, till I don't think his own mother<br/>(If that he had a mother) would her son<br/>  Have known, he shifted so from one to t'other;<br/>Till guessing from a pleasure grew a task,<br/>At this epistolary "Iron Mask."<br/><br/>For sometimes he like Cerberus would seem--<br/>  "Three gentlemen at once" (as sagely says<br/>Good Mrs. Malaprop); then you might deem<br/>  That he was not even _one_; now many rays<br/>Were flashing round him; and now a thick steam<br/>  Hid him from sight--like fogs on London days:<br/>Now Burke, now Tooke, he grew to people's fancies<br/>And certes often like Sir Philip Francis.<br/><br/>I've an hypothesis--'tis quite my own;<br/>  I never let it out till now, for fear<br/>Of doing people harm about the throne,<br/>  And injuring some minister or peer,<br/>On whom the stigma might perhaps be blown;<br/>  It is--my gentle public, lend thine ear!<br/>'Tis, that what Junius we are wont to call,<br/>Was _really--truly_--nobody at all.<br/><br/>I don't see wherefore letters should not be<br/>  Written without hands, since we daily view<br/>Them written without heads; and books, we see,<br/>  Are filled as well without the latter too:<br/>And really till we fix on somebody<br/>  For certain sure to claim them as his due,<br/>Their author, like the Niger's mouth, will bother<br/>The world to say if _there_ be mouth or author.<br/><br/>"And who and what art thou?" the Archangel said.<br/>  "For _that_ you may consult my title-page,"<br/>Replied this mighty shadow of a shade:<br/>  "If I have kept my secret half an age,<br/>I scarce shall tell it now."--"Canst thou upbraid,"<br/>  Continued Michael, "George Rex, or allege<br/>Aught further?" Junius answered, "You had better<br/>First ask him for _his_ answer to my letter:<br/><br/>"My charges upon record will outlast<br/>  The brass of both his epitaph and tomb."<br/>"Repent'st thou not," said Michael, "of some past<br/>  Exaggeration? something which may doom<br/>Thyself if false, as him if true? Thou wast<br/>  Too bitter--is it not so?--in thy gloom<br/>Of passion?"--"Passion!" cried the phantom dim,<br/>"I loved my country, and I hated him.<br/><br/>"What I have written, I have written: let<br/>  The rest be on his head or mine!" So spoke<br/>Old "_Nominis Umbra_;" and while speaking yet,<br/>  Away he melted in celestial smoke.<br/>Then Satan said to Michael, "Don't forget<br/>  To call George Washington, and John Horne Tooke,<br/>And Franklin;"--but at this time there was heard<br/>A cry for room, though not a phantom stirred.<br/><br/>At length with jostling, elbowing, and the aid<br/>  Of Cherubim appointed to that post,<br/>The devil Asmodeus to the circle made<br/>  His way, and looked as if his journey cost<br/>Some trouble. When his burden down he laid,<br/>  "What's this?" cried Michael; "why, 'tis not a ghost?"<br/>"I know it," quoth the Incubus; "but he<br/>Shall be one, if you leave the affair to me.<br/><br/>"Confound the renegado! I have sprained<br/>  My left wing, he's so heavy; one would think<br/>Some of his works about his neck were chained.<br/>  But to the point; while hovering o'er the brink<br/>Of Skiddaw (where as usual it still rained),<br/>  I saw a taper, far below me, wink,<br/>And stooping, caught this fellow at a libel--<br/>No less on History--than the Holy Bible.<br/><br/>"The former is the Devil's scripture, and<br/>  The latter yours, good Michael: so the affair<br/>Belongs to all of us, you understand.<br/>  I snatched him up just as you see him there,<br/>And brought him off for sentence out of hand:<br/>  I've scarcely been ten minutes in the air--<br/>At least a quarter it can hardly be:<br/>I dare say that his wife is still at tea."<br/><br/>Here Satan said, "I know this man of old,<br/>  And have expected him for some time here;<br/>A sillier fellow you will scarce behold,<br/>  Or more conceited in his petty sphere:<br/>But surely it was not worth while to fold<br/>  Such trash below your wing, Asmodeus dear:<br/>We had the poor wretch safe (without being bored<br/>With carriage) coming of his own accord.<br/><br/>"But since he's here, let's see what he has done."<br/>  "Done!" cried Asmodeus, "he anticipates<br/>The very business you are now upon,<br/>  And scribbles as if head clerk to the Fates.<br/>Who knows to what his ribaldry may run,<br/>  When such an ass as this, like Balaam's, prates?"<br/>"Let's hear," quoth Michael, "what he has to say:<br/>You know we're bound to that in every way."<br/><br/>Now the bard, glad to get an audience, which<br/>  By no means often was his case below,<br/>Began to cough, and hawk, and hem, and pitch<br/>  His voice into that awful note of woe<br/>To all unhappy hearers within reach<br/>  Of poets when the tide of rhyme's in flow;<br/>But stuck fast with his first hexameter,<br/>Not one of all whose gouty feet would stir.<br/><br/>But ere the spavined dactyls could be spurred<br/>  Into recitative, in great dismay<br/>Both Cherubim and Seraphim were heard<br/>  To murmur loudly through their long array;<br/>And Michael rose ere he could get a word<br/>  Of all his foundered verses under way,<br/>And cried, "For God's sake stop, my friend! 'twere best--<br/>'_Non Di, non homines_'--you know the rest."<br/><br/>A general bustle spread throughout the throng,<br/>  Which seemed to hold all verse in detestation;<br/>The Angels had of course enough of song<br/>  When upon service; and the generation<br/>Of ghosts had heard too much in life, not long<br/>  Before, to profit by a new occasion:<br/>The Monarch, mute till then, exclaimed, "What! what!<br/>_Pye_ come again? No more--no more of that!"<br/><br/>The tumult grew; an universal cough<br/>  Convulsed the skies, as during a debate,<br/>When Castlereagh has been up long enough<br/>  (Before he was first minister of state,<br/>I mean--the _slaves hear now_); some cried "Off, off!"<br/>  As at a farce; till, grown quite desperate,<br/>The Bard Saint Peter prayed to interpose<br/>(Himself an author) only for his prose.<br/><br/>The varlet was not an ill-favoured knave;<br/>  A good deal like a vulture in the face,<br/>With a hook nose and a hawk's eye, which gave<br/>  A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace<br/>To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave,<br/>  Was by no means so ugly as his case;<br/>But that, indeed, was hopeless as can be,<br/>Quite a poetic felony "_de se_."<br/><br/>Then Michael blew his trump, and stilled the noise<br/>  With one still greater, as is yet the mode<br/>On earth besides; except some grumbling voice,<br/>  Which now and then will make a slight inroad<br/>Upon decorous silence, few will twice<br/>  Lift up their lungs when fairly overcrowed;<br/>And now the Bard could plead his own bad cause,<br/>With all the attitudes of self-applause.<br/><br/>He said--(I only give the heads)--he said,<br/>  He meant no harm in scribbling; 'twas his way<br/>Upon all topics; 'twas, besides, his bread,<br/>  Of which he buttered both sides; 'twould delay<br/>Too long the assembly (he was pleased to dread),<br/>  And take up rather more time than a day,<br/>To name his works--he would but cite a few--<br/>"Wat Tyler"--"Rhymes on Blenheim"--"Waterloo."<br/><br/>He had written praises of a Regicide;<br/>  He had written praises of all kings whatever;<br/>He had written for republics far and wide,<br/>  And then against them bitterer than ever;<br/>For pantisocracy he once had cried<br/>  Aloud, a scheme less moral than 'twas clever;<br/>Then grew a hearty anti-jacobin--<br/>Had turned his coat--and would have turned his skin.<br/><br/>He had sung against all battles, and again<br/>  In their high praise and glory; he had called<br/>Reviewing "the ungentle craft," and then<br/>  Became as base a critic as e'er crawled--<br/>Fed, paid, and pampered by the very men<br/>  By whom his muse and morals had been mauled:<br/>He had written much blank verse, and blanker prose,<br/>And more of both than any body knows.<br/><br/>He had written Wesley's life:--here turning round<br/>  To Satan, "Sir, I'm ready to write yours,<br/>In two octavo volumes, nicely bound,<br/>  With notes and preface, all that most allures<br/>The pious purchaser; and there's no ground<br/>  For fear, for I can choose my own reviewers:<br/>So let me have the proper documents,<br/>That I may add you to my other saints."<br/><br/>Satan bowed, and was silent. "Well, if you,<br/>  With amiable modesty, decline<br/>My offer, what says Michael? There are few<br/>  Whose memoirs could be rendered more divine.<br/>Mine is a pen of all work; not so new<br/>  As it was once, but I would make you shine<br/>Like your own trumpet. By the way, my own<br/>Has more of brass in it, and is as well blown.<br/><br/>"But talking about trumpets, here's my 'Vision!'<br/>  Now you shall judge, all people--yes--you shall<br/>Judge with my judgment! and by my decision<br/>  Be guided who shall enter heaven or fall.<br/>I settle all these things by intuition,<br/>  Times present, past, to come--Heaven--Hell--and all,<br/>Like King Alfonso. When I thus see double,<br/>I save the Deity some worlds of trouble."<br/><br/>He ceased, and drew forth an MS.; and no<br/>  Persuasion on the part of Devils, Saints,<br/>Or Angels, now could stop the torrent; so<br/>  He read the first three lines of the contents:<br/>But at the fourth, the whole spiritual show<br/>Had vanished, with variety of scents,<br/>Ambrosial and sulphureous, as they sprang,<br/>Like lightning, off from his "melodious twang."<br/><br/>Those grand heroics acted as a spell;<br/>  The Angels stopped their ears and plied their pinions;<br/>The Devils ran howling, deafened, down to Hell;<br/>  The ghosts fled, gibbering, for their own dominions--<br/>(For 'tis not yet decided where they dwell,<br/>  And I leave every man to his opinions);<br/>Michael took refuge in his trump--but, lo!<br/>His teeth were set on edge, he could not blow!<br/><br/>Saint Peter, who has hitherto been known<br/>  For an impetuous saint, upraised his keys,<br/>And at the fifth line knocked the poet down;<br/>  Who fell like Phaeton, but more at ease,<br/>Into his lake, for there he did not drown;<br/>  A different web being by the Destinies<br/>Woven for the Laureate's final wreath, whene'er<br/>Reform shall happen either here or there.<br/><br/>He first sank to the bottom--like his works,<br/>  But soon rose to the surface--like himself;<br/>For all corrupted things are buoyed like corks,<br/>  By their own rottenness, light as an elf,<br/>Or wisp that flits o'er a morass: he lurks,<br/>  It may be, still, like dull books on a shelf,<br/>In his own den, to scrawl some "Life" or "Vision,"<br/>As Welborn says--"the Devil turned precisian."<br/><br/>As for the rest, to come to the conclusion<br/>  Of this true dream, the telescope is gone<br/>Which kept my optics free from all delusion,<br/>  And showed me what I in my turn have shown;<br/>All I saw farther, in the last confusion,<br/>  Was, that King George slipped into Heaven for one;<br/>And when the tumult dwindled to a calm,<br/>I left him practising the hundredth psalm.
