# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 08 by *John Milton*

<p>
    The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear<br/>So charming left his voice, that he a while<br/>Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;<br/>Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.<br/>What thanks sufficient, or what recompence<br/>Equal, have I to render thee, divine<br/>Historian, who thus largely hast allayed<br/>The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed<br/>This friendly condescension to relate<br/>Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard<br/>With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,<br/>With glory attributed to the high<br/>Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains,<br/>Which only thy solution can resolve.<br/>When I behold this goodly frame, this world,<br/>Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute<br/>Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,<br/>An atom, with the firmament compared<br/>And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll<br/>Spaces incomprehensible, (for such<br/>Their distance argues, and their swift return<br/>Diurnal,) merely to officiate light<br/>Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,<br/>One day and night; in all her vast survey<br/>Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,<br/>How Nature wise and frugal could commit<br/>Such disproportions, with superfluous hand<br/>So many nobler bodies to create,<br/>Greater so manifold, to this one use,<br/>For aught appears, and on their orbs impose<br/>Such restless revolution day by day<br/>Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,<br/>That better might with far less compass move,<br/>Served by more noble than herself, attains<br/>Her end without least motion, and receives,<br/>As tribute, such a sumless journey brought<br/>Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;<br/>Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.<br/>So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed<br/>Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve<br/>Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,<br/>With lowliness majestick from her seat,<br/>And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,<br/>Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,<br/>To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,<br/>Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,<br/>And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.<br/>Yet went she not, as not with such discourse<br/>Delighted, or not capable her ear<br/>Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,<br/>Adam relating, she sole auditress;<br/>Her husband the relater she preferred<br/>Before the Angel, and of him to ask<br/>Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix<br/>Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute<br/>With conjugal caresses: from his lip<br/>Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now<br/>Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?<br/>With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,<br/>Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,<br/>A pomp of winning Graces waited still,<br/>And from about her shot darts of desire<br/>Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.<br/>And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed,<br/>Benevolent and facile thus replied.<br/>To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven<br/>Is as the book of God before thee set,<br/>Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn<br/>His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:<br/>This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,<br/>Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest<br/>From Man or Angel the great Architect<br/>Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br/>His secrets to be scanned by them who ought<br/>Rather admire; or, if they list to try<br/>Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens<br/>Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move<br/>His laughter at their quaint opinions wide<br/>Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven<br/>And calculate the stars, how they will wield<br/>The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive<br/>To save appearances; how gird the sphere<br/>With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er,<br/>Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:<br/>Already by thy reasoning this I guess,<br/>Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest<br/>That bodies bright and greater should not serve<br/>The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,<br/>Earth sitting still, when she alone receives<br/>The benefit:  Consider first, that great<br/>Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth<br/>Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,<br/>Nor glistering, may of solid good contain<br/>More plenty than the sun that barren shines;<br/>Whose virtue on itself works no effect,<br/>But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,<br/>His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.<br/>Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries<br/>Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant.<br/>And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak<br/>The Maker's high magnificence, who built<br/>So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;<br/>That Man may know he dwells not in his own;<br/>An edifice too large for him to fill,<br/>Lodged in a small partition; and the rest<br/>Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.<br/>The swiftness of those circles attribute,<br/>Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,<br/>That to corporeal substances could add<br/>Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow,<br/>Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven<br/>Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived<br/>In Eden; distance inexpressible<br/>By numbers that have name.  But this I urge,<br/>Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show<br/>Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;<br/>Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br/>To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br/>God, to remove his ways from human sense,<br/>Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,<br/>If it presume, might err in things too high,<br/>And no advantage gain.  What if the sun<br/>Be center to the world; and other stars,<br/>By his attractive virtue and their own<br/>Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br/>Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,<br/>Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br/>In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these<br/>The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,<br/>Insensibly three different motions move?<br/>Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,<br/>Moved contrary with thwart obliquities;<br/>Or save the sun his labour, and that swift<br/>Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,<br/>Invisible else above all stars, the wheel<br/>Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,<br/>If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day<br/>Travelling east, and with her part averse<br/>From the sun's beam meet night, her other part<br/>Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light,<br/>Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,<br/>To the terrestrial moon be as a star,<br/>Enlightening her by day, as she by night<br/>This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,<br/>Fields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest<br/>As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce<br/>Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat<br/>Allotted there; and other suns perhaps,<br/>With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,<br/>Communicating male and female light;<br/>Which two great sexes animate the world,<br/>Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.<br/>For such vast room in Nature unpossessed<br/>By living soul, desart and desolate,<br/>Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute<br/>Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far<br/>Down to this habitable, which returns<br/>Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.<br/>But whether thus these things, or whether not;<br/>But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,<br/>Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;<br/>He from the east his flaming road begin;<br/>Or she from west her silent course advance,<br/>With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps<br/>On her soft axle, while she paces even,<br/>And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along;<br/>Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;<br/>Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!<br/>Of other creatures, as him pleases best,<br/>Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou<br/>In what he gives to thee, this Paradise<br/>And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high<br/>To know what passes there; be lowly wise:<br/>Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;<br/>Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there<br/>Live, in what state, condition, or degree;<br/>Contented that thus far hath been revealed<br/>Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.<br/>To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.<br/>How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure<br/>Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!<br/>And, freed from intricacies, taught to live<br/>The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts<br/>To interrupt the sweet of life, from which<br/>God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,<br/>And not molest us; unless we ourselves<br/>Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.<br/>But apt the mind or fancy is to rove<br/>Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;<br/>Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,<br/>That, not to know at large of things remote<br/>From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know<br/>That which before us lies in daily life,<br/>Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume,<br/>Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:<br/>And renders us, in things that most concern,<br/>Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.<br/>Therefore from this high pitch let us descend<br/>A lower flight, and speak of things at hand<br/>Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise<br/>Of something not unseasonable to ask,<br/>By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.<br/>Thee I have heard relating what was done<br/>Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate<br/>My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;<br/>And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest<br/>How subtly to detain thee I devise;<br/>Inviting thee to hear while I relate;<br/>Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:<br/>For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;<br/>And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear<br/>Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst<br/>And hunger both, from labour, at the hour<br/>Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,<br/>Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine<br/>Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.<br/>To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.<br/>Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,<br/>Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee<br/>Abundantly his gifts hath also poured<br/>Inward and outward both, his image fair:<br/>Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace<br/>Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;<br/>Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth<br/>Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire<br/>Gladly into the ways of God with Man:<br/>For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set<br/>On Man his equal love:  Say therefore on;<br/>For I that day was absent, as befel,<br/>Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,<br/>Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;<br/>Squared in full legion (such command we had)<br/>To see that none thence issued forth a spy,<br/>Or enemy, while God was in his work;<br/>Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,<br/>Destruction with creation might have mixed.<br/>Not that they durst without his leave attempt;<br/>But us he sends upon his high behests<br/>For state, as Sovran King; and to inure<br/>Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut,<br/>The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;<br/>But long ere our approaching heard within<br/>Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,<br/>Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.<br/>Glad we returned up to the coasts of light<br/>Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.<br/>But thy relation now; for I attend,<br/>Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.<br/>So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.<br/>For Man to tell how human life began<br/>Is hard; for who himself beginning knew<br/>Desire with thee still longer to converse<br/>Induced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep,<br/>Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,<br/>In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun<br/>Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.<br/>Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,<br/>And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised<br/>By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,<br/>As thitherward endeavouring, and upright<br/>Stood on my feet: about me round I saw<br/>Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,<br/>And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,<br/>Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;<br/>Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;<br/>With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.<br/>Myself I then perused, and limb by limb<br/>Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran<br/>With supple joints, as lively vigour led:<br/>But who I was, or where, or from what cause,<br/>Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;<br/>My tongue obeyed, and readily could name<br/>Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light,<br/>And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,<br/>Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,<br/>And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,<br/>Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?--<br/>Not of myself;--by some great Maker then,<br/>In goodness and in power pre-eminent:<br/>Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,<br/>From whom I have that thus I move and live,<br/>And feel that I am happier than I know.--<br/>While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,<br/>From where I first drew air, and first beheld<br/>This happy light; when, answer none returned,<br/>On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,<br/>Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep<br/>First found me, and with soft oppression seised<br/>My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought<br/>I then was passing to my former state<br/>Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:<br/>When suddenly stood at my head a dream,<br/>Whose inward apparition gently moved<br/>My fancy to believe I yet had being,<br/>And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine,<br/>And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,<br/>'First Man, of men innumerable ordained<br/>'First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide<br/>'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.'<br/>So saying, by the hand he took me raised,<br/>And over fields and waters, as in air<br/>Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up<br/>A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,<br/>A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees<br/>Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw<br/>Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree,<br/>Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye<br/>Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite<br/>To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found<br/>Before mine eyes all real, as the dream<br/>Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun<br/>My wandering, had not he, who was my guide<br/>Up hither, from among the trees appeared,<br/>Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe,<br/>In adoration at his feet I fell<br/>Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,'<br/>Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest<br/>'Above, or round about thee, or beneath.<br/>'This Paradise I give thee, count it thine<br/>'To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:<br/>'Of every tree that in the garden grows<br/>'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:<br/>'But of the tree whose operation brings<br/>'Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set<br/>'The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,<br/>'Amid the garden by the tree of life,<br/>'Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,<br/>'And shun the bitter consequence: for know,<br/>'The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command<br/>'Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,<br/>'From that day mortal; and this happy state<br/>'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world<br/>'Of woe and sorrow.'  Sternly he pronounced<br/>The rigid interdiction, which resounds<br/>Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice<br/>Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect<br/>Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.<br/>'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth<br/>'To thee and to thy race I give; as lords<br/>'Possess it, and all things that therein live,<br/>'Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.<br/>'In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold<br/>'After their kinds; I bring them to receive<br/>'From thee their names, and pay thee fealty<br/>'With low subjection; understand the same<br/>'Of fish within their watery residence,<br/>'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change<br/>'Their element, to draw the thinner air.'<br/>As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold<br/>Approaching two and two; these cowering low<br/>With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.<br/>I named them, as they passed, and understood<br/>Their nature, with such knowledge God endued<br/>My sudden apprehension:  But in these<br/>I found not what methought I wanted still;<br/>And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.<br/>O, by what name, for thou above all these,<br/>Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,<br/>Surpassest far my naming; how may I<br/>Adore thee, Author of this universe,<br/>And all this good to man? for whose well being<br/>So amply, and with hands so liberal,<br/>Thou hast provided all things:  But with me<br/>I see not who partakes.  In solitude<br/>What happiness, who can enjoy alone,<br/>Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?<br/>Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,<br/>As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.<br/>What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth<br/>With various living creatures, and the air<br/>Replenished, and all these at thy command<br/>To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not<br/>Their language and their ways?  They also know,<br/>And reason not contemptibly:  With these<br/>Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.<br/>So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed<br/>So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored,<br/>And humble deprecation, thus replied.<br/>Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;<br/>My Maker, be propitious while I speak.<br/>Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,<br/>And these inferiour far beneath me set?<br/>Among unequals what society<br/>Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?<br/>Which must be mutual, in proportion due<br/>Given and received; but, in disparity<br/>The one intense, the other still remiss,<br/>Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove<br/>Tedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak<br/>Such as I seek, fit to participate<br/>All rational delight: wherein the brute<br/>Cannot be human consort:  They rejoice<br/>Each with their kind, lion with lioness;<br/>So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:<br/>Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl<br/>So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;<br/>Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.<br/>Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.<br/>A nice and subtle happiness, I see,<br/>Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice<br/>Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste<br/>No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.<br/>What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?<br/>Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed<br/>Of happiness, or not? who am alone<br/>From all eternity; for none I know<br/>Second to me or like, equal much less.<br/>How have I then with whom to hold converse,<br/>Save with the creatures which I made, and those<br/>To me inferiour, infinite descents<br/>Beneath what other creatures are to thee?<br/>He ceased; I lowly answered.  To attain<br/>The highth and depth of thy eternal ways<br/>All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!<br/>Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee<br/>Is no deficience found:  Not so is Man,<br/>But in degree; the cause of his desire<br/>By conversation with his like to help<br/>Or solace his defects.  No need that thou<br/>Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;<br/>And through all numbers absolute, though One:<br/>But Man by number is to manifest<br/>His single imperfection, and beget<br/>Like of his like, his image multiplied,<br/>In unity defective; which requires<br/>Collateral love, and dearest amity.<br/>Thou in thy secresy although alone,<br/>Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not<br/>Social communication; yet, so pleased,<br/>Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt<br/>Of union or communion, deified:<br/>I, by conversing, cannot these erect<br/>From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.<br/>Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used<br/>Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained<br/>This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.<br/>Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;<br/>And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,<br/>Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;<br/>Expressing well the spirit within thee free,<br/>My image, not imparted to the brute;<br/>Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee<br/>Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;<br/>And be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest,<br/>Knew it not good for Man to be alone;<br/>And no such company as then thou sawest<br/>Intended thee; for trial only brought,<br/>To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:<br/>What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,<br/>Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,<br/>Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.<br/>He ended, or I heard no more; for now<br/>My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,<br/>Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth<br/>In that celestial colloquy sublime,<br/>As with an object that excels the sense<br/>Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair<br/>Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called<br/>By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.<br/>Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell<br/>Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,<br/>Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,<br/>Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape<br/>Still glorious before whom awake I stood:<br/>Who stooping opened my left side, and took<br/>From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,<br/>And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,<br/>But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:<br/>The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;<br/>Under his forming hands a creature grew,<br/>Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,<br/>That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now<br/>Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained<br/>And in her looks; which from that time infused<br/>Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,<br/>And into all things from her air inspired<br/>The spirit of love and amorous delight.<br/>She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked<br/>To find her, or for ever to deplore<br/>Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:<br/>When out of hope, behold her, not far off,<br/>Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned<br/>With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow<br/>To make her amiable:  On she came,<br/>Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,<br/>And guided by his voice; nor uninformed<br/>Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:<br/>Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,<br/>In every gesture dignity and love.<br/>I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.<br/>This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled<br/>Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,<br/>Giver of all things fair! but fairest this<br/>Of all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see<br/>Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself<br/>Before me:  Woman is her name;of Man<br/>Extracted: for this cause he shall forego<br/>Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;<br/>And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.<br/>She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,<br/>Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,<br/>Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,<br/>That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,<br/>Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,<br/>The more desirable; or, to say all,<br/>Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,<br/>Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:<br/>I followed her; she what was honour knew,<br/>And with obsequious majesty approved<br/>My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower<br/>I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,<br/>And happy constellations, on that hour<br/>Shed their selectest influence; the Earth<br/>Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;<br/>Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs<br/>Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings<br/>Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,<br/>Disporting, till the amorous bird of night<br/>Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star<br/>On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.<br/>Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought<br/>My story to the sum of earthly bliss,<br/>Which I enjoy; and must confess to find<br/>In all things else delight indeed, but such<br/>As, used or not, works in the mind no change,<br/>Nor vehement desire; these delicacies<br/>I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,<br/>Walks, and the melody of birds: but here<br/>Far otherwise, transported I behold,<br/>Transported touch; here passion first I felt,<br/>Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else<br/>Superiour and unmoved; here only weak<br/>Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance.<br/>Or Nature failed in me, and left some part<br/>Not proof enough such object to sustain;<br/>Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps<br/>More than enough; at least on her bestowed<br/>Too much of ornament, in outward show<br/>Elaborate, of inward less exact.<br/>For well I understand in the prime end<br/>Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind<br/>And inward faculties, which most excel;<br/>In outward also her resembling less<br/>His image who made both, and less expressing<br/>The character of that dominion given<br/>O'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach<br/>Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br/>And in herself complete, so well to know<br/>Her own, that what she wills to do or say,<br/>Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:<br/>All higher knowledge in her presence falls<br/>Degraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her<br/>Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;<br/>Authority and Reason on her wait,<br/>As one intended first, not after made<br/>Occasionally; and, to consummate all,<br/>Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat<br/>Build in her loveliest, and create an awe<br/>About her, as a guard angelick placed.<br/>To whom the Angel with contracted brow.<br/>Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;<br/>Do thou but thine; and be not diffident<br/>Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou<br/>Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,<br/>By attributing overmuch to things<br/>Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.<br/>For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,<br/>An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well<br/>Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;<br/>Not thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself;<br/>Then value:  Oft-times nothing profits more<br/>Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br/>Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,<br/>The more she will acknowledge thee her head,<br/>And to realities yield all her shows:<br/>Made so adorn for thy delight the more,<br/>So awful, that with honour thou mayest love<br/>Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.<br/>But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind<br/>Is propagated, seem such dear delight<br/>Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed<br/>To cattle and each beast; which would not be<br/>To them made common and divulged, if aught<br/>Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue<br/>The soul of man, or passion in him move.<br/>What higher in her society thou findest<br/>Attractive, human, rational, love still;<br/>In loving thou dost well, in passion not,<br/>Wherein true love consists not:  Love refines<br/>The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat<br/>In reason, and is judicious; is the scale<br/>By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,<br/>Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,<br/>Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.<br/>To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.<br/>Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught<br/>In procreation common to all kinds,<br/>(Though higher of the genial bed by far,<br/>And with mysterious reverence I deem,)<br/>So much delights me, as those graceful acts,<br/>Those thousand decencies, that daily flow<br/>From all her words and actions mixed with love<br/>And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned<br/>Union of mind, or in us both one soul;<br/>Harmony to behold in wedded pair<br/>More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.<br/>Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose<br/>What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,<br/>Who meet with various objects, from the sense<br/>Variously representing; yet, still free,<br/>Approve the best, and follow what I approve.<br/>To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,<br/>Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;<br/>Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:<br/>Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love<br/>Express they? by looks only? or do they mix<br/>Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?<br/>To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed<br/>Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,<br/>Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest<br/>Us happy, and without love no happiness.<br/>Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,<br/>(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy<br/>In eminence; and obstacle find none<br/>Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;<br/>Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,<br/>Total they mix, union of pure with pure<br/>Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,<br/>As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.<br/>But I can now no more; the parting sun<br/>Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles<br/>Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.<br/>Be strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all,<br/>Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep<br/>His great command; take heed lest passion sway<br/>Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will<br/>Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,<br/>The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!<br/>I in thy persevering shall rejoice,<br/>And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall<br/>Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.<br/>Perfect within, no outward aid require;<br/>And all temptation to transgress repel.<br/>So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus<br/>Followed with benediction.  Since to part,<br/>Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,<br/>Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!<br/>Gentle to me and affable hath been<br/>Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever<br/>With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind<br/>Be good and friendly still, and oft return!<br/>So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven<br/>From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.
