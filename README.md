# üíÆ The Sensitive Plant by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    PART 1.<br/><br/>A Sensitive Plant in a garden grew,<br/>And the young winds fed it with silver dew,<br/>And it opened its fan-like leaves to the light.<br/>And closed them beneath the kisses of Night.<br/><br/>And the Spring arose on the garden fair,<br/>Like the Spirit of Love felt everywhere;<br/>And each flower and herb on Earth's dark breast<br/>Rose from the dreams of its wintry rest.<br/><br/>But none ever trembled and panted with bliss<br/>In the garden, the field, or the wilderness,<br/>Like a doe in the noontide with love's sweet want,<br/>As the companionless Sensitive Plant.<br/><br/>The snowdrop, and then the violet,<br/>Arose from the ground with warm rain wet,<br/>And their breath was mixed with fresh odour, sent<br/>From the turf, like the voice and the instrument.<br/><br/>Then the pied wind-flowers and the tulip tall,<br/>And narcissi, the fairest among them all,<br/>Who gaze on their eyes in the stream's recess,<br/>Till they die of their own dear loveliness;<br/><br/>And the Naiad-like lily of the vale,<br/>Whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale<br/>That the light of its tremulous bells is seen<br/>Through their pavilions of tender green;<br/><br/>And the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue,<br/>Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew<br/>Of music so delicate, soft, and intense,<br/>It was felt like an odour within the sense;<br/><br/>And the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed,<br/>Which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast,<br/>Till, fold after fold, to the fainting air<br/>The soul of her beauty and love lay bare:<br/><br/>And the wand-like lily, which lifted up,<br/>As a Maenad, its moonlight-coloured cup,<br/>Till the fiery star, which is its eye,<br/>Gazed through clear dew on the tender sky;<br/><br/>And the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose,<br/>The sweetest flower for scent that blows;<br/>And all rare blossoms from every clime<br/>Grew in that garden in perfect prime.<br/><br/>And on the stream whose inconstant bosom<br/>Was pranked, under boughs of embowering blossom,<br/>With golden and green light, slanting through<br/>Their heaven of many a tangled hue,<br/><br/>Broad water-lilies lay tremulously,<br/>And starry river-buds glimmered by,<br/>And around them the soft stream did glide and dance<br/>With a motion of sweet sound and radiance.<br/><br/>And the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss,<br/>Which led through the garden along and across,<br/>Some open at once to the sun and the breeze,<br/>Some lost among bowers of blossoming trees,<br/><br/>Were all paved with daisies and delicate bells<br/>As fair as the fabulous asphodels,<br/>And flow'rets which, drooping as day drooped too,<br/>Fell into pavilions, white, purple, and blue,<br/>To roof the glow-worm from the evening dew.<br/><br/>And from this undefiled Paradise<br/>The flowers (as an infant's awakening eyes<br/>Smile on its mother, whose singing sweet<br/>Can first lull, and at last must awaken it),<br/><br/>When Heaven's blithe winds had unfolded them,<br/>As mine-lamps enkindle a hidden gem,<br/>Shone smiling to Heaven, and every one<br/>Shared joy in the light of the gentle sun;<br/><br/>For each one was interpenetrated<br/>With the light and the odour its neighbour shed,<br/>Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear<br/>Wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere.<br/><br/>But the Sensitive Plant which could give small fruit<br/>Of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root,<br/>Received more than all, it loved more than ever,<br/>Where none wanted but it, could belong to the giver,--<br/><br/>For the Sensitive Plant has no bright flower;<br/>Radiance and odour are not its dower;<br/>It loves, even like Love, its deep heart is full,<br/>It desires what it has not, the Beautiful!<br/><br/>The light winds which from unsustaining wings<br/>Shed the music of many murmurings;<br/>The beams which dart from many a star<br/>Of the flowers whose hues they bear afar;<br/><br/>The plumed insects swift and free,<br/>Like golden boats on a sunny sea,<br/>Laden with light and odour, which pass<br/>Over the gleam of the living grass;<br/><br/>The unseen clouds of the dew, which lie<br/>Like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high,<br/>Then wander like spirits among the spheres,<br/>Each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears;<br/><br/>The quivering vapours of dim noontide,<br/>Which like a sea o'er the warm earth glide,<br/>In which every sound, and odour, and beam,<br/>Move, as reeds in a single stream;<br/><br/>Each and all like ministering angels were<br/>For the Sensitive Plant sweet joy to bear,<br/>Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by<br/>Like windless clouds o'er a tender sky.<br/><br/>And when evening descended from Heaven above,<br/>And the Earth was all rest, and the air was all love,<br/>And delight, though less bright, was far more deep,<br/>And the day's veil fell from the world of sleep,<br/><br/>And the beasts, and the birds, and the insects were drowned<br/>In an ocean of dreams without a sound;<br/>Whose waves never mark, though they ever impress<br/>The light sand which paves it, consciousness;<br/><br/>(Only overhead the sweet nightingale<br/>Ever sang more sweet as the day might fail,<br/>And snatches of its Elysian chant<br/>Were mixed with the dreams of the Sensitive Plant);--<br/><br/>The Sensitive Plant was the earliest<br/>Upgathered into the bosom of rest;<br/>A sweet child weary of its delight,<br/>The feeblest and yet the favourite,<br/>Cradled within the embrace of Night.<br/><br/>PART 2.<br/><br/>There was a Power in this sweet place,<br/>An Eve in this Eden; a ruling Grace<br/>Which to the flowers, did they waken or dream,<br/>Was as God is to the starry scheme.<br/><br/>A Lady, the wonder of her kind,<br/>Whose form was upborne by a lovely mind<br/>Which, dilating, had moulded her mien and motion<br/>Like a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean,<br/><br/>Tended the garden from morn to even:<br/>And the meteors of that sublunar Heaven,<br/>Like the lamps of the air when Night walks forth,<br/>Laughed round her footsteps up from the Earth!<br/><br/>She had no companion of mortal race,<br/>But her tremulous breath and her flushing face<br/>Told, whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes,<br/>That her dreams were less slumber than Paradise:<br/><br/>As if some bright Spirit for her sweet sake<br/>Had deserted Heaven while the stars were awake,<br/>As if yet around her he lingering were,<br/>Though the veil of daylight concealed him from her.<br/><br/>Her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed;<br/>You might hear by the heaving of her breast,<br/>That the coming and going of the wind<br/>Brought pleasure there and left passion behind.<br/><br/>And wherever her aery footstep trod,<br/>Her trailing hair from the grassy sod<br/>Erased its light vestige, with shadowy sweep,<br/>Like a sunny storm o'er the dark green deep.<br/><br/>I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet<br/>Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;<br/>I doubt not they felt the spirit that came<br/>From her glowing fingers through all their frame.<br/><br/>She sprinkled bright water from the stream<br/>On those that were faint with the sunny beam;<br/>And out of the cups of the heavy flowers<br/>She emptied the rain of the thunder-showers.<br/><br/>She lifted their heads with her tender hands,<br/>And sustained them with rods and osier-bands;<br/>If the flowers had been her own infants, she<br/>Could never have nursed them more tenderly.<br/><br/>And all killing insects and gnawing worms,<br/>And things of obscene and unlovely forms,<br/>She bore, in a basket of Indian woof,<br/>Into the rough woods far aloof,--<br/><br/>In a basket, of grasses and wild-flowers full,<br/>The freshest her gentle hands could pull<br/>For the poor banished insects, whose intent,<br/>Although they did ill, was innocent.<br/><br/>But the bee and the beamlike ephemeris<br/>Whose path is the lightning's, and soft moths that kiss<br/>The sweet lips of the flowers, and harm not, did she<br/>Make her attendant angels be.<br/><br/>And many an antenatal tomb,<br/>Where butterflies dream of the life to come,<br/>She left clinging round the smooth and dark<br/>Edge of the odorous cedar bark.<br/><br/>This fairest creature from earliest Spring<br/>Thus moved through the garden ministering<br/>Mi the sweet season of Summertide,<br/>And ere the first leaf looked brown--she died!<br/><br/>PART 3.<br/><br/>Three days the flowers of the garden fair,<br/>Like stars when the moon is awakened, were,<br/>Or the waves of Baiae, ere luminous<br/>She floats up through the smoke of Vesuvius.<br/><br/>And on the fourth, the Sensitive Plant<br/>Felt the sound of the funeral chant,<br/>And the steps of the bearers, heavy and slow,<br/>And the sobs of the mourners, deep and low;<br/><br/>The weary sound and the heavy breath,<br/>And the silent motions of passing death,<br/>And the smell, cold, oppressive, and dank,<br/>Sent through the pores of the coffin-plank;<br/><br/>The dark grass, and the flowers among the grass,<br/>Were bright with tears as the crowd did pass;<br/>From their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone,<br/>And sate in the pines, and gave groan for groan.<br/><br/>The garden, once fair, became cold and foul,<br/>Like the corpse of her who had been its soul,<br/>Which at first was lovely as if in sleep,<br/>Then slowly changed, till it grew a heap<br/>To make men tremble who never weep.<br/><br/>Swift Summer into the Autumn flowed,<br/>And frost in the mist of the morning rode,<br/>Though the noonday sun looked clear and bright,<br/>Mocking the spoil of the secret night.<br/><br/>The rose-leaves, like flakes of crimson snow,<br/>Paved the turf and the moss below.<br/>The lilies were drooping, and white, and wan,<br/>Like the head and the skin of a dying man.<br/><br/>And Indian plants, of scent and hue<br/>The sweetest that ever were fed on dew,<br/>Leaf by leaf, day after day,<br/>Were massed into the common clay.<br/><br/>And the leaves, brown, yellow, and gray, and red,<br/>And white with the whiteness of what is dead,<br/>Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed;<br/>Their whistling noise made the birds aghast.<br/><br/>And the gusty winds waked the winged seeds,<br/>Out of their birthplace of ugly weeds,<br/>Till they clung round many a sweet flower's stem,<br/>Which rotted into the earth with them.<br/><br/>The water-blooms under the rivulet<br/>Fell from the stalks on which they were set;<br/>And the eddies drove them here and there,<br/>As the winds did those of the upper air.<br/><br/>Then the rain came down, and the broken stalks<br/>Were bent and tangled across the walks;<br/>And the leafless network of parasite bowers<br/>Massed into ruin; and all sweet flowers.<br/><br/>Between the time of the wind and the snow<br/>All loathliest weeds began to grow,<br/>Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck,<br/>Like the water-snake's belly and the toad's back.<br/><br/>And thistles, and nettles, and darnels rank,<br/>And the dock, and henbane, and hemlock dank,<br/>Stretched out its long and hollow shank,<br/>And stifled the air till the dead wind stank.<br/><br/>And plants, at whose names the verse feels loath,<br/>Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth,<br/>Prickly, and pulpous, and blistering, and blue,<br/>Livid, and starred with a lurid dew.<br/><br/>And agarics, and fungi, with mildew and mould<br/>Started like mist from the wet ground cold;<br/>Pale, fleshy, as if the decaying dead<br/>With a spirit of growth had been animated!<br/><br/>Spawn, weeds, and filth, a leprous scum,<br/>Made the running rivulet thick and dumb,<br/>And at its outlet flags huge as stakes<br/>Dammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes.<br/><br/>And hour by hour, when the air was still,<br/>The vapours arose which have strength to kill;<br/>At morn they were seen, at noon they were felt,<br/>At night they were darkness no star could melt.<br/><br/>And unctuous meteors from spray to spray<br/>Crept and flitted in broad noonday<br/>Unseen; every branch on which they alit<br/>By a venomous blight was burned and bit.<br/><br/>The Sensitive Plant, like one forbid,<br/>Wept, and the tears within each lid<br/>Of its folded leaves, which together grew,<br/>Were changed to a blight of frozen glue.<br/><br/>For the leaves soon fell, and the branches soon<br/>By the heavy axe of the blast were hewn;<br/>The sap shrank to the root through every pore<br/>As blood to a heart that will beat no more.<br/><br/>For Winter came: the wind was his whip:<br/>One choppy finger was on his lip:<br/>He had torn the cataracts from the hills<br/>And they clanked at his girdle like manacles;<br/><br/>His breath was a chain which without a sound<br/>The earth, and the air, and the water bound;<br/>He came, fiercely driven, in his chariot-throne<br/>By the tenfold blasts of the Arctic zone.<br/><br/>Then the weeds which were forms of living death<br/>Fled from the frost to the earth beneath.<br/>Their decay and sudden flight from frost<br/>Was but like the vanishing of a ghost!<br/><br/>And under the roots of the Sensitive Plant<br/>The moles and the dormice died for want:<br/>The birds dropped stiff from the frozen air<br/>And were caught in the branches naked and bare.<br/><br/>First there came down a thawing rain<br/>And its dull drops froze on the boughs again;<br/>Then there steamed up a freezing dew<br/>Which to the drops of the thaw-rain grew;<br/><br/>And a northern whirlwind, wandering about<br/>Like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out,<br/>Shook the boughs thus laden, and heavy, and stiff,<br/>And snapped them off with his rigid griff.<br/><br/>When Winter had gone and Spring came back<br/>The Sensitive Plant was a leafless wreck;<br/>But the mandrakes, and toadstools, and docks, and darnels,<br/>Rose like the dead from their ruined charnels.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION.<br/><br/>Whether the Sensitive Plant, or that<br/>Which within its boughs like a Spirit sat,<br/>Ere its outward form had known decay,<br/>Now felt this change, I cannot say.<br/><br/>Whether that Lady's gentle mind,<br/>No longer with the form combined<br/>Which scattered love, as stars do light,<br/>Found sadness, where it left delight,<br/><br/>I dare not guess; but in this life<br/>Of error, ignorance, and strife,<br/>Where nothing is, but all things seem,<br/>And we the shadows of the dream,<br/><br/>It is a modest creed, and yet<br/>Pleasant if one considers it,<br/>To own that death itself must be,<br/>Like all the rest, a mockery.<br/><br/>That garden sweet, that lady fair,<br/>And all sweet shapes and odours there,<br/>In truth have never passed away:<br/>'Tis we, 'tis ours, are changed; not they.<br/><br/>For love, and beauty, and delight,<br/>There is no death nor change: their might<br/>Exceeds our organs, which endure<br/>No light, being themselves obscure.<br/><br/>CANCELLED PASSAGE.<br/><br/>Their moss rotted off them, flake by flake,<br/>Till the thick stalk stuck like a murderer's stake,<br/>Where rags of loose flesh yet tremble on high,<br/>Infecting the winds that wander by.
