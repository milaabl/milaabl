# üíÆ The Owl And The Sparrow by *John Trumbull*

<p>
    In elder days, in Saturn's prime,<br/>Ere baldness seized the head of Time,<br/>While truant Jove, in infant pride,<br/>Play'd barefoot on Olympus' side,<br/>Each thing on earth had power to chatter,<br/>And spoke the mother tongue of nature.<br/>Each stock or stone could prate and gabble,<br/>Worse than ten labourers of Babel.<br/>Along the street, perhaps you'd see<br/>A Post disputing with a Tree,<br/>And mid their arguments of weight,<br/>A Goose sit umpire of debate.<br/>Each Dog you met, though speechless now,<br/>Would make his compliments and bow,<br/>And every Swine with congees come,<br/>To know how did all friends at home.<br/>Each Block sublime could make a speech,<br/>In style and eloquence as rich,<br/>And could pronounce it and could pen it,<br/>As well as Chatham in the senate.<br/><br/><br/>Nor prose alone.--In these young times,<br/>Each field was fruitful too in rhymes;<br/>Each feather'd minstrel felt the passion,<br/>And every wind breathed inspiration.<br/>Each Bullfrog croak'd in loud bombastic,<br/>Each Monkey chatter'd Hudibrastic;<br/>Each Cur, endued with yelping nature,<br/>Could outbark Churchill's[2] self in satire;<br/>Each Crow in prophecy delighted,<br/>Each Owl, you saw, was second-sighted,<br/>Each Goose a skilful politician,<br/>Each Ass a gifted met'physician,<br/>Could preach in wrath 'gainst laughing rogues,<br/>Write Halfway-covenant Dialogues,[3]<br/>And wisely judge of all disputes<br/>In commonwealths of men or brutes.<br/><br/><br/>'Twas then, in spring a youthful Sparrow<br/>Felt the keen force of Cupid's arrow:<br/>For Birds, as √Üsop's tales avow,<br/>Made love then, just as men do now,<br/>And talk'd of deaths and flames and darts,<br/>And breaking necks and losing hearts;<br/>And chose from all th' aerial kind,<br/>Not then to tribes, like Jews, confined<br/>The story tells, a lovely Thrush<br/>Had smit him from a neigh'bring bush,<br/>Where oft the young coquette would play,<br/>And carol sweet her siren lay:<br/>She thrill'd each feather'd heart with love,<br/>And reign'd the Toast of all the grove.<br/><br/><br/>He felt the pain, but did not dare<br/>Disclose his passion to the fair;<br/>For much he fear'd her conscious pride<br/>Of race, to noble blood allied.<br/>Her grandsire's nest conspicuous stood,<br/>Mid loftiest branches of the wood,<br/>In airy height, that scorn'd to know<br/>Each flitting wing that waved below.<br/>So doubting, on a point so nice<br/>He deem'd it best to take advice.<br/><br/><br/>Hard by there dwelt an aged Owl,<br/>Of all his friends the gravest fowl;<br/>Who from the cares of business free,<br/>Lived, hermit, in a hollow tree;<br/>To solid learning bent his mind,<br/>In trope and syllogism he shined,<br/>'Gainst reigning follies spent his railing;<br/>Too much a Stoic--'twas his failing.<br/><br/><br/>Hither for aid our Sparrow came,<br/>And told his errand and his name,<br/>With panting breath explain'd his case,<br/>Much trembling at the sage's face;<br/>And begg'd his Owlship would declare<br/>If love were worth a wise one's care.<br/><br/><br/>The grave Owl heard the weighty cause,<br/>And humm'd and hah'd at every pause;<br/>Then fix'd his looks in sapient plan,<br/>Stretch'd forth one foot, and thus began.<br/><br/><br/>"My son, my son, of love beware,<br/>And shun the cheat of beauty's snare;<br/>That snare more dreadful to be in,<br/>Than huntsman's net, or horse-hair gin.<br/>"By others' harms learn to be wise,"<br/>As ancient proverbs well advise.<br/>Each villany, that nature breeds,<br/>From females and from love proceeds.<br/>'Tis love disturbs with fell debate<br/>Of man and beast the peaceful state:<br/>Men fill the world with war's alarms,<br/>When female trumpets sound to arms;<br/>The commonwealth of dogs delight<br/>For beauties, as for bones, to fight.<br/>Love hath his tens of thousands slain,<br/>And heap'd with copious death the plain:<br/>Samson, with ass's jaw to aid,<br/>Ne'er peopled thus th'infernal shade.<br/><br/><br/>"Nor this the worst; for he that's dead,<br/>With love no more will vex his head.<br/>'Tis in the rolls of fate above,<br/>That death's a certain cure for love;<br/>A noose can end the cruel smart;<br/>The lover's leap is from a cart.<br/>But oft a living death they bear,<br/>Scorn'd by the proud, capricious fair.<br/>The fair to sense pay no regard,<br/>And beauty is the fop's reward;<br/>They slight the generous hearts' esteem,<br/>And sigh for those, who fly from them.<br/><br/><br/>Just when your wishes would prevail,<br/>Some rival bird with gayer tail,<br/>Who sings his strain with sprightlier note,<br/>And chatters praise with livelier throat,<br/>Shall charm your flutt'ring fair one down,<br/>And leave your choice, to hang or drown.<br/><br/><br/>Ev'n I, my son, have felt the smart;<br/>A Pheasant won my youthful heart.<br/>For her I tuned the doleful lay,[4]<br/>For her I watch'd the night away;<br/>In vain I told my piteous case,<br/>And smooth'd my dignity of face;<br/>In vain I cull'd the studied phrase,<br/>And sought hard words in beauty's praise.<br/>Her, not my charms nor sense could move,<br/>For folly is the food of love.<br/>Each female scorns our serious make,<br/>"Each woman is at heart a rake."[5]<br/>Thus Owls in every age have said,<br/>Since our first parent-owl was made;<br/>Thus Pope and Swift, to prove their sense,<br/>Shall sing, some twenty ages hence;<br/>Then shall a man of little fame,<br/>One ** **** sing the same.
