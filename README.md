# üíÆ The Princess (part 3) by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Morn in the wake of the morning star<br/>Came furrowing all the orient into gold.<br/>We rose, and each by other drest with care<br/>Descended to the court that lay three parts<br/>In shadow, but the Muses' heads were touched<br/>Above the darkness from their native East.<br/><br/>There while we stood beside the fount, and watched<br/>Or seemed to watch the dancing bubble, approached<br/>Melissa, tinged with wan from lack of sleep,<br/>Or grief, and glowing round her dewy eyes<br/>The circled Iris of a night of tears;<br/>'And fly,' she cried, 'O fly, while yet you may!<br/>My mother knows:' and when I asked her 'how,'<br/>'My fault' she wept 'my fault! and yet not mine;<br/>Yet mine in part. O hear me, pardon me.<br/>My mother, 'tis her wont from night to night<br/>To rail at Lady Psyche and her side.<br/>She says the Princess should have been the Head,<br/>Herself and Lady Psyche the two arms;<br/>And so it was agreed when first they came;<br/>But Lady Psyche was the right hand now,<br/>And the left, or not, or seldom used;<br/>Hers more than half the students, all the love.<br/>And so last night she fell to canvass you:<br/>~Her~ countrywomen! she did not envy her.<br/>"Who ever saw such wild barbarians?<br/>Girls?--more like men!" and at these words the snake,<br/>My secret, seemed to stir within my breast;<br/>And oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek<br/>Began to burn and burn, and her lynx eye<br/>To fix and make me hotter, till she laughed:<br/>"O marvellously modest maiden, you!<br/>Men! girls, like men! why, if they had been men<br/>You need not set your thoughts in rubric thus<br/>For wholesale comment." Pardon, I am shamed<br/>That I must needs repeat for my excuse<br/>What looks so little graceful: "men" (for still<br/>My mother went revolving on the word)<br/>"And so they are,--very like men indeed--<br/>And with that woman closeted for hours!"<br/>Then came these dreadful words out one by one,<br/>"Why--these--~are~--men:" I shuddered: "and you know it."<br/>"O ask me nothing," I said: "And she knows too,<br/>And she conceals it." So my mother clutched<br/>The truth at once, but with no word from me;<br/>And now thus early risen she goes to inform<br/>The Princess: Lady Psyche will be crushed;<br/>But you may yet be saved, and therefore fly;<br/>But heal me with your pardon ere you go.'<br/><br/>'What pardon, sweet Melissa, for a blush?'<br/>Said Cyril: 'Pale one, blush again: than wear<br/>Those lilies, better blush our lives away.<br/>Yet let us breathe for one hour more in Heaven'<br/>He added, 'lest some classic Angel speak<br/>In scorn of us, "They mounted, Ganymedes,<br/>To tumble, Vulcans, on the second morn."<br/>But I will melt this marble into wax<br/>To yield us farther furlough:' and he went.<br/><br/>Melissa shook her doubtful curls, and thought<br/>He scarce would prosper. 'Tell us,' Florian asked,<br/>'How grew this feud betwixt the right and left.'<br/>'O long ago,' she said, 'betwixt these two<br/>Division smoulders hidden; 'tis my mother,<br/>Too jealous, often fretful as the wind<br/>Pent in a crevice: much I bear with her:<br/>I never knew my father, but she says<br/>(God help her) she was wedded to a fool;<br/>And still she railed against the state of things.<br/>She had the care of Lady Ida's youth,<br/>And from the Queen's decease she brought her up.<br/>But when your sister came she won the heart<br/>Of Ida: they were still together, grew<br/>(For so they said themselves) inosculated;<br/>Consonant chords that shiver to one note;<br/>One mind in all things: yet my mother still<br/>Affirms your Psyche thieved her theories,<br/>And angled with them for her pupil's love:<br/>She calls her plagiarist; I know not what:<br/>But I must go: I dare not tarry,' and light,<br/>As flies the shadow of a bird, she fled.<br/><br/>Then murmured Florian gazing after her,<br/>'An open-hearted maiden, true and pure.<br/>If I could love, why this were she: how pretty<br/>Her blushing was, and how she blushed again,<br/>As if to close with Cyril's random wish:<br/>Not like your Princess crammed with erring pride,<br/>Nor like poor Psyche whom she drags in tow.'<br/><br/>'The crane,' I said, 'may chatter of the crane,<br/>The dove may murmur of the dove, but I<br/>An eagle clang an eagle to the sphere.<br/>My princess, O my princess! true she errs,<br/>But in her own grand way: being herself<br/>Three times more noble than three score of men,<br/>She sees herself in every woman else,<br/>And so she wears her error like a crown<br/>To blind the truth and me: for her, and her,<br/>Hebes are they to hand ambrosia, mix<br/>The nectar; but--ah she--whene'er she moves<br/>The Samian Her√® rises and she speaks<br/>A Memnon smitten with the morning Sun.'<br/><br/>So saying from the court we paced, and gained<br/>The terrace ranged along the Northern front,<br/>And leaning there on those balusters, high<br/>Above the empurpled champaign, drank the gale<br/>That blown about the foliage underneath,<br/>And sated with the innumerable rose,<br/>Beat balm upon our eyelids. Hither came<br/>Cyril, and yawning 'O hard task,' he cried;<br/>'No fighting shadows here! I forced a way<br/>Through opposition crabbed and gnarled.<br/>Better to clear prime forests, heave and thump<br/>A league of street in summer solstice down,<br/>Than hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.<br/>I knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there<br/>At point to move, and settled in her eyes<br/>The green malignant light of coming storm.<br/>Sir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,<br/>As man's could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed<br/>Concealment: she demanded who we were,<br/>And why we came? I fabled nothing fair,<br/>But, your example pilot, told her all.<br/>Up went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.<br/>But when I dwelt upon your old affiance,<br/>She answered sharply that I talked astray.<br/>I urged the fierce inscription on the gate,<br/>And our three lives. True--we had limed ourselves<br/>With open eyes, and we must take the chance.<br/>But such extremes, I told her, well might harm<br/>The woman's cause. "Not more than now," she said,<br/>"So puddled as it is with favouritism."<br/>I tried the mother's heart. Shame might befall<br/>Melissa, knowing, saying not she knew:<br/>Her answer was "Leave me to deal with that."<br/>I spoke of war to come and many deaths,<br/>And she replied, her duty was to speak,<br/>And duty duty, clear of consequences.<br/>I grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew<br/>No rock so hard but that a little wave<br/>May beat admission in a thousand years,<br/>I recommenced; "Decide not ere you pause.<br/>I find you here but in the second place,<br/>Some say the third--the authentic foundress you.<br/>I offer boldly: we will seat you highest:<br/>Wink at our advent: help my prince to gain<br/>His rightful bride, and here I promise you<br/>Some palace in our land, where you shall reign<br/>The head and heart of all our fair she-world,<br/>And your great name flow on with broadening time<br/>For ever." Well, she balanced this a little,<br/>And told me she would answer us today,<br/>meantime be mute: thus much, nor more I gained.'<br/><br/>He ceasing, came a message from the Head.<br/>'That afternoon the Princess rode to take<br/>The dip of certain strata to the North.<br/>Would we go with her? we should find the land<br/>Worth seeing; and the river made a fall<br/>Out yonder:' then she pointed on to where<br/>A double hill ran up his furrowy forks<br/>Beyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.<br/><br/>Agreed to, this, the day fled on through all<br/>Its range of duties to the appointed hour.<br/>Then summoned to the porch we went. She stood<br/>Among her maidens, higher by the head,<br/>Her back against a pillar, her foot on one<br/>Of those tame leopards. Kittenlike he rolled<br/>And pawed about her sandal. I drew near;<br/>I gazed. On a sudden my strange seizure came<br/>Upon me, the weird vision of our house:<br/>The Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,<br/>Her gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,<br/>Her college and her maidens, empty masks,<br/>And I myself the shadow of a dream,<br/>For all things were and were not. Yet I felt<br/>My heart beat thick with passion and with awe;<br/>Then from my breast the involuntary sigh<br/>Brake, as she smote me with the light of eyes<br/>That lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook<br/>My pulses, till to horse we got, and so<br/>Went forth in long retinue following up<br/>The river as it narrowed to the hills.<br/><br/>I rode beside her and to me she said:<br/>'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not<br/>Too harsh to your companion yestermorn;<br/>Unwillingly we spake.' 'No--not to her,'<br/>I answered, 'but to one of whom we spake<br/>Your Highness might have seemed the thing you say.'<br/>'Again?' she cried, 'are you ambassadresses<br/>From him to me? we give you, being strange,<br/>A license: speak, and let the topic die.'<br/><br/>I stammered that I knew him--could have wished--<br/>'Our king expects--was there no precontract?<br/>There is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem<br/>All he prefigured, and he could not see<br/>The bird of passage flying south but longed<br/>To follow: surely, if your Highness keep<br/>Your purport, you will shock him even to death,<br/>Or baser courses, children of despair.'<br/><br/>'Poor boy,' she said, 'can he not read--no books?<br/>Quoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that<br/>Which men delight in, martial exercise?<br/>To nurse a blind ideal like a girl,<br/>Methinks he seems no better than a girl;<br/>As girls were once, as we ourself have been:<br/>We had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:<br/>We touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,<br/>Being other--since we learnt our meaning here,<br/>To lift the woman's fallen divinity<br/>Upon an even pedestal with man.'<br/><br/>She paused, and added with a haughtier smile<br/>'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,<br/>At no man's beck, but know ourself and thee,<br/>O Vashti, noble Vashti! Summoned out<br/>She kept her state, and left the drunken king<br/>To brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.'<br/><br/>'Alas your Highness breathes full East,' I said,<br/>'On that which leans to you. I know the Prince,<br/>I prize his truth: and then how vast a work<br/>To assail this gray pre√´minence of man!<br/>You grant me license; might I use it? think;<br/>Ere half be done perchance your life may fail;<br/>Then comes the feebler heiress of your plan,<br/>And takes and ruins all; and thus your pains<br/>May only make that footprint upon sand<br/>Which old-recurring waves of prejudice<br/>Resmooth to nothing: might I dread that you,<br/>With only Fame for spouse and your great deeds<br/>For issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,<br/>Meanwhile, what every woman counts her due,<br/>Love, children, happiness?'<br/>And she exclaimed,<br/>'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!<br/>What! though your Prince's love were like a God's,<br/>Have we not made ourself the sacrifice?<br/>You are bold indeed: we are not talked to thus:<br/>Yet will we say for children, would they grew<br/>Like field-flowers everywhere! we like them well:<br/>But children die; and let me tell you, girl,<br/>Howe'er you babble, great deeds cannot die;<br/>They with the sun and moon renew their light<br/>For ever, blessing those that look on them.<br/>Children--that men may pluck them from our hearts,<br/>Kill us with pity, break us with ourselves--<br/>O--children--there is nothing upon earth<br/>More miserable than she that has a son<br/>And sees him err: nor would we work for fame;<br/>Though she perhaps might reap the applause of Great,<br/>Who earns the one POU STO whence after-hands<br/>May move the world, though she herself effect<br/>But little: wherefore up and act, nor shrink<br/>For fear our solid aim be dissipated<br/>By frail successors. Would, indeed, we had been,<br/>In lieu of many mortal flies, a race<br/>Of giants living, each, a thousand years,<br/>That we might see our own work out, and watch<br/>The sandy footprint harden into stone.'<br/><br/>I answered nothing, doubtful in myself<br/>If that strange Poet-princess with her grand<br/>Imaginations might at all be won.<br/>And she broke out interpreting my thoughts:<br/><br/>'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;<br/>We are used to that: for women, up till this<br/>Cramped under worse than South-sea-isle taboo,<br/>Dwarfs of the gyn√¶ceum, fail so far<br/>In high desire, they know not, cannot guess<br/>How much their welfare is a passion to us.<br/>If we could give them surer, quicker proof--<br/>Oh if our end were less achievable<br/>By slow approaches, than by single act<br/>Of immolation, any phase of death,<br/>We were as prompt to spring against the pikes,<br/>Or down the fiery gulf as talk of it,<br/>To compass our dear sisters' liberties.'<br/><br/>She bowed as if to veil a noble tear;<br/>And up we came to where the river sloped<br/>To plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks<br/>A breadth of thunder. O'er it shook the woods,<br/>And danced the colour, and, below, stuck out<br/>The bones of some vast bulk that lived and roared<br/>Before man was. She gazed awhile and said,<br/>'As these rude bones to us, are we to her<br/>That will be.' 'Dare we dream of that,' I asked,<br/>'Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,<br/>That practice betters?' 'How,' she cried, 'you love<br/>The metaphysics! read and earn our prize,<br/>A golden brooch: beneath an emerald plane<br/>Sits Diotima, teaching him that died<br/>Of hemlock; our device; wrought to the life;<br/>She rapt upon her subject, he on her:<br/>For there are schools for all.' 'And yet' I said<br/>'Methinks I have not found among them all<br/>One anatomic.' 'Nay, we thought of that,'<br/>She answered, 'but it pleased us not: in truth<br/>We shudder but to dream our maids should ape<br/>Those monstrous males that carve the living hound,<br/>And cram him with the fragments of the grave,<br/>Or in the dark dissolving human heart,<br/>And holy secrets of this microcosm,<br/>Dabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,<br/>Encarnalize their spirits: yet we know<br/>Knowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:<br/>Howbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,<br/>Nor willing men should come among us, learnt,<br/>For many weary moons before we came,<br/>This craft of healing. Were you sick, ourself<br/>Would tend upon you. To your question now,<br/>Which touches on the workman and his work.<br/>Let there be light and there was light: 'tis so:<br/>For was, and is, and will be, are but is;<br/>And all creation is one act at once,<br/>The birth of light: but we that are not all,<br/>As parts, can see but parts, now this, now that,<br/>And live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make<br/>One act a phantom of succession: thus<br/>Our weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time;<br/>But in the shadow will we work, and mould<br/>The woman to the fuller day.'<br/>She spake<br/>With kindled eyes; we rode a league beyond,<br/>And, o'er a bridge of pinewood crossing, came<br/>On flowery levels underneath the crag,<br/>Full of all beauty. 'O how sweet' I said<br/>(For I was half-oblivious of my mask)<br/>'To linger here with one that loved us.' 'Yea,'<br/>She answered, 'or with fair philosophies<br/>That lift the fancy; for indeed these fields<br/>Are lovely, lovelier not the Elysian lawns,<br/>Where paced the Demigods of old, and saw<br/>The soft white vapour streak the crown√®d towers<br/>Built to the Sun:' then, turning to her maids,<br/>'Pitch our pavilion here upon the sward;<br/>Lay out the viands.' At the word, they raised<br/>A tent of satin, elaborately wrought<br/>With fair Corinna's triumph; here she stood,<br/>Engirt with many a florid maiden-cheek,<br/>The woman-conqueror; woman-conquered there<br/>The bearded Victor of ten-thousand hymns,<br/>And all the men mourned at his side: but we<br/>Set forth to climb; then, climbing, Cyril kept<br/>With Psyche, with Melissa Florian, I<br/>With mine affianced. Many a little hand<br/>Glanced like a touch of sunshine on the rocks,<br/>Many a light foot shone like a jewel set<br/>In the dark crag: and then we turned, we wound<br/>About the cliffs, the copses, out and in,<br/>Hammering and clinking, chattering stony names<br/>Of shales and hornblende, rag and trap and tuff,<br/>Amygdaloid and trachyte, till the Sun<br/>Grew broader toward his death and fell, and all<br/>The rosy heights came out above the lawns.<br/><br/><br/>The splendour falls on castle walls<br/>And snowy summits old in story:<br/>The long light shakes across the lakes,<br/>And the wild cataract leaps in glory.<br/>Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,<br/>Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.<br/><br/>O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,<br/>And thinner, clearer, farther going!<br/>O sweet and far from cliff and scar<br/>The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!<br/>Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:<br/>Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.<br/><br/>O love, they die in yon rich sky,<br/>They faint on hill or field or river:<br/>Our echoes roll from soul to soul,<br/>And grow for ever and for ever.<br/>Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,<br/>And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.
