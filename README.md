# üíÆ Guinevere by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat<br/>There in the holy house at Almesbury<br/>Weeping, none with her save a little maid,<br/>A novice: one low light betwixt them burned<br/>Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad,<br/>Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,<br/>The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,<br/>Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.<br/><br/>For hither had she fled, her cause of flight<br/>Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast<br/>Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne,<br/>Ready to spring, waiting a chance: for this<br/>He chilled the popular praises of the King<br/>With silent smiles of slow disparagement;<br/>And tampered with the Lords of the White Horse,<br/>Heathen, the brood by Hengist left; and sought<br/>To make disruption in the Table Round<br/>Of Arthur, and to splinter it into feuds<br/>Serving his traitorous end; and all his aims<br/>Were sharpened by strong hate for Lancelot.<br/><br/>For thus it chanced one morn when all the court,<br/>Green-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,<br/>Had been, their wont, a-maying and returned,<br/>That Modred still in green, all ear and eye,<br/>Climbed to the high top of the garden-wall<br/>To spy some secret scandal if he might,<br/>And saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best<br/>Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court<br/>The wiliest and the worst; and more than this<br/>He saw not, for Sir Lancelot passing by<br/>Spied where he couched, and as the gardener's hand<br/>Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar,<br/>So from the high wall and the flowering grove<br/>Of grasses Lancelot plucked him by the heel,<br/>And cast him as a worm upon the way;<br/>But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust,<br/>He, reverencing king's blood in a bad man,<br/>Made such excuses as he might, and these<br/>Full knightly without scorn; for in those days<br/>No knight of Arthur's noblest dealt in scorn;<br/>But, if a man were halt or hunched, in him<br/>By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall,<br/>Scorn was allowed as part of his defect,<br/>And he was answered softly by the King<br/>And all his Table. So Sir Lancelot holp<br/>To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice<br/>Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went:<br/>But, ever after, the small violence done<br/>Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart,<br/>As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long<br/>A little bitter pool about a stone<br/>On the bare coast.<br/><br/>But when Sir Lancelot told<br/>This matter to the Queen, at first she laughed<br/>Lightly, to think of Modred's dusty fall,<br/>Then shuddered, as the village wife who cries<br/>`I shudder, some one steps across my grave;'<br/>Then laughed again, but faintlier, for indeed<br/>She half-foresaw that he, the subtle beast,<br/>Would track her guilt until he found, and hers<br/>Would be for evermore a name of scorn.<br/>Henceforward rarely could she front in hall,<br/>Or elsewhere, Modred's narrow foxy face,<br/>Heart-hiding smile, and gray persistent eye:<br/>Henceforward too, the Powers that tend the soul,<br/>To help it from the death that cannot die,<br/>And save it even in extremes, began<br/>To vex and plague her. Many a time for hours,<br/>Beside the placid breathings of the King,<br/>In the dead night, grim faces came and went<br/>Before her, or a vague spiritual fear--<br/>Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,<br/>Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,<br/>That keeps the rust of murder on the walls--<br/>Held her awake: or if she slept, she dreamed<br/>An awful dream; for then she seemed to stand<br/>On some vast plain before a setting sun,<br/>And from the sun there swiftly made at her<br/>A ghastly something, and its shadow flew<br/>Before it, till it touched her, and she turned--<br/>When lo! her own, that broadening from her feet,<br/>And blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it<br/>Far cities burnt, and with a cry she woke.<br/>And all this trouble did not pass but grew;<br/>Till even the clear face of the guileless King,<br/>And trustful courtesies of household life,<br/>Became her bane; and at the last she said,<br/>`O Lancelot, get thee hence to thine own land,<br/>For if thou tarry we shall meet again,<br/>And if we meet again, some evil chance<br/>Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze<br/>Before the people, and our lord the King.'<br/>And Lancelot ever promised, but remained,<br/>And still they met and met. Again she said,<br/>`O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence.'<br/>And then they were agreed upon a night<br/>(When the good King should not be there) to meet<br/>And part for ever. Vivien, lurking, heard.<br/>She told Sir Modred. Passion-pale they met<br/>And greeted. Hands in hands, and eye to eye,<br/>Low on the border of her couch they sat<br/>Stammering and staring. It was their last hour,<br/>A madness of farewells. And Modred brought<br/>His creatures to the basement of the tower<br/>For testimony; and crying with full voice<br/>`Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last,' aroused<br/>Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike<br/>Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell<br/>Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off,<br/>And all was still: then she, `The end is come,<br/>And I am shamed for ever;' and he said,<br/>`Mine be the shame; mine was the sin: but rise,<br/>And fly to my strong castle overseas:<br/>There will I hide thee, till my life shall end,<br/>There hold thee with my life against the world.'<br/>She answered, `Lancelot, wilt thou hold me so?<br/>Nay, friend, for we have taken our farewells.<br/>Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself!<br/>Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou<br/>Unwedded: yet rise now, and let us fly,<br/>For I will draw me into sanctuary,<br/>And bide my doom.' So Lancelot got her horse,<br/>Set her thereon, and mounted on his own,<br/>And then they rode to the divided way,<br/>There kissed, and parted weeping: for he past,<br/>Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen,<br/>Back to his land; but she to Almesbury<br/>Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald,<br/>And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald<br/>Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan:<br/>And in herself she moaned `Too late, too late!'<br/>Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn,<br/>A blot in heaven, the Raven, flying high,<br/>Croaked, and she thought, `He spies a field of death;<br/>For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea,<br/>Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court,<br/>Begin to slay the folk, and spoil the land.'<br/><br/>And when she came to Almesbury she spake<br/>There to the nuns, and said, `Mine enemies<br/>Pursue me, but, O peaceful Sisterhood,<br/>Receive, and yield me sanctuary, nor ask<br/>Her name to whom ye yield it, till her time<br/>To tell you:' and her beauty, grace and power,<br/>Wrought as a charm upon them, and they spared<br/>To ask it.<br/><br/>So the stately Queen abode<br/>For many a week, unknown, among the nuns;<br/>Nor with them mixed, nor told her name, nor sought,<br/>Wrapt in her grief, for housel or for shrift,<br/>But communed only with the little maid,<br/>Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness<br/>Which often lured her from herself; but now,<br/>This night, a rumour wildly blown about<br/>Came, that Sir Modred had usurped the realm,<br/>And leagued him with the heathen, while the King<br/>Was waging war on Lancelot: then she thought,<br/>`With what a hate the people and the King<br/>Must hate me,' and bowed down upon her hands<br/>Silent, until the little maid, who brooked<br/>No silence, brake it, uttering, `Late! so late!<br/>What hour, I wonder, now?' and when she drew<br/>No answer, by and by began to hum<br/>An air the nuns had taught her; `Late, so late!'<br/>Which when she heard, the Queen looked up, and said,<br/>`O maiden, if indeed ye list to sing,<br/>Sing, and unbind my heart that I may weep.'<br/>Whereat full willingly sang the little maid.<br/><br/>`Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!<br/>Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.<br/>Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.<br/><br/>`No light had we: for that we do repent;<br/>And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.<br/>Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.<br/><br/>`No light: so late! and dark and chill the night!<br/>O let us in, that we may find the light!<br/>Too late, too late: ye cannot enter now.<br/><br/>`Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?<br/>O let us in, though late, to kiss his feet!<br/>No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.'<br/><br/>So sang the novice, while full passionately,<br/>Her head upon her hands, remembering<br/>Her thought when first she came, wept the sad Queen.<br/>Then said the little novice prattling to her,<br/>`O pray you, noble lady, weep no more;<br/>But let my words, the words of one so small,<br/>Who knowing nothing knows but to obey,<br/>And if I do not there is penance given--<br/>Comfort your sorrows; for they do not flow<br/>From evil done; right sure am I of that,<br/>Who see your tender grace and stateliness.<br/>But weigh your sorrows with our lord the King's,<br/>And weighing find them less; for gone is he<br/>To wage grim war against Sir Lancelot there,<br/>Round that strong castle where he holds the Queen;<br/>And Modred whom he left in charge of all,<br/>The traitor--Ah sweet lady, the King's grief<br/>For his own self, and his own Queen, and realm,<br/>Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours.<br/>For me, I thank the saints, I am not great.<br/>For if there ever come a grief to me<br/>I cry my cry in silence, and have done.<br/>None knows it, and my tears have brought me good:<br/>But even were the griefs of little ones<br/>As great as those of great ones, yet this grief<br/>Is added to the griefs the great must bear,<br/>That howsoever much they may desire<br/>Silence, they cannot weep behind a cloud:<br/>As even here they talk at Almesbury<br/>About the good King and his wicked Queen,<br/>And were I such a King with such a Queen,<br/>Well might I wish to veil her wickedness,<br/>But were I such a King, it could not be.'<br/><br/>Then to her own sad heart muttered the Queen,<br/>`Will the child kill me with her innocent talk?'<br/>But openly she answered, `Must not I,<br/>If this false traitor have displaced his lord,<br/>Grieve with the common grief of all the realm?'<br/><br/>`Yea,' said the maid, `this is all woman's grief,<br/>That SHE is woman, whose disloyal life<br/>Hath wrought confusion in the Table Round<br/>Which good King Arthur founded, years ago,<br/>With signs and miracles and wonders, there<br/>At Camelot, ere the coming of the Queen.'<br/><br/>Then thought the Queen within herself again,<br/>`Will the child kill me with her foolish prate?'<br/>But openly she spake and said to her,<br/>`O little maid, shut in by nunnery walls,<br/>What canst thou know of Kings and Tables Round,<br/>Or what of signs and wonders, but the signs<br/>And simple miracles of thy nunnery?'<br/><br/>To whom the little novice garrulously,<br/>`Yea, but I know: the land was full of signs<br/>And wonders ere the coming of the Queen.<br/>So said my father, and himself was knight<br/>Of the great Table--at the founding of it;<br/>And rode thereto from Lyonnesse, and he said<br/>That as he rode, an hour or maybe twain<br/>After the sunset, down the coast, he heard<br/>Strange music, and he paused, and turning--there,<br/>All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse,<br/>Each with a beacon-star upon his head,<br/>And with a wild sea-light about his feet,<br/>He saw them--headland after headland flame<br/>Far on into the rich heart of the west:<br/>And in the light the white mermaiden swam,<br/>And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,<br/>And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,<br/>To which the little elves of chasm and cleft<br/>Made answer, sounding like a distant horn.<br/>So said my father--yea, and furthermore,<br/>Next morning, while he past the dim-lit woods,<br/>Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy<br/>Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower,<br/>That shook beneath them, as the thistle shakes<br/>When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed:<br/>And still at evenings on before his horse<br/>The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke<br/>Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke<br/>Flying, for all the land was full of life.<br/>And when at last he came to Camelot,<br/>A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand<br/>Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall;<br/>And in the hall itself was such a feast<br/>As never man had dreamed; for every knight<br/>Had whatsoever meat he longed for served<br/>By hands unseen; and even as he said<br/>Down in the cellars merry bloated things<br/>Shouldered the spigot, straddling on the butts<br/>While the wine ran: so glad were spirits and men<br/>Before the coming of the sinful Queen.'<br/><br/>Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly,<br/>`Were they so glad? ill prophets were they all,<br/>Spirits and men: could none of them foresee,<br/>Not even thy wise father with his signs<br/>And wonders, what has fallen upon the realm?'<br/><br/>To whom the novice garrulously again,<br/>`Yea, one, a bard; of whom my father said,<br/>Full many a noble war-song had he sung,<br/>Even in the presence of an enemy's fleet,<br/>Between the steep cliff and the coming wave;<br/>And many a mystic lay of life and death<br/>Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops,<br/>When round him bent the spirits of the hills<br/>With all their dewy hair blown back like flame:<br/>So said my father--and that night the bard<br/>Sang Arthur's glorious wars, and sang the King<br/>As wellnigh more than man, and railed at those<br/>Who called him the false son of Gorlos:<br/>For there was no man knew from whence he came;<br/>But after tempest, when the long wave broke<br/>All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos,<br/>There came a day as still as heaven, and then<br/>They found a naked child upon the sands<br/>Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea;<br/>And that was Arthur; and they fostered him<br/>Till he by miracle was approven King:<br/>And that his grave should be a mystery<br/>From all men, like his birth; and could he find<br/>A woman in her womanhood as great<br/>As he was in his manhood, then, he sang,<br/>The twain together well might change the world.<br/>But even in the middle of his song<br/>He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp,<br/>And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen,<br/>But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell<br/>His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw<br/>This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen?'<br/><br/>Then thought the Queen, `Lo! they have set her on,<br/>Our simple-seeming Abbess and her nuns,<br/>To play upon me,' and bowed her head nor spake.<br/>Whereat the novice crying, with clasped hands,<br/>Shame on her own garrulity garrulously,<br/>Said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue<br/>Full often, `and, sweet lady, if I seem<br/>To vex an ear too sad to listen to me,<br/>Unmannerly, with prattling and the tales<br/>Which my good father told me, check me too<br/>Nor let me shame my father's memory, one<br/>Of noblest manners, though himself would say<br/>Sir Lancelot had the noblest; and he died,<br/>Killed in a tilt, come next, five summers back,<br/>And left me; but of others who remain,<br/>And of the two first-famed for courtesy--<br/>And pray you check me if I ask amiss-<br/>But pray you, which had noblest, while you moved<br/>Among them, Lancelot or our lord the King?'<br/><br/>Then the pale Queen looked up and answered her,<br/>`Sir Lancelot, as became a noble knight,<br/>Was gracious to all ladies, and the same<br/>In open battle or the tilting-field<br/>Forbore his own advantage, and the King<br/>In open battle or the tilting-field<br/>Forbore his own advantage, and these two<br/>Were the most nobly-mannered men of all;<br/>For manners are not idle, but the fruit<br/>Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.'<br/><br/>`Yea,' said the maid, `be manners such fair fruit?'<br/>Then Lancelot's needs must be a thousand-fold<br/>Less noble, being, as all rumour runs,<br/>The most disloyal friend in all the world.'<br/><br/>To which a mournful answer made the Queen:<br/>`O closed about by narrowing nunnery-walls,<br/>What knowest thou of the world, and all its lights<br/>And shadows, all the wealth and all the woe?<br/>If ever Lancelot, that most noble knight,<br/>Were for one hour less noble than himself,<br/>Pray for him that he scape the doom of fire,<br/>And weep for her that drew him to his doom.'<br/><br/>`Yea,' said the little novice, `I pray for both;<br/>But I should all as soon believe that his,<br/>Sir Lancelot's, were as noble as the King's,<br/>As I could think, sweet lady, yours would be<br/>Such as they are, were you the sinful Queen.'<br/><br/>So she, like many another babbler, hurt<br/>Whom she would soothe, and harmed where she would heal;<br/>For here a sudden flush of wrathful heat<br/>Fired all the pale face of the Queen, who cried,<br/>`Such as thou art be never maiden more<br/>For ever! thou their tool, set on to plague<br/>And play upon, and harry me, petty spy<br/>And traitress.' When that storm of anger brake<br/>From Guinevere, aghast the maiden rose,<br/>White as her veil, and stood before the Queen<br/>As tremulously as foam upon the beach<br/>Stands in a wind, ready to break and fly,<br/>And when the Queen had added `Get thee hence,'<br/>Fled frighted. Then that other left alone<br/>Sighed, and began to gather heart again,<br/>Saying in herself, `The simple, fearful child<br/>Meant nothing, but my own too-fearful guilt,<br/>Simpler than any child, betrays itself.<br/>But help me, heaven, for surely I repent.<br/>For what is true repentance but in thought--<br/>Not even in inmost thought to think again<br/>The sins that made the past so pleasant to us:<br/>And I have sworn never to see him more,<br/>To see him more.'<br/><br/>And even in saying this,<br/>Her memory from old habit of the mind<br/>Went slipping back upon the golden days<br/>In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came,<br/>Reputed the best knight and goodliest man,<br/>Ambassador, to lead her to his lord<br/>Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead<br/>Of his and her retinue moving, they,<br/>Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love<br/>And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time<br/>Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed,)<br/>Rode under groves that looked a paradise<br/>Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth<br/>That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth,<br/>And on from hill to hill, and every day<br/>Beheld at noon in some delicious dale<br/>The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised<br/>For brief repast or afternoon repose<br/>By couriers gone before; and on again,<br/>Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw<br/>The Dragon of the great Pendragonship,<br/>That crowned the state pavilion of the King,<br/>Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well.<br/><br/>But when the Queen immersed in such a trance,<br/>And moving through the past unconsciously,<br/>Came to that point where first she saw the King<br/>Ride toward her from the city, sighed to find<br/>Her journey done, glanced at him, thought him cold,<br/>High, self-contained, and passionless, not like him,<br/>`Not like my Lancelot'--while she brooded thus<br/>And grew half-guilty in her thoughts again,<br/>There rode an armd warrior to the doors.<br/>A murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran,<br/>Then on a sudden a cry, `The King.' She sat<br/>Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armd feet<br/>Through the long gallery from the outer doors<br/>Rang coming, prone from off her seat she fell,<br/>And grovelled with her face against the floor:<br/>There with her milkwhite arms and shadowy hair<br/>She made her face a darkness from the King:<br/>And in the darkness heard his armd feet<br/>Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,<br/>Monotonous and hollow like a Ghost's<br/>Denouncing judgment, but though changed, the King's:<br/><br/>`Liest thou here so low, the child of one<br/>I honoured, happy, dead before thy shame?<br/>Well is it that no child is born of thee.<br/>The children born of thee are sword and fire,<br/>Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws,<br/>The craft of kindred and the Godless hosts<br/>Of heathen swarming o'er the Northern Sea;<br/>Whom I, while yet Sir Lancelot, my right arm,<br/>The mightiest of my knights, abode with me,<br/>Have everywhere about this land of Christ<br/>In twelve great battles ruining overthrown.<br/>And knowest thou now from whence I come--from him<br/>From waging bitter war with him: and he,<br/>That did not shun to smite me in worse way,<br/>Had yet that grace of courtesy in him left,<br/>He spared to lift his hand against the King<br/>Who made him knight: but many a knight was slain;<br/>And many more, and all his kith and kin<br/>Clave to him, and abode in his own land.<br/>And many more when Modred raised revolt,<br/>Forgetful of their troth and fealty, clave<br/>To Modred, and a remnant stays with me.<br/>And of this remnant will I leave a part,<br/>True men who love me still, for whom I live,<br/>To guard thee in the wild hour coming on,<br/>Lest but a hair of this low head be harmed.<br/>Fear not: thou shalt be guarded till my death.<br/>Howbeit I know, if ancient prophecies<br/>Have erred not, that I march to meet my doom.<br/>Thou hast not made my life so sweet to me,<br/>That I the King should greatly care to live;<br/>For thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life.<br/>Bear with me for the last time while I show,<br/>Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned.<br/>For when the Roman left us, and their law<br/>Relaxed its hold upon us, and the ways<br/>Were filled with rapine, here and there a deed<br/>Of prowess done redressed a random wrong.<br/>But I was first of all the kings who drew<br/>The knighthood-errant of this realm and all<br/>The realms together under me, their Head,<br/>In that fair Order of my Table Round,<br/>A glorious company, the flower of men,<br/>To serve as model for the mighty world,<br/>And be the fair beginning of a time.<br/>I made them lay their hands in mine and swear<br/>To reverence the King, as if he were<br/>Their conscience, and their conscience as their King,<br/>To break the heathen and uphold the Christ,<br/>To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,<br/>To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,<br/>To honour his own word as if his God's,<br/>To lead sweet lives in purest chastity,<br/>To love one maiden only, cleave to her,<br/>And worship her by years of noble deeds,<br/>Until they won her; for indeed I knew<br/>Of no more subtle master under heaven<br/>Than is the maiden passion for a maid,<br/>Not only to keep down the base in man,<br/>But teach high thought, and amiable words<br/>And courtliness, and the desire of fame,<br/>And love of truth, and all that makes a man.<br/>And all this throve before I wedded thee,<br/>Believing, "lo mine helpmate, one to feel<br/>My purpose and rejoicing in my joy."<br/>Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot;<br/>Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt;<br/>Then others, following these my mightiest knights,<br/>And drawing foul ensample from fair names,<br/>Sinned also, till the loathsome opposite<br/>Of all my heart had destined did obtain,<br/>And all through thee! so that this life of mine<br/>I guard as God's high gift from scathe and wrong,<br/>Not greatly care to lose; but rather think<br/>How sad it were for Arthur, should he live,<br/>To sit once more within his lonely hall,<br/>And miss the wonted number of my knights,<br/>And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds<br/>As in the golden days before thy sin.<br/>For which of us, who might be left, could speak<br/>Of the pure heart, nor seem to glance at thee?<br/>And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk<br/>Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,<br/>And I should evermore be vext with thee<br/>In hanging robe or vacant ornament,<br/>Or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair.<br/>For think not, though thou wouldst not love thy lord,<br/>Thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee.<br/>I am not made of so slight elements.<br/>Yet must I leave thee, woman, to thy shame.<br/>I hold that man the worst of public foes<br/>Who either for his own or children's sake,<br/>To save his blood from scandal, lets the wife<br/>Whom he knows false, abide and rule the house:<br/>For being through his cowardice allowed<br/>Her station, taken everywhere for pure,<br/>She like a new disease, unknown to men,<br/>Creeps, no precaution used, among the crowd,<br/>Makes wicked lightnings of her eyes, and saps<br/>The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse<br/>With devil's leaps, and poisons half the young.<br/>Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns!<br/>Better the King's waste hearth and aching heart<br/>Than thou reseated in thy place of light,<br/>The mockery of my people, and their bane.'<br/><br/>He paused, and in the pause she crept an inch<br/>Nearer, and laid her hands about his feet.<br/>Far off a solitary trumpet blew.<br/>Then waiting by the doors the warhorse neighed<br/>At a friend's voice, and he spake again:<br/><br/>`Yet think not that I come to urge thy crimes,<br/>I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,<br/>I, whose vast pity almost makes me die<br/>To see thee, laying there thy golden head,<br/>My pride in happier summers, at my feet.<br/>The wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law,<br/>The doom of treason and the flaming death,<br/>(When first I learnt thee hidden here) is past.<br/>The pang--which while I weighed thy heart with one<br/>Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee,<br/>Made my tears burn--is also past--in part.<br/>And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I,<br/>Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God<br/>Forgives: do thou for thine own soul the rest.<br/>But how to take last leave of all I loved?<br/>O golden hair, with which I used to play<br/>Not knowing! O imperial-moulded form,<br/>And beauty such as never woman wore,<br/>Until it became a kingdom's curse with thee--<br/>I cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine,<br/>But Lancelot's: nay, they never were the King's.<br/>I cannot take thy hand: that too is flesh,<br/>And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh,<br/>Here looking down on thine polluted, cries<br/>"I loathe thee:" yet not less, O Guinevere,<br/>For I was ever virgin save for thee,<br/>My love through flesh hath wrought into my life<br/>So far, that my doom is, I love thee still.<br/>Let no man dream but that I love thee still.<br/>Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul,<br/>And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,<br/>Hereafter in that world where all are pure<br/>We two may meet before high God, and thou<br/>Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know<br/>I am thine husband--not a smaller soul,<br/>Nor Lancelot, nor another. Leave me that,<br/>I charge thee, my last hope. Now must I hence.<br/>Through the thick night I hear the trumpet blow:<br/>They summon me their King to lead mine hosts<br/>Far down to that great battle in the west,<br/>Where I must strike against the man they call<br/>My sister's son--no kin of mine, who leagues<br/>With Lords of the White Horse, heathen, and knights,<br/>Traitors--and strike him dead, and meet myself<br/>Death, or I know not what mysterious doom.<br/>And thou remaining here wilt learn the event;<br/>But hither shall I never come again,<br/>Never lie by thy side; see thee no more--<br/>Farewell!'<br/><br/>And while she grovelled at his feet,<br/>She felt the King's breath wander o'er her neck,<br/>And in the darkness o'er her fallen head,<br/>Perceived the waving of his hands that blest.<br/><br/>Then, listening till those armd steps were gone,<br/>Rose the pale Queen, and in her anguish found<br/>The casement: `peradventure,' so she thought,<br/>`If I might see his face, and not be seen.'<br/>And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!<br/>And near him the sad nuns with each a light<br/>Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,<br/>To guard and foster her for evermore.<br/>And while he spake to these his helm was lowered,<br/>To which for crest the golden dragon clung<br/>Of Britain; so she did not see the face,<br/>Which then was as an angel's, but she saw,<br/>Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights,<br/>The Dragon of the great Pendragonship<br/>Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire.<br/>And even then he turned; and more and more<br/>The moony vapour rolling round the King,<br/>Who seemed the phantom of a Giant in it,<br/>Enwound him fold by fold, and made him gray<br/>And grayer, till himself became as mist<br/>Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.<br/><br/>Then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud<br/>`Oh Arthur!' there her voice brake suddenly,<br/>Then--as a stream that spouting from a cliff<br/>Fails in mid air, but gathering at the base<br/>Re-makes itself, and flashes down the vale--<br/>Went on in passionate utterance:<br/><br/>`Gone--my lord!<br/>Gone through my sin to slay and to be slain!<br/>And he forgave me, and I could not speak.<br/>Farewell? I should have answered his farewell.<br/>His mercy choked me. Gone, my lord the King,<br/>My own true lord! how dare I call him mine?<br/>The shadow of another cleaves to me,<br/>And makes me one pollution: he, the King,<br/>Called me polluted: shall I kill myself?<br/>What help in that? I cannot kill my sin,<br/>If soul be soul; nor can I kill my shame;<br/>No, nor by living can I live it down.<br/>The days will grow to weeks, the weeks to months<br/>The months will add themselves and make the years,<br/>The years will roll into the centuries,<br/>And mine will ever be a name of scorn.<br/>I must not dwell on that defeat of fame.<br/>Let the world be; that is but of the world.<br/>What else? what hope? I think there was a hope,<br/>Except he mocked me when he spake of hope;<br/>His hope he called it; but he never mocks,<br/>For mockery is the fume of little hearts.<br/>And blessd be the King, who hath forgiven<br/>My wickedness to him, and left me hope<br/>That in mine own heart I can live down sin<br/>And be his mate hereafter in the heavens<br/>Before high God. Ah great and gentle lord,<br/>Who wast, as is the conscience of a saint<br/>Among his warring senses, to thy knights--<br/>To whom my false voluptuous pride, that took<br/>Full easily all impressions from below,<br/>Would not look up, or half-despised the height<br/>To which I would not or I could not climb--<br/>I thought I could not breathe in that fine air<br/>That pure severity of perfect light--<br/>I yearned for warmth and colour which I found<br/>In Lancelot--now I see thee what thou art,<br/>Thou art the highest and most human too,<br/>Not Lancelot, nor another. Is there none<br/>Will tell the King I love him though so late?<br/>Now--ere he goes to the great Battle? none:<br/>Myself must tell him in that purer life,<br/>But now it were too daring. Ah my God,<br/>What might I not have made of thy fair world,<br/>Had I but loved thy highest creature here?<br/>It was my duty to have loved the highest:<br/>It surely was my profit had I known:<br/>It would have been my pleasure had I seen.<br/>We needs must love the highest when we see it,<br/>Not Lancelot, nor another.'<br/><br/>Here her hand<br/>Grasped, made her vail her eyes: she looked and saw<br/>The novice, weeping, suppliant, and said to her,<br/>`Yea, little maid, for am I not forgiven?'<br/>Then glancing up beheld the holy nuns<br/>All round her, weeping; and her heart was loosed<br/>Within her, and she wept with these and said,<br/><br/>`Ye know me then, that wicked one, who broke<br/>The vast design and purpose of the King.<br/>O shut me round with narrowing nunnery-walls,<br/>Meek maidens, from the voices crying "shame."<br/>I must not scorn myself: he loves me still.<br/>Let no one dream but that he loves me still.<br/>So let me, if you do not shudder at me,<br/>Nor shun to call me sister, dwell with you;<br/>Wear black and white, and be a nun like you,<br/>Fast with your fasts, not feasting with your feasts;<br/>Grieve with your griefs, not grieving at your joys,<br/>But not rejoicing; mingle with your rites;<br/>Pray and be prayed for; lie before your shrines;<br/>Do each low office of your holy house;<br/>Walk your dim cloister, and distribute dole<br/>To poor sick people, richer in His eyes<br/>Who ransomed us, and haler too than I;<br/>And treat their loathsome hurts and heal mine own;<br/>And so wear out in almsdeed and in prayer<br/>The sombre close of that voluptuous day,<br/>Which wrought the ruin of my lord the King.'<br/><br/>She said: they took her to themselves; and she<br/>Still hoping, fearing `is it yet too late?'<br/>Dwelt with them, till in time their Abbess died.<br/>Then she, for her good deeds and her pure life,<br/>And for the power of ministration in her,<br/>And likewise for the high rank she had borne,<br/>Was chosen Abbess, there, an Abbess, lived<br/>For three brief years, and there, an Abbess, past<br/>To where beyond these voices there is peace.
