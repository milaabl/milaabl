# üíÆ Epistle to Augusta by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
      My Sister! my sweet Sister! if a name<br/>  Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.<br/>  Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim<br/>  No tears, but tenderness to answer mine:<br/>  Go where I will, to me thou art the same--<br/>  A loved regret which I would not resign.<br/>  There yet are two things in my destiny,--<br/>A world to roam through, and a home with thee.<br/><br/>  The first were nothing--had I still the last,<br/>  It were the haven of my happiness;<br/>  But other claims and other ties thou hast,<br/>  And mine is not the wish to make them less.<br/>  A strange doom is thy father's son's, and past<br/>  Recalling, as it lies beyond redress;<br/>  Reversed for him our grandsire's fate of yore,--<br/>He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore.<br/><br/>  If my inheritance of storms hath been<br/>  In other elements, and on the rocks<br/>  Of perils, overlooked or unforeseen,<br/>  I have sustained my share of worldly shocks,<br/>  The fault was mine; nor do I seek to screen<br/>  My errors with defensive paradox;<br/>  I have been cunning in mine overthrow,<br/>The careful pilot of my proper woe.<br/><br/>  Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward.<br/>  My whole life was a contest, since the day<br/>  That gave me being, gave me that which marred<br/>  The gift,--a fate, or will, that walked astray;<br/>  And I at times have found the struggle hard,<br/>  And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay:<br/>  But now I fain would for a time survive,<br/>If but to see what next can well arrive.<br/><br/>  Kingdoms and Empires in my little day<br/>  I have outlived, and yet I am not old;<br/>  And when I look on this, the petty spray<br/>  Of my own years of trouble, which have rolled<br/>  Like a wild bay of breakers, melts away:<br/>  Something--I know not what--does still uphold<br/>  A spirit of slight patience;--not in vain,<br/>Even for its own sake, do we purchase Pain.<br/><br/>  Perhaps the workings of defiance stir<br/>  Within me--or, perhaps, a cold despair<br/>  Brought on when ills habitually recur,--<br/>  Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air,<br/>  (For even to this may change of soul refer,<br/>  And with light armour we may learn to bear,)<br/>  Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not<br/>The chief companion of a calmer lot.<br/><br/>  I feel almost at times as I have felt<br/>  In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks,<br/>  Which do remember me of where I dwelt,<br/>  Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books,<br/>  Come as of yore upon me, and can melt<br/>  My heart with recognition of their looks;<br/>  And even at moments I could think I see<br/>Some living thing to love--but none like thee.<br/><br/>  Here are the Alpine landscapes which create<br/>  A fund for contemplation;--to admire<br/>  Is a brief feeling of a trivial date;<br/>  But something worthier do such scenes inspire:<br/>  Here to be lonely is not desolate,<br/>  For much I view which I could most desire,<br/>  And, above all, a Lake I can behold<br/>Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old.<br/><br/>  Oh that thou wert but with me!--but I grow<br/>  The fool of my own wishes, and forget<br/>  The solitude which I have vaunted so<br/>  Has lost its praise in this but one regret;<br/>  There may be others which I less may show;--<br/>  I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet<br/>  I feel an ebb in my philosophy,<br/>And the tide rising in my altered eye.<br/><br/>  I did remind thee of our own dear Lake,<br/>  By the old Hall which may be mine no more.<br/>  _Leman's_ is fair; but think not I forsake<br/>  The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore:<br/>  Sad havoc Time must with my memory make,<br/>  Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before;<br/>  Though, like all things which I have loved, they are<br/>Resigned for ever, or divided far.<br/><br/>  The world is all before me; I but ask<br/>  Of Nature that with which she will comply--<br/>  It is but in her Summer's sun to bask,<br/>  To mingle with the quiet of her sky,<br/>  To see her gentle face without a mask,<br/>  And never gaze on it with apathy.<br/>  She was my early friend, and now shall be<br/>My sister--till I look again on thee.<br/><br/>  I can reduce all feelings but this one;<br/>  And that I would not;--for at length I see<br/>  Such scenes as those wherein my life begun--<br/>  The earliest--even the only paths for me--<br/>  Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun,<br/>  I had been better than I now can be;<br/>  The Passions which have torn me would have slept;<br/>_I_ had not suffered, and _thou_ hadst not wept.<br/><br/>  With false Ambition what had I to do?<br/>  Little with Love, and least of all with Fame;<br/>  And yet they came unsought, and with me grew,<br/>  And made me all which they can make--a Name.<br/>  Yet this was not the end I did pursue;<br/>  Surely I once beheld a nobler aim.<br/>  But all is over--I am one the more<br/>To baffled millions which have gone before.<br/><br/>  And for the future, this world's future may<br/>  From me demand but little of my care;<br/>  I have outlived myself by many a day;<br/>  Having survived so many things that were;<br/>  My years have been no slumber, but the prey<br/>  Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share<br/>  Of life which might have filled a century,<br/>Before its fourth in time had passed me by.<br/><br/>  And for the remnant which may be to come<br/>  I am content; and for the past I feel<br/>  Not thankless,--for within the crowded sum<br/>  Of struggles, Happiness at times would steal,<br/>  And for the present, I would not benumb<br/>  My feelings farther.--Nor shall I conceal<br/>  That with all this I still can look around,<br/>And worship Nature with a thought profound.<br/><br/>  For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart<br/>  I know myself secure, as thou in mine;<br/>  We were and are--I am, even as thou art--<br/>  Beings who ne'er each other can resign;<br/>  It is the same, together or apart,<br/>  From Life's commencement to its slow decline<br/>  We are entwined--let Death come slow or fast,<br/>The tie which bound the first endures the last!
