# üíÆ Religio Laici by *John Dryden*

<p>
    Dim, as the borrow'd beams of moon and stars<br/>To lonely, weary, wand'ring travellers,<br/>Is reason to the soul; and as on high,<br/>Those rolling fires discover but the sky<br/>Not light us here; so reason's glimmering ray<br/>Was lent not to assure our doubtful way,<br/>But guide us upward to a better day.<br/>And as those nightly tapers disappear<br/>When day's bright lord ascends our hemisphere<br/>So pale grows reason at religion's sight:<br/>So dies, and so dissolves in supernatural light.<br/>Some few, whose lamp shone brighter, have been led<br/>From cause to cause, to Nature's secret head;<br/>And found that one first principle must be:<br/>But what, or who, that Universal He;<br/>Whether some soul incompassing this ball<br/>Unmade, unmov'd; yet making, moving all;<br/>Or various atoms' interfering dance<br/>Leapt into form (the noble work of chance;)<br/>Or this great all was from eternity;<br/>Not even the Stagirite himself could see;<br/>And Epicurus guess'd as well as he:<br/>As blindly grop'd they for a future state;<br/>As rashly judg'd of Providence and Fate:<br/>But least of all could their endeavours find<br/>What most concern'd the good of human kind.<br/>For happiness was never to be found;<br/>But vanish'd from 'em, like enchanted ground.<br/>One thought content the good to be enjoy'd:<br/>This, every little accident destroy'd:<br/>The wiser madmen did for virtue toil:<br/>A thorny, or at best a barren soil:<br/>In pleasure some their glutton souls would steep;<br/>But found their line too short, the well too deep;<br/>And leaky vessels which no bliss could keep.<br/>Thus anxious thoughts in endless circles roll,<br/>Without a centre where to fix the soul:<br/>In this wild maze their vain endeavours end:<br/>How can the less the greater comprehend?<br/>Or finite reason reach infinity?<br/>For what could fathom God were more than He.<br/><br/>  The Deist thinks he stands on firmer ground;<br/>Cries [lang g]eur{-e}ka[lang e] the mighty secret's found:<br/>God is that spring of good; supreme, and best;<br/>We, made to serve, and in that service blest;<br/>If so, some rules of worship must be given;<br/>Distributed alike to all by Heaven:<br/>Else God were partial, and to some deny'd<br/>The means his justice should for all provide.<br/>This general worship is to PRAISE, and PRAY:<br/>One part to borrow blessings, one to pay:<br/>And when frail Nature slides into offence,<br/>The sacrifice for crimes is penitence.<br/>Yet, since th'effects of providence, we find<br/>Are variously dispens'd to human kind;<br/>That vice triumphs, and virtue suffers here,<br/>(A brand that sovereign justice cannot bear;)<br/>Our reason prompts us to a future state:<br/>The last appeal from fortune, and from fate:<br/>Where God's all-righteous ways will be declar'd;<br/>The bad meet punishment, the good, reward.<br/><br/>  Thus man by his own strength to Heaven would soar:<br/>And would not be oblig'd to God for more.<br/>Vain, wretched creature, how art thou misled<br/>To think thy wit these god-like notions bred!<br/>These truths are not the product of thy mind,<br/>But dropt from Heaven, and of a nobler kind.<br/>Reveal'd religion first inform'd thy sight,<br/>And reason saw not, till faith sprung the light.<br/>Hence all thy natural worship takes the source:<br/>'Tis revelation what thou think'st discourse.<br/>Else how com'st thou to see these truths so clear,<br/>Which so obscure to heathens did appear?<br/>Not Plato these, nor Aristotle found:<br/>Nor he whose wisdom oracles renown'd.<br/>Hast thou a wit so deep, or so sublime,<br/>Or canst thou lower dive, or higher climb?<br/>Canst thou, by reason, more of God-head know<br/>Than Plutarch, Seneca, or Cicero?<br/>Those giant wits, in happier ages born,<br/>(When arms, and arts did Greece and Rome adorn)<br/>Knew no such system; no such piles could raise<br/>Of natural worship, built on pray'r and praise,<br/>To one sole God.<br/>Nor did remorse, to expiate sin, prescribe:<br/>But slew their fellow creatures for a bribe:<br/>The guiltless victim groan'd for their offence;<br/>And cruelty, and blood was penitence.<br/>If sheep and oxen could atone for men<br/>Ah! at how cheap a rate the rich might sin!<br/>And great oppressors might Heaven's wrath beguile<br/>By offering his own creatures for a spoil!<br/><br/>  Dar'st thou, poor worm, offend Infinity?<br/>And must the terms of peace be given by thee?<br/>Then thou art justice in the last appeal;<br/>Thy easy God instructs thee to rebel:<br/>And, like a king remote, and weak, must take<br/>What satisfaction thou art pleas'd to make.<br/><br/>  But if there be a pow'r too just, and strong<br/>To wink at crimes, and bear unpunish'd wrong;<br/>Look humbly upward, see his will disclose<br/>The forfeit first, and then the fine impose:<br/>A mulct thy poverty could never pay<br/>Had not Eternal Wisdom found the way:<br/>And with celestial wealth supply'd thy store:<br/>His justice makes the fine, his mercy quits the score.<br/>See God descending in thy human frame;<br/>Th'offended, suff'ring in th'offender's name:<br/>All thy misdeeds to him imputed see;<br/>And all his righteousness devolv'd on thee.<br/><br/>For granting we have sinn'd, and that th'offence<br/>Of man, is made against omnipotence,<br/>Some price, that bears proportion, must be paid;<br/>And infinite with infinite be weigh'd.<br/>See then the Deist lost: remorse for vice,<br/>Not paid, or paid, inadequate in price:<br/>What farther means can reason now direct,<br/>Or what relief from human wit expect?<br/>That shows us sick; and sadly are we sure<br/>Still to be sick, till Heav'n reveal the cure:<br/>If then Heaven's will must needs be understood,<br/>(Which must, if we want cure, and Heaven be good)<br/>Let all records of will reveal'd be shown;<br/>With Scripture, all in equal balance thrown,<br/>And our one sacred Book will be that one.<br/><br/>Proof needs not here, for whether we compare<br/>That impious, idle, superstitious ware<br/>Of rites, lustrations, offerings, (which before,<br/>In various ages, various countries bore)<br/>With Christian faith and virtues, we shall find<br/>None answ'ring the great ends of human kind,<br/>But this one rule of life: that shows us best<br/>How God may be appeas'd, and mortals blest.<br/>Whether from length of time its worth we draw,<br/>The world is scarce more ancient than the law:<br/>Heav'n's early care prescrib'd for every age;<br/>First, in the soul, and after, in the page.<br/>Or, whether more abstractedly we look,<br/>Or on the writers, or the written Book,<br/>Whence, but from Heav'n, could men unskill'd in arts,<br/>In several ages born, in several parts,<br/>Weave such agreeing truths? or how, or why<br/>Should all conspire to cheat us with a lie?<br/>Unask'd their pains, ungrateful their advice,<br/>Starving their gain, and martyrdom their price.<br/><br/>If on the Book itself we cast our view,<br/>Concurrent heathens prove the story true:<br/>The doctrine, miracles; which must convince,<br/>For Heav'n in them appeals to human sense:<br/>And though they prove not, they confirm the cause,<br/>When what is taught agrees with Nature's laws.<br/><br/>Then for the style; majestic and divine,<br/>It speaks no less than God in every line:<br/>Commanding words; whose force is still the same<br/>As the first fiat that produc'd our frame.<br/>All faiths beside, or did by arms ascend;<br/>Or sense indulg'd has made mankind their friend:<br/>This only doctrine does our lusts oppose:<br/>Unfed by Nature's soil, in which it grows;<br/>Cross to our interests, curbing sense, and sin;<br/>Oppress'd without, and undermin'd within,<br/>It thrives through pain; its own tormentors tires;<br/>And with a stubborn patience still aspires.<br/>To what can reason such effects assign,<br/>Transcending Nature, but to laws divine:<br/>Which in that sacred volume are contain'd;<br/>Sufficient, clear, and for that use ordain'd.<br/><br/>But stay: the Deist here will urge anew,<br/>No supernatural worship can be true:<br/>Because a general law is that alone<br/>Which must to all, and everywhere be known:<br/>A style so large as not this Book can claim<br/>Nor aught that bears reveal'd religion's name.<br/>'Tis said the sound of a Messiah's Birth<br/>Is gone through all the habitable earth:<br/>But still that text must be confin'd alone<br/>To what was then inhabited, and known:<br/>And what Provision could from thence accrue<br/>To Indian souls, and worlds discover'd new?<br/>In other parts it helps, that ages past,<br/>The Scriptures there were known, and were embrac'd,<br/>Till sin spread once again the shades of night:<br/>What's that to these who never saw the light?<br/><br/>Of all objections this indeed is chief<br/>To startle reason, stagger frail belief:<br/>We grant, 'tis true, that Heav'n from human sense<br/>Has hid the secret paths of Providence:<br/>But boundless wisdom, boundless mercy, may<br/>Find ev'n for those bewilder'd souls, a way:<br/>If from his nature foes may pity claim,<br/>Much more may strangers who ne'er heard his name.<br/>And though no name be for salvation known,<br/>But that of his eternal Son's alone;<br/>Who knows how far transcending goodness can<br/>Extend the merits of that Son to man?<br/>Who knows what reasons may his mercy lead;<br/>Or ignorance invincible may plead?<br/>Not only charity bids hope the best,<br/>But more the great Apostle has expressed.<br/>That, if the Gentiles (whom no law inspir'd,)<br/>By nature did what was by law requir'd;<br/>They, who the written rule had never known,<br/>Were to themselves both rule and law alone:<br/>To nature's plain indictment they shall plead;<br/>And, by their conscience, be condemn'd or freed.<br/>Most righteous doom! because a rule reveal'd<br/>Is none to those, from whom it was conceal'd.<br/>Then those who follow'd reason's dictates right;<br/>Liv'd up, and lifted high their natural light;<br/>With Socrates may see their Maker's Face,<br/>While thousand rubric-martyrs want a place.<br/><br/>Nor does it baulk my charity, to find<br/>Th'Egyptian Bishop of another mind:<br/>For, though his Creed eternal truth contains,<br/>'Tis hard for man to doom to endless pains<br/>All who believ'd not all, his zeal requir'd,<br/>Unless he first could prove he was inspir'd.<br/>Then let us either think he meant to say<br/>This faith, where publish'd, was the only way;<br/>Or else conclude that, Arius to confute,<br/>The good old man, too eager in dispute,<br/>Flew high; and as his Christian fury rose<br/>Damn'd all for heretics who durst oppose.<br/><br/>Thus far my charity this path has tried;<br/>(A much unskilful, but well meaning guide:)<br/>Yet what they are, ev'n these crude thoughts were bred<br/>By reading that, which better thou hast read,<br/>Thy matchless Author's work: which thou, my friend,<br/>By well translating better dost commend:<br/>Those youthful hours which, of thy equals most<br/>In toys have squander'd, or in vice have lost,<br/>Those hours hast thou to nobler use employ'd;<br/>And the severe delights of truth enjoyed.<br/>Witness this weighty book, in which appears<br/>The crabbed toil of many thoughtful years,<br/>Spent by thy author in the sifting care<br/>Of rabbins' old sophisticated ware<br/>From gold divine; which he who well can sort<br/>May afterwards make algebra a sport.<br/>A treasure, which if country-curates buy,<br/>They Junius and Tremellius may defy:<br/>Save pains in various readings, and translations;<br/>And without Hebrew make most learn'd quotations.<br/>A work so full with various learning fraught,<br/>So nicely ponder'd, yet so strongly wrought,<br/>As nature's height and art's last hand requir'd:<br/>As much as man could compass, uninspir'd.<br/>Where we may see what errors have been made<br/>Both in the copier's and translator's trade:<br/>How Jewish, Popish, interests have prevail'd,<br/>And where infallibility has fail'd.<br/><br/>For some, who have his secret meaning guess'd,<br/>Have found our author not too much a priest:<br/>For fashion-sake he seems to have recourse<br/>To Pope, and Councils, and tradition's force:<br/>But he that old traditions could subdue,<br/>Could not but find the weakness of the new:<br/>If Scripture, though deriv'd from Heavenly birth,<br/>Has been but carelessly preserv'd on earth;<br/>If God's own people, who of God before<br/>Knew what we know, and had been promis'd more,<br/>In fuller terms, of Heaven's assisting care,<br/>And who did neither time, nor study spare<br/>To keep this Book untainted, unperplex'd;<br/>Let in gross errors to corrupt the text:<br/>Omitted paragraphs, embroil'd the sense;<br/>With vain traditions stopp'd the gaping fence,<br/>Which every common hand pull'd up with ease:<br/>What safety from such brushwood-helps as these?<br/>If written words from time are not secur'd,<br/>How can we think have oral sounds endur'd?<br/>Which thus transmitted, if one mouth has fail'd,<br/>Immortal lies on ages are entail'd:<br/>And that some such have been, is prov'd too plain;<br/>If we consider interest, church, and gain.<br/><br/>Oh but says one, tradition set aside,<br/>Where can we hope for an unerring guide?<br/>For since th' original Scripture has been lost,<br/>All copies disagreeing, maim'd the most,<br/>Or Christian faith can have no certain ground,<br/>Or truth in Church tradition must be found.<br/><br/>Such an omniscient church we wish indeed;<br/>'Twere worth both Testaments, and cast in the Creed:<br/>But if this Mother be a guide so sure,<br/>As can all doubts resolve, all truth secure;<br/>Then her infallibility, as well<br/>Where copies are corrupt, or lame, can tell?<br/>Restore lost Canon with as little pains,<br/>As truly explicate what still remains:<br/>Which yet no Council dare pretend to do;<br/>Unless like Esdras, they could write it new:<br/>Strange confidence, still to interpret true,<br/>Yet not be sure that all they have explain'd,<br/>Is in the blest Original contain'd.<br/>More safe, and much more modest 'tis, to say<br/>God would not leave mankind without a way:<br/>And that the Scriptures, though not everywhere<br/>Free from corruption, or entire, or clear,<br/>Are uncorrupt, sufficient, clear, entire,<br/>In all things which our needful faith require.<br/>If others in the same glass better see<br/>'Tis for themselves they look, but not for me:<br/>For my salvation must its doom receive<br/>Not from what others , but what I believe.<br/><br/>Must all tradition then be set aside?<br/>This to affirm were ignorance, or pride.<br/>Are there not many points, some needful sure<br/>To saving faith, that Scripture leaves obscure?<br/>Which every sect will wrest a several way<br/>(For what one sect interprets, all sects may:)<br/>We hold, and say we prove from Scripture plain,<br/>That Christ is God ; the bold Socinian<br/>From the same Scripture urges he's but man .<br/>Now what appeal can end th'important suit;<br/>Both parts talk loudly, but the Rule is mute?<br/><br/>Shall I speak plain, and in a nation free<br/>Assume an honest layman's liberty?<br/>I think (according to my little skill,<br/>To my own Mother-Church submitting still)<br/>That many have been sav'd, and many may,<br/>Who never heard this question brought in play.<br/>Th' unletter'd Christian, who believes in gross,<br/>Plods on to Heaven; and ne'er is at a loss:<br/>For the Strait-gate would be made straiter yet,<br/>Were none admitted there but men of wit.<br/>The few, by nature form'd, with learning fraught,<br/>Born to instruct, as others to be taught,<br/>Must study well the sacred page; and see<br/>Which doctrine, this, or that, does best agree<br/>With the whole tenor of the Work divine:<br/>And plainliest points to Heaven's reveal'd design:<br/>Which exposition flows from genuine sense;<br/>And which is forc'd by wit and eloquence.<br/>Not that tradition's parts are useless here:<br/>When general, old, disinteress'd and clear:<br/>That ancient Fathers thus expound the page,<br/>Gives truth the reverend majesty of age:<br/>Confirms its force, by biding every test;<br/>For best authority's next Rules are best.<br/>And still the nearer to the Spring we go<br/>More limpid, more unsoil'd the waters flow.<br/>Thus, first traditions were a proof alone;<br/>Could we be certain such they were, so known:<br/>But since some flaws in long descent may be,<br/>They make not truth but probability.<br/>Even Arius and Pelagius durst provoke<br/>To what the centuries preceding spoke.<br/>Such difference is there in an oft-told tale:<br/>But truth by its own sinews will prevail.<br/>Tradition written therefore more commends<br/>Authority, than what from voice descends:<br/>And this, as perfect as its kind can be,<br/>Rolls down to us the Sacred History:<br/>Which, from the Universal Church receiv'd,<br/>Is tried, and after, for its self believ'd.<br/><br/>The partial Papists would infer from hence<br/>Their church, in last resort, should judge the sense.<br/>But first they would assume, with wondrous art,<br/>Themselves to be the whole, who are but part<br/>Of that vast frame, the Church; yet grant they were<br/>The handers down, can they from thence infer<br/>A right t'interpret? or would they alone<br/>Who brought the present, claim it for their own?<br/>The Book's a common largess to mankind;<br/>Not more for them, than every man design'd:<br/>The welcome news is in the letter found;<br/>The carrier's not commission'd to expound.<br/>It speaks itself, and what it does contain,<br/>In all things needful to be known, is plain.<br/><br/>In times o'ergrown with rust and ignorance,<br/>A gainful trade their clergy did advance:<br/>When want of learning kept the laymen low,<br/>And none but priests were authoriz'd to know:<br/>When what small knowledge was, in them did dwell;<br/>And he a God who could but read or spell;<br/>Then Mother Church did mightily prevail:<br/>She parcell'd out the Bible by retail:<br/>But still expounded what she sold or gave;<br/>To keep it in her power to damn and save:<br/>Scripture was scarce, and as the market went,<br/>Poor laymen took salvation on content;<br/>As needy men take money, good or bad:<br/>God's Word they had not, but the priests they had.<br/>Yet, whate'er false conveyances they made,<br/>The lawyer still was certain to be paid.<br/>In those dark times they learn'd their knack so well.<br/>That by long use they grew infallible:<br/>At last, a knowing age began t'enquire<br/>If they the Book, or that did them inspire:<br/>And, making narrower search they found, though late,<br/>That what they thought the priest's was their estate:<br/>Taught by the will produc'd, (the written Word)<br/>How long they had been cheated on record.<br/>Then, every man who saw the title fair,<br/>Claim'd a child's part, and put in for a share:<br/>Consulted soberly his private good;<br/>And sav'd himself as cheap as e'er he could.<br/><br/>'Tis true, my friend, (and far be flattery hence)<br/>This good had full as bad a consequence:<br/>The Book thus put in every vulgar hand,<br/>Which each presum'd he best could understand,<br/>The common rule was made the common prey;<br/>And at the mercy of the rabble lay.<br/>The tender page with horny fists was gall'd;<br/>And he was gifted most that loudest bawl'd:<br/>The spirit gave the doctoral degree:<br/>And every member of a company<br/>Was of his trade, and of the Bible free.<br/>Plain truths enough for needful use they found;<br/>But men would still be itching to expound:<br/>Each was ambitious of th'obscurest place,<br/>No measure ta'en from knowledge, all from grace .<br/>Study and pains were now no more their care:<br/>Texts were explain'd by fasting, and by prayer:<br/>This was the fruit the private spirit brought;<br/>Occasion'd by great zeal, and little thought.<br/>While crowds unlearn'd, with rude devotion warm,<br/>About the sacred viands buzz and swarm,<br/>The fly-blown text creates a crawling brood;<br/>And turns to maggots what was meant for food.<br/>A thousand daily sects rise up, and die;<br/>A thousand more the perish'd race supply:<br/>So all we make of Heaven's discover'd Will<br/>Is, not to have it, or to use it ill.<br/>The danger's much the same; on several shelves<br/>If others wreck us, or we wreck ourselves.<br/><br/>What then remains, but, waving each extreme,<br/>The tides of ignorance, and pride to stem?<br/>Neither so rich a treasure to forego;<br/>Nor proudly seek beyond our pow'r to know:<br/>Faith is not built on disquisitions vain;<br/>The things we must believe, are few, and plain:<br/>But since men will believe more than they need;<br/>And every man will make himself a creed:<br/>In doubtful questions 'tis the safest way<br/>To learn what unsuspected ancients say:<br/>For 'tis not likely we should higher soar<br/>In search of Heav'n, than all the Church before:<br/>Nor can we be deceiv'd, unless we see<br/>The Scripture, and the Fathers disagree.<br/>If after all, they stand suspected still,<br/>(For no man's faith depends upon his will;)<br/>'Tis some relief, that points not clearly known,<br/>Without much hazard may be let alone:<br/>And, after hearing what our Church can say,<br/>If still our reason runs another way,<br/>That private reason 'tis more just to curb,<br/>Than by disputes the public peace disturb:<br/>For points obscure are of small use to learn:<br/>But common quiet is mankind's concern.<br/><br/>Thus have I made my own opinions clear:<br/>Yet neither praise expect, nor censure fear:<br/>And this unpolish'd, rugged verse, I chose;<br/>As fittest for discourse, and nearest prose:<br/>For, while from sacred truth I do not swerve,<br/>Tom Sternhold's, or Tom Shadwell's rhymes will serve.
