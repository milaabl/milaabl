# üíÆ Jubilate Agno: Fragment B, Part 3 by *Christopher Smart*

<p>
    For a Man is to be looked upon in that which he excells as on a prospect.<br/><br/>For there be twelve cardinal virtues -- three to the East -- Greatness, Valour, Piety.<br/><br/>For there be three to the West -- Goodness, Purity and Sublimity.<br/><br/>For there be three to the North -- Meditation, Happiness, Strength.<br/><br/>For there be three to the South -- Constancy, Pleasantry and Wisdom.<br/><br/>For the Argument A PRIORI is GOD in every man's CONSCIENCE.<br/><br/>For the Argument A POSTERIORI is God before every man's eyes.<br/><br/>For the Four and Twenty Elders of the Revelation are Four and Twenty Eternities.<br/><br/>For their Four and Twenty Crowns are their respective Consummations.<br/><br/>For a CHARACTER is the votes of the Worldlings, but the seal is of Almighty GOD alone.<br/><br/>For there is no musick in flats and sharps which are not in God's natural key.<br/><br/>For where Accusation takes the place of encouragement a man of Genius is driven to act the vices of a fool.<br/><br/>For the Devil can set a house on fire, when the inhabitants find combustibles.<br/><br/>For the old account of time is the true -- Decr 28th 1759-60 -- -- --<br/><br/>For Faith as a grain of mustard seed is to believe, as I do, that an Eternity is such in respect to the power and magnitude of Almighty God.<br/><br/>For a DREAM is a good thing from GOD.<br/><br/>For there is a dream from the adversary which is terror.<br/><br/>For the phenomenon of dreaming is not of one solution, but many.<br/><br/>For Eternity is like a grain of mustard as a growing body and improving spirit.<br/><br/>For the malignancy of fire is oweing to the Devil's hiding of light, till it became visible darkness.<br/><br/>For the Circle may be SQUARED by swelling and flattening.<br/><br/>For the Life of God is in the body of man and his spirit in the Soul.<br/><br/>For there was no rain in Paradise because of the delicate construction of the spiritual herbs and flowers.<br/><br/>For the Planet Mercury is the WORD DISCERNMENT.<br/><br/>For the Scotchman seeks for truth at the bottom of a well, the Englishman in the Heavn of Heavens.<br/><br/>For the Planet Venus is the WORD PRUDENCE or providence.<br/><br/>For GOD nevertheless is an extravagant BEING and generous unto loss.<br/><br/>For there is no profit in the generation of man and the loss of millions is not worth God's tear.<br/><br/>For this is the twelfth day of the MILLENNIUM of the MILLENNIUM foretold by the prophets -- give the glory to God ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY --<br/><br/>For the Planet Mars is the word FORTITUDE.<br/><br/>For to worship naked in the Rain is the bravest thing for the refreshing and purifying the body.<br/><br/>For the Planet Jupiter is the WORD DISPENSATION.<br/><br/>For Tully says to be generous you must be first just, but the voice of Christ is distribute at all events.<br/><br/>For Kittim is the father of the Pygmies, God be gracious to Pigg his family.<br/><br/>For the Soul is divisible and a portion of the Spirit may be cut off from one and applied to another.<br/><br/>For NEW BREAD is the most wholesome especially if it be leaven'd with honey.<br/><br/>For a NEW SONG also is best, if it be to the glory of God; and taken with the food like the psalms.<br/><br/>For the Planet Saturn is the word TEMPERANCE or PATIENCE.<br/><br/>For Jacob's Ladder are the steps of the Earth graduated hence to Paradice and thence to the throne of God.<br/><br/>For a good wish is well but a faithful prayer is an eternal benefit.<br/><br/>For SPICA VIRGINIS is the star that appeared to the wise men in the East and directed their way before it was yet insphered.<br/><br/>For an IDEA is the mental vision of an object.<br/><br/>For Lock supposes that an human creature, at a given time may be an atheist i.e. without God, by the folly of his doctrine concerning innate ideas.<br/><br/>For it is not lawful to sell poyson in England any more than it is in Venice, the Lord restrain both the finder and receiver.<br/><br/>For the ACCENTS are the invention of the Moabites, who learning the GREEK tongue marked the words after their own vicious pronuntiation.<br/><br/>For the GAULS (the now-French and original Moabites) after they were subdued by C√¶sar became such Grecians at Rome.<br/><br/>For the Gaullic manuscripts fell into the hands of the inventors of printing.<br/><br/>For all the inventions of man, which are good, are the communications of Almighty God.<br/><br/>For all the stars have satellites, which are terms under their respective words.<br/><br/>For tiger is a word and his satellites are Griffin, Storgis, Cat and others.<br/><br/>For my talent is to give an Impression upon words by punching, that when the reader casts his eye upon 'em, he takes up the image from the mould which I have made.<br/><br/>For JOB was the son of Issachar and patience is the child of strength.<br/><br/>For the Names of the DAYS, as they now stand, are foolish and abominable.<br/><br/>For the Days are the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh.<br/><br/>For the names of the months are false -- the Hebrew appellatives are of God.<br/><br/>For the Time of the Lord's temptation was in early youth and imminent danger.<br/><br/>For an equivocal generation is a generation and no generation.<br/><br/>For putrifying matter nevertheless will yield up its life in diverse creatures and combinations of creatures.<br/><br/>For a TOAD can dwell in the centre of a stone, because -- there are stones whose constituent life is of those creatures.<br/><br/>For a Toad hath by means of his eye the most beautiful prospects of any other animal to make him amends for his distance from his Creator in Glory.<br/><br/>For FAT is the fruit of benevolence, therefore it was the Lord's in the Mosaic sacrifices.<br/><br/>For the very particular laws of Moses are the determinations of CASES that fell under his cognizance.<br/><br/>For the Devil can make the shadow thicker by candlelight by reason of his pow'r over malignant fire.<br/><br/>For the Romans clipped their words in the Augustan thro idleness and effeminacy and paid foreign actors for speaking them out.<br/><br/>For when the weight and the pow'r are equivalent the prop is of none effect.<br/><br/>For shaving of the beard was an invention of the people of Sodom to make men look like women.<br/><br/>For the ends of the world are the accomplishment of great events, and the consummation of periods.<br/><br/>For ignorance is a sin because illumination is to be obtained by prayer.<br/><br/>For Preferment is not from the East, West or South, but from the North, where Satan has most power.<br/><br/>For the ministers of the Devil set the hewer of wood over the head of God's free Man.<br/><br/>For this inverting God's good order, edifice and edification, and appointing place, where the Lord has not appointed.<br/><br/>For the Ethiopian question is already solved in that the Blacks are the children of Cain.<br/><br/>For the phenomenon of the horizontal moon is the truth -- she appears bigger in the horizon because she actually is so.<br/><br/>For it was said of old 'can the Ethiopian change his skin?' the Lord has answered the question by his merit and death he shall. --<br/><br/>For the moon is magnified in the horizon by Almighty God, and so is the Sun.<br/><br/>For she has done her day's-work and the blessing of God upon her, and she communicates with the earth.<br/><br/>For when she rises she has been strength'ned by the Sun, who cherishes her by night.<br/><br/>For man is born to trouble in the body, as the sparks fly upwards in the spirit.<br/><br/>For man is between the pinchers while his soul is shaping and purifying.<br/><br/>For the ENGLISH are the seed of Abraham and work up to him by Joab, David, and Naphtali.
