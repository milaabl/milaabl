  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Ugolino by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    INFERNO 33, 22-75.<br/><br/>Now had the loophole of that dungeon, still<br/>Which bears the name of Famine's Tower from me,<br/>And where 'tis fit that many another will<br/><br/>Be doomed to linger in captivity,<br/>Shown through its narrow opening in my cell<br/>'Moon after moon slow waning', when a sleep,<br/><br/>'That of the future burst the veil, in dream<br/>Visited me. It was a slumber deep<br/>And evil; for I saw, or I did seem'<br/><br/>To see, 'that' tyrant Lord his revels keep<br/>The leader of the cruel hunt to them,<br/>Chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs up the steep<br/><br/>Ascent, that from 'the Pisan is the screen'<br/>Of 'Lucca'; with him Gualandi came,<br/>Sismondi, and Lanfranchi, 'bloodhounds lean,<br/><br/>Trained to the sport and eager for the game<br/>Wide ranging in his front;' but soon were seen<br/>Though by so short a course, with 'spirits tame,'<br/><br/>The father and 'his whelps' to flag at once,<br/>And then the sharp fangs gored their bosoms deep.<br/>Ere morn I roused myself, and heard my sons,<br/><br/>For they were with me, moaning in their sleep,<br/>And begging bread. Ah, for those darling ones!<br/>Right cruel art thou, if thou dost not weep<br/><br/>In thinking of my soul's sad augury;<br/>And if thou weepest not now, weep never more!<br/>They were already waked, as wont drew nigh<br/><br/>The allotted hour for food, and in that hour<br/>Each drew a presage from his dream. When I<br/>'Heard locked beneath me of that horrible tower<br/><br/>The outlet; then into their eyes alone<br/>I looked to read myself,' without a sign<br/>Or word. I wept not--turned within to stone.<br/><br/>They wept aloud, and little Anselm mine,<br/>Said--'twas my youngest, dearest little one,--<br/>"What ails thee, father? Why look so at thine?"<br/><br/>In all that day, and all the following night,<br/>I wept not, nor replied; but when to shine<br/>Upon the world, not us, came forth the light<br/><br/>Of the new sun, and thwart my prison thrown<br/>Gleamed through its narrow chink, a doleful sight,<br/>'Three faces, each the reflex of my own,<br/><br/>Were imaged by its faint and ghastly ray;'<br/>Then I, of either hand unto the bone,<br/>Gnawed, in my agony; and thinking they<br/><br/>Twas done from sudden pangs, in their excess,<br/>All of a sudden raise themselves, and say,<br/>"Father! our woes, so great, were yet the less<br/><br/>Would you but eat of us,--twas 'you who clad<br/>Our bodies in these weeds of wretchedness;<br/>Despoil them'." Not to make their hearts more sad,<br/><br/>I 'hushed' myself. That day is at its close,--<br/>Another--still we were all mute. Oh, had<br/>The obdurate earth opened to end our woes!<br/><br/>The fourth day dawned, and when the new sun shone,<br/>Outstretched himself before me as it rose<br/>My Gaddo, saying, "Help, father! hast thou none<br/><br/>For thine own child--is there no help from thee?"<br/>He died--there at my feet--and one by one,<br/>I saw them fall, plainly as you see me.<br/><br/>Between the fifth and sixth day, ere twas dawn,<br/>I found 'myself blind-groping o'er the three.'<br/>Three days I called them after they were gone.<br/><br/>Famine of grief can get the mastery.
