# üíÆ Lines Written Among the Euganean Hills by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    OCTOBER, 1818.<br/><br/>Many a green isle needs must be<br/>In the deep wide sea of Misery,<br/>Or the mariner, worn and wan,<br/>Never thus could voyage on--<br/>Day and night, and night and day,<br/>Drifting on his dreary way,<br/>With the solid darkness black<br/>Closing round his vessel's track:<br/>Whilst above the sunless sky,<br/>Big with clouds, hangs heavily,<br/>And behind the tempest fleet<br/>Hurries on with lightning feet,<br/>Riving sail, and cord, and plank,<br/>Till the ship has almost drank<br/>Death from the o'er-brimming deep;<br/>And sinks down, down, like that sleep<br/>When the dreamer seems to be<br/>Weltering through eternity;<br/>And the dim low line before<br/>Of a dark and distant shore<br/>Still recedes, as ever still<br/>Longing with divided will,<br/>But no power to seek or shun,<br/>He is ever drifted on<br/>O'er the unreposing wave<br/>To the haven of the grave.<br/>What, if there no friends will greet;<br/>What, if there no heart will meet<br/>His with love's impatient beat;<br/>Wander wheresoe'er he may,<br/>Can he dream before that day<br/>To find refuge from distress<br/>In friendship's smile, in love's caress?<br/>Then 'twill wreak him little woe<br/>Whether such there be or no:<br/>Senseless is the breast, and cold,<br/>Which relenting love would fold;<br/>Bloodless are the veins and chill<br/>Which the pulse of pain did fill;<br/>Every little living nerve<br/>That from bitter words did swerve<br/>Round the tortured lips and brow,<br/>Are like sapless leaflets now<br/>Frozen upon December's bough.<br/><br/>On the beach of a northern sea<br/>Which tempests shake eternally,<br/>As once the wretch there lay to sleep,<br/>Lies a solitary heap,<br/>One white skull and seven dry bones,<br/>On the margin of the stones,<br/>Where a few gray rushes stand,<br/>Boundaries of the sea and land:<br/>Nor is heard one voice of wail<br/>But the sea-mews, as they sail<br/>O'er the billows of the gale;<br/>Or the whirlwind up and down<br/>Howling, like a slaughtered town,<br/>When a king in glory rides<br/>Through the pomp of fratricides:<br/>Those unburied bones around<br/>There is many a mournful sound;<br/>There is no lament for him,<br/>Like a sunless vapour, dim,<br/>Who once clothed with life and thought<br/>What now moves nor murmurs not.<br/><br/>Ay, many flowering islands lie<br/>In the waters of wide Agony:<br/>To such a one this morn was led,<br/>My bark by soft winds piloted:<br/>'Mid the mountains Euganean<br/>I stood listening to the paean<br/>With which the legioned rooks did hail<br/>The sun's uprise majestical;<br/>Gathering round with wings all hoar,<br/>Through the dewy mist they soar<br/>Like gray shades, till the eastern heaven<br/>Bursts, and then, as clouds of even,<br/>Flecked with fire and azure, lie<br/>In the unfathomable sky,<br/>So their plumes of purple grain,<br/>Starred with drops of golden rain,<br/>Gleam above the sunlight woods,<br/>As in silent multitudes<br/>On the morning's fitful gale<br/>Through the broken mist they sail,<br/>And the vapours cloven and gleaming<br/>Follow, down the dark steep streaming,<br/>Till all is bright, and clear, and still,<br/>Round the solitary hill.<br/><br/>Beneath is spread like a green sea<br/>The waveless plain of Lombardy,<br/>Bounded by the vaporous air,<br/>Islanded by cities fair;<br/>Underneath Day's azure eyes<br/>Ocean's nursling, Venice lies,<br/>A peopled labyrinth of walls,<br/>Amphitrite's destined halls,<br/>Which her hoary sire now paves<br/>With his blue and beaming waves.<br/>Lo! the sun upsprings behind,<br/>Broad, red, radiant, half-reclined<br/>On the level quivering line<br/>Of the waters crystalline;<br/>And before that chasm of light,<br/>As within a furnace bright,<br/>Column, tower, and dome, and spire,<br/>Shine like obelisks of fire,<br/>Pointing with inconstant motion<br/>From the altar of dark ocean<br/>To the sapphire-tinted skies;<br/>As the flames of sacrifice<br/>From the marble shrines did rise,<br/>As to pierce the dome of gold<br/>Where Apollo spoke of old.<br/><br/>Sun-girt City, thou hast been<br/>Ocean's child, and then his queen;<br/>Now is come a darker day,<br/>And thou soon must be his prey,<br/>If the power that raised thee here<br/>Hallow so thy watery bier.<br/>A less drear ruin then than now,<br/>With thy conquest-branded brow<br/>Stooping to the slave of slaves<br/>From thy throne, among the waves<br/>Wilt thou be, when the sea-mew<br/>Flies, as once before it flew,<br/>O'er thine isles depopulate,<br/>And all is in its ancient state,<br/>Save where many a palace gate<br/>With green sea-flowers overgrown<br/>Like a rock of Ocean's own,<br/>Topples o'er the abandoned sea<br/>As the tides change sullenly.<br/>The fisher on his watery way,<br/>Wandering at the close of day,<br/>Will spread his sail and seize his oar<br/>Till he pass the gloomy shore,<br/>Lest thy dead should, from their sleep<br/>Bursting o'er the starlight deep,<br/>Lead a rapid masque of death<br/>O'er the waters of his path.<br/><br/>Those who alone thy towers behold<br/>Quivering through aereal gold,<br/>As I now behold them here,<br/>Would imagine not they were<br/>Sepulchres, where human forms,<br/>Like pollution-nourished worms,<br/>To the corpse of greatness cling,<br/>Murdered, and now mouldering:<br/>But if Freedom should awake<br/>In her omnipotence, and shake<br/>From the Celtic Anarch's hold<br/>All the keys of dungeons cold,<br/>Where a hundred cities lie<br/>Chained like thee, ingloriously,<br/>Thou and all thy sister band<br/>Might adorn this sunny land,<br/>Twining memories of old time<br/>With new virtues more sublime;<br/>If not, perish thou and they!--<br/>Clouds which stain truth's rising day<br/>By her sun consumed away--<br/>Earth can spare ye: while like flowers,<br/>In the waste of years and hours,<br/>From your dust new nations spring<br/>With more kindly blossoming.<br/><br/>Perish--let there only be<br/>Floating o'er thy hearthless sea<br/>As the garment of thy sky<br/>Clothes the world immortally,<br/>One remembrance, more sublime<br/>Than the tattered pall of time,<br/>Which scarce hides thy visage wan;--<br/>That a tempest-cleaving Swan<br/>Of the songs of Albion,<br/>Driven from his ancestral streams<br/>By the might of evil dreams,<br/>Found a nest in thee; and Ocean<br/>Welcomed him with such emotion<br/>That its joy grew his, and sprung<br/>From his lips like music flung<br/>O'er a mighty thunder-fit,<br/>Chastening terror:--what though yet<br/>Poesy's unfailing River,<br/>Which through Albion winds forever<br/>Lashing with melodious wave<br/>Many a sacred Poet's grave,<br/>Mourn its latest nursling fled?<br/>What though thou with all thy dead<br/>Scarce can for this fame repay<br/>Aught thine own? oh, rather say<br/>Though thy sins and slaveries foul<br/>Overcloud a sunlike soul?<br/>As the ghost of Homer clings<br/>Round Scamander's wasting springs;<br/>As divinest Shakespeare's might<br/>Fills Avon and the world with light<br/>Like omniscient power which he<br/>Imaged 'mid mortality;<br/>As the love from Petrarch's urn,<br/>Yet amid yon hills doth burn,<br/>A quenchless lamp by which the heart<br/>Sees things unearthly;--so thou art,<br/>Mighty spirit--so shall be<br/>The City that did refuge thee.<br/><br/>Lo, the sun floats up the sky<br/>Like thought-winged Liberty,<br/>Till the universal light<br/>Seems to level plain and height;<br/>From the sea a mist has spread,<br/>And the beams of morn lie dead<br/>On the towers of Venice now,<br/>Like its glory long ago.<br/>By the skirts of that gray cloud<br/>Many-domed Padua proud<br/>Stands, a peopled solitude,<br/>'Mid the harvest-shining plain,<br/>Where the peasant heaps his grain<br/>In the garner of his foe,<br/>And the milk-white oxen slow<br/>With the purple vintage strain,<br/>Heaped upon the creaking wain,<br/>That the brutal Celt may swill<br/>Drunken sleep with savage will;<br/>And the sickle to the sword<br/>Lies unchanged, though many a lord,<br/>Like a weed whose shade is poison,<br/>Overgrows this region's foison,<br/>Sheaves of whom are ripe to come<br/>To destruction's harvest-home:<br/>Men must reap the things they sow,<br/>Force from force must ever flow,<br/>Or worse; but 'tis a bitter woe<br/>That love or reason cannot change<br/>The despot's rage, the slave's revenge.<br/><br/>Padua, thou within whose walls<br/>Those mute guests at festivals,<br/>Son and Mother, Death and Sin,<br/>Played at dice for Ezzelin,<br/>Till Death cried, "I win, I win!"<br/>And Sin cursed to lose the wager,<br/>But Death promised, to assuage her,<br/>That he would petition for<br/>Her to be made Vice-Emperor,<br/>When the destined years were o'er,<br/>Over all between the Po<br/>And the eastern Alpine snow,<br/>Under the mighty Austrian.<br/>Sin smiled so as Sin only can,<br/>And since that time, ay, long before,<br/>Both have ruled from shore to shore,--<br/>That incestuous pair, who follow<br/>Tyrants as the sun the swallow,<br/>As Repentance follows Crime,<br/>And as changes follow Time.<br/><br/>In thine halls the lamp of learning,<br/>Padua, now no more is burning;<br/>Like a meteor, whose wild way<br/>Is lost over the grave of day,<br/>It gleams betrayed and to betray:<br/>Once remotest nations came<br/>To adore that sacred flame,<br/>When it lit not many a hearth<br/>On this cold and gloomy earth:<br/>Now new fires from antique light<br/>Spring beneath the wide world's might;<br/>But their spark lies dead in thee,<br/>Trampled out by Tyranny.<br/>As the Norway woodman quells,<br/>In the depth of piny dells,<br/>One light flame among the brakes,<br/>While the boundless forest shakes,<br/>And its mighty trunks are torn<br/>By the fire thus lowly born:<br/>The spark beneath his feet is dead,<br/>He starts to see the flames it fed<br/>Howling through the darkened sky<br/>With a myriad tongues victoriously,<br/>And sinks down in fear: so thou,<br/>O Tyranny, beholdest now<br/>Light around thee, and thou hearest<br/>The loud flames ascend, and fearest:<br/>Grovel on the earth; ay, hide<br/>In the dust thy purple pride!<br/><br/>Noon descends around me now:<br/>'Tis the noon of autumn's glow,<br/>When a soft and purple mist<br/>Like a vaporous amethyst,<br/>Or an air-dissolved star<br/>Mingling light and fragrance, far<br/>From the curved horizon's bound<br/>To the point of Heaven's profound,<br/>Fills the overflowing sky;<br/>And the plains that silent lie<br/>Underneath, the leaves unsodden<br/>Where the infant Frost has trodden<br/>With his morning-winged feet,<br/>Whose bright print is gleaming yet;<br/>And the red and golden vines,<br/>Piercing with their trellised lines<br/>The rough, dark-skirted wilderness;<br/>The dun and bladed grass no less,<br/>Pointing from this hoary tower<br/>In the windless air; the flower<br/>Glimmering at my feet; the line<br/>Of the olive-sandalled Apennine<br/>In the south dimly islanded;<br/>And the Alps, whose snows are spread<br/>High between the clouds and sun;<br/>And of living things each one;<br/>And my spirit which so long<br/>Darkened this swift stream of song,--<br/>Interpenetrated lie<br/>By the glory of the sky:<br/>Be it love, light, harmony,<br/>Odour, or the soul of all<br/>Which from Heaven like dew doth fall,<br/>Or the mind which feeds this verse<br/>Peopling the lone universe.<br/><br/>Noon descends, and after noon<br/>Autumn's evening meets me soon,<br/>Leading the infantine moon,<br/>And that one star, which to her<br/>Almost seems to minister<br/>Half the crimson light she brings<br/>From the sunset's radiant springs:<br/>And the soft dreams of the morn<br/>(Which like winged winds had borne<br/>To that silent isle, which lies<br/>Mid remembered agonies,<br/>The frail bark of this lone being)<br/>Pass, to other sufferers fleeing,<br/>And its ancient pilot, Pain,<br/>Sits beside the helm again.<br/><br/>Other flowering isles must be<br/>In the sea of Life and Agony:<br/>Other spirits float and flee<br/>O'er that gulf: even now, perhaps,<br/>On some rock the wild wave wraps,<br/>With folded wings they waiting sit<br/>For my bark, to pilot it<br/>To some calm and blooming cove,<br/>Where for me, and those I love,<br/>May a windless bower be built,<br/>Far from passion, pain, and guilt,<br/>In a dell mid lawny hills,<br/>Which the wild sea-murmur fills,<br/>And soft sunshine, and the sound<br/>Of old forests echoing round,<br/>And the light and smell divine<br/>Of all flowers that breathe and shine:<br/>We may live so happy there,<br/>That the Spirits of the Air,<br/>Envying us, may even entice<br/>To our healing Paradise<br/>The polluting multitude;<br/>But their rage would be subdued<br/>By that clime divine and calm,<br/>And the winds whose wings rain balm<br/>On the uplifted soul, and leaves<br/>Under which the bright sea heaves;<br/>While each breathless interval<br/>In their whisperings musical<br/>The inspired soul supplies<br/>With its own deep melodies;<br/>And the love which heals all strife<br/>Circling, like the breath of life,<br/>All things in that sweet abode<br/>With its own mild brotherhood,<br/>They, not it, would change; and soon<br/>Every sprite beneath the moon<br/>Would repent its envy vain,<br/>And the earth grow young again.
