  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To my dear Sister, Mrs. C. P. on her Nuptial by *Katherine Philips*

<p>
    We will not like those men our offerings pay<br/>Who crown the cup, then think they crown the day.<br/>We make no garlands, nor an altar build,<br/>Which help not Joy, but Ostentation yield.<br/>Where mirth is justly grounded these wild toyes<br/>Are but a troublesome, and empty noise.<br/><br/>2.<br/>But these shall be my great Solemnities,<br/>Orinda's wishes for Cassandra's bliss.<br/>May her Content be as unmix'd and pure<br/>As my Affection, and like that endure;<br/>And that strong Happiness may she still find<br/>Not owing to her Fortune, but her Mind.<br/><br/>3.<br/>May her Content and Duty be the same,<br/>And may she know no Grief but in the name.<br/>May his and her Pleasure and Love be so<br/>Involv'd and growing, that we may not know<br/>Who most Affection or most Peace engrost;<br/>Whose Love is strongest, or whose Bliss is most.<br/><br/>4.<br/>May nothing accidental e're appear<br/>But what shall with new bonds their Souls endear;<br/>And may they count the hours as they pass,<br/>By their own Joys, and not by Sun or Glass:<br/>While every day like this may Sacred prove<br/>To Friendship, Gratitude, and Strictest Love.
</p>
