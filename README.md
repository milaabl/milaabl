  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Princess (part 4) by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    'There sinks the nebulous star we call the Sun,<br/>If that hypothesis of theirs be sound'<br/>Said Ida; 'let us down and rest;' and we<br/>Down from the lean and wrinkled precipices,<br/>By every coppice-feathered chasm and cleft,<br/>Dropt through the ambrosial gloom to where below<br/>No bigger than a glow-worm shone the tent<br/>Lamp-lit from the inner. Once she leaned on me,<br/>Descending; once or twice she lent her hand,<br/>And blissful palpitations in the blood,<br/>Stirring a sudden transport rose and fell.<br/><br/>But when we planted level feet, and dipt<br/>Beneath the satin dome and entered in,<br/>There leaning deep in broidered down we sank<br/>Our elbows: on a tripod in the midst<br/>A fragrant flame rose, and before us glowed<br/>Fruit, blossom, viand, amber wine, and gold.<br/><br/>Then she, 'Let some one sing to us: lightlier move<br/>The minutes fledged with music:' and a maid,<br/>Of those beside her, smote her harp, and sang.<br/><br/><br/>'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,<br/>Tears from the depth of some divine despair<br/>Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,<br/>In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,<br/>And thinking of the days that are no more.<br/><br/>'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,<br/>That brings our friends up from the underworld,<br/>Sad as the last which reddens over one<br/>That sinks with all we love below the verge;<br/>So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.<br/><br/>'Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns<br/>The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds<br/>To dying ears, when unto dying eyes<br/>The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;<br/>So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.<br/><br/>'Dear as remembered kisses after death,<br/>And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned<br/>On lips that are for others; deep as love,<br/>Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;<br/>O Death in Life, the days that are no more.'<br/><br/><br/>She ended with such passion that the tear,<br/>She sang of, shook and fell, an erring pearl<br/>Lost in her bosom: but with some disdain<br/>Answered the Princess, 'If indeed there haunt<br/>About the mouldered lodges of the Past<br/>So sweet a voice and vague, fatal to men,<br/>Well needs it we should cram our ears with wool<br/>And so pace by: but thine are fancies hatched<br/>In silken-folded idleness; nor is it<br/>Wiser to weep a true occasion lost,<br/>But trim our sails, and let old bygones be,<br/>While down the streams that float us each and all<br/>To the issue, goes, like glittering bergs of ice,<br/>Throne after throne, and molten on the waste<br/>Becomes a cloud: for all things serve their time<br/>Toward that great year of equal mights and rights,<br/>Nor would I fight with iron laws, in the end<br/>Found golden: let the past be past; let be<br/>Their cancelled Babels: though the rough kex break<br/>The starred mosaic, and the beard-blown goat<br/>Hang on the shaft, and the wild figtree split<br/>Their monstrous idols, care not while we hear<br/>A trumpet in the distance pealing news<br/>Of better, and Hope, a poising eagle, burns<br/>Above the unrisen morrow:' then to me;<br/>'Know you no song of your own land,' she said,<br/>'Not such as moans about the retrospect,<br/>But deals with the other distance and the hues<br/>Of promise; not a death's-head at the wine.'<br/><br/>Then I remembered one myself had made,<br/>What time I watched the swallow winging south<br/>From mine own land, part made long since, and part<br/>Now while I sang, and maidenlike as far<br/>As I could ape their treble, did I sing.<br/><br/><br/>'O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,<br/>Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,<br/>And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.<br/><br/>'O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,<br/>That bright and fierce and fickle is the South,<br/>And dark and true and tender is the North.<br/><br/>'O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light<br/>Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,<br/>And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.<br/><br/>'O were I thou that she might take me in,<br/>And lay me on her bosom, and her heart<br/>Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.<br/><br/>'Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,<br/>Delaying as the tender ash delays<br/>To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?<br/><br/>'O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:<br/>Say to her, I do but wanton in the South,<br/>But in the North long since my nest is made.<br/><br/>'O tell her, brief is life but love is long,<br/>And brief the sun of summer in the North,<br/>And brief the moon of beauty in the South.<br/><br/>'O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,<br/>Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,<br/>And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.'<br/><br/><br/>I ceased, and all the ladies, each at each,<br/>Like the Ithacensian suitors in old time,<br/>Stared with great eyes, and laughed with alien lips,<br/>And knew not what they meant; for still my voice<br/>Rang false: but smiling 'Not for thee,' she said,<br/>O Bulbul, any rose of Gulistan<br/>Shall burst her veil: marsh-divers, rather, maid,<br/>Shall croak thee sister, or the meadow-crake<br/>Grate her harsh kindred in the grass: and this<br/>A mere love-poem! O for such, my friend,<br/>We hold them slight: they mind us of the time<br/>When we made bricks in Egypt. Knaves are men,<br/>That lute and flute fantastic tenderness,<br/>And dress the victim to the offering up,<br/>And paint the gates of Hell with Paradise,<br/>And play the slave to gain the tyranny.<br/>Poor soul! I had a maid of honour once;<br/>She wept her true eyes blind for such a one,<br/>A rogue of canzonets and serenades.<br/>I loved her. Peace be with her. She is dead.<br/>So they blaspheme the muse! But great is song<br/>Used to great ends: ourself have often tried<br/>Valkyrian hymns, or into rhythm have dashed<br/>The passion of the prophetess; for song<br/>Is duer unto freedom, force and growth<br/>Of spirit than to junketing and love.<br/>Love is it? Would this same mock-love, and this<br/>Mock-Hymen were laid up like winter bats,<br/>Till all men grew to rate us at our worth,<br/>Not vassals to be beat, nor pretty babes<br/>To be dandled, no, but living wills, and sphered<br/>Whole in ourselves and owed to none. Enough!<br/>But now to leaven play with profit, you,<br/>Know you no song, the true growth of your soil,<br/>That gives the manners of your country-women?'<br/><br/>She spoke and turned her sumptuous head with eyes<br/>Of shining expectation fixt on mine.<br/>Then while I dragged my brains for such a song,<br/>Cyril, with whom the bell-mouthed glass had wrought,<br/>Or mastered by the sense of sport, began<br/>To troll a careless, careless tavern-catch<br/>Of Moll and Meg, and strange experiences<br/>Unmeet for ladies. Florian nodded at him,<br/>I frowning; Psyche flushed and wanned and shook;<br/>The lilylike Melissa drooped her brows;<br/>'Forbear,' the Princess cried; 'Forbear, Sir' I;<br/>And heated through and through with wrath and love,<br/>I smote him on the breast; he started up;<br/>There rose a shriek as of a city sacked;<br/>Melissa clamoured 'Flee the death;' 'To horse'<br/>Said Ida; 'home! to horse!' and fled, as flies<br/>A troop of snowy doves athwart the dusk,<br/>When some one batters at the dovecote-doors,<br/>Disorderly the women. Alone I stood<br/>With Florian, cursing Cyril, vext at heart,<br/>In the pavilion: there like parting hopes<br/>I heard them passing from me: hoof by hoof,<br/>And every hoof a knell to my desires,<br/>Clanged on the bridge; and then another shriek,<br/>'The Head, the Head, the Princess, O the Head!'<br/>For blind with rage she missed the plank, and rolled<br/>In the river. Out I sprang from glow to gloom:<br/>There whirled her white robe like a blossomed branch<br/>Rapt to the horrible fall: a glance I gave,<br/>No more; but woman-vested as I was<br/>Plunged; and the flood drew; yet I caught her; then<br/>Oaring one arm, and bearing in my left<br/>The weight of all the hopes of half the world,<br/>Strove to buffet to land in vain. A tree<br/>Was half-disrooted from his place and stooped<br/>To wrench his dark locks in the gurgling wave<br/>Mid-channel. Right on this we drove and caught,<br/>And grasping down the boughs I gained the shore.<br/><br/>There stood her maidens glimmeringly grouped<br/>In the hollow bank. One reaching forward drew<br/>My burthen from mine arms; they cried 'she lives:'<br/>They bore her back into the tent: but I,<br/>So much a kind of shame within me wrought,<br/>Not yet endured to meet her opening eyes,<br/>Nor found my friends; but pushed alone on foot<br/>(For since her horse was lost I left her mine)<br/>Across the woods, and less from Indian craft<br/>Than beelike instinct hiveward, found at length<br/>The garden portals. Two great statues, Art<br/>And Science, Caryatids, lifted up<br/>A weight of emblem, and betwixt were valves<br/>Of open-work in which the hunter rued<br/>His rash intrusion, manlike, but his brows<br/>Had sprouted, and the branches thereupon<br/>Spread out at top, and grimly spiked the gates.<br/><br/>A little space was left between the horns,<br/>Through which I clambered o'er at top with pain,<br/>Dropt on the sward, and up the linden walks,<br/>And, tost on thoughts that changed from hue to hue,<br/>Now poring on the glowworm, now the star,<br/>I paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheeled<br/>Through a great arc his seven slow suns.<br/>A step<br/>Of lightest echo, then a loftier form<br/>Than female, moving through the uncertain gloom,<br/>Disturbed me with the doubt 'if this were she,'<br/>But it was Florian. 'Hist O Hist,' he said,<br/>'They seek us: out so late is out of rules.<br/>Moreover "seize the strangers" is the cry.<br/>How came you here?' I told him: 'I' said he,<br/>'Last of the train, a moral leper, I,<br/>To whom none spake, half-sick at heart, returned.<br/>Arriving all confused among the rest<br/>With hooded brows I crept into the hall,<br/>And, couched behind a Judith, underneath<br/>The head of Holofernes peeped and saw.<br/>Girl after girl was called to trial: each<br/>Disclaimed all knowledge of us: last of all,<br/>Melissa: trust me, Sir, I pitied her.<br/>She, questioned if she knew us men, at first<br/>Was silent; closer prest, denied it not:<br/>And then, demanded if her mother knew,<br/>Or Psyche, she affirmed not, or denied:<br/>From whence the Royal mind, familiar with her,<br/>Easily gathered either guilt. She sent<br/>For Psyche, but she was not there; she called<br/>For Psyche's child to cast it from the doors;<br/>She sent for Blanche to accuse her face to face;<br/>And I slipt out: but whither will you now?<br/>And where are Psyche, Cyril? both are fled:<br/>What, if together? that were not so well.<br/>Would rather we had never come! I dread<br/>His wildness, and the chances of the dark.'<br/><br/>'And yet,' I said, 'you wrong him more than I<br/>That struck him: this is proper to the clown,<br/>Though smocked, or furred and purpled, still the clown,<br/>To harm the thing that trusts him, and to shame<br/>That which he says he loves: for Cyril, howe'er<br/>He deal in frolic, as tonight--the song<br/>Might have been worse and sinned in grosser lips<br/>Beyond all pardon--as it is, I hold<br/>These flashes on the surface are not he.<br/>He has a solid base of temperament:<br/>But as the waterlily starts and slides<br/>Upon the level in little puffs of wind,<br/>Though anchored to the bottom, such is he.'<br/><br/>Scarce had I ceased when from a tamarisk near<br/>Two Proctors leapt upon us, crying, 'Names:'<br/>He, standing still, was clutched; but I began<br/>To thrid the musky-circled mazes, wind<br/>And double in and out the boles, and race<br/>By all the fountains: fleet I was of foot:<br/>Before me showered the rose in flakes; behind<br/>I heard the puffed pursuer; at mine ear<br/>Bubbled the nightingale and heeded not,<br/>And secret laughter tickled all my soul.<br/>At last I hooked my ankle in a vine,<br/>That claspt the feet of a Mnemosyne,<br/>And falling on my face was caught and known.<br/><br/>They haled us to the Princess where she sat<br/>High in the hall: above her drooped a lamp,<br/>And made the single jewel on her brow<br/>Burn like the mystic fire on a mast-head,<br/>Prophet of storm: a handmaid on each side<br/>Bowed toward her, combing out her long black hair<br/>Damp from the river; and close behind her stood<br/>Eight daughters of the plough, stronger than men,<br/>Huge women blowzed with health, and wind, and rain,<br/>And labour. Each was like a Druid rock;<br/>Or like a spire of land that stands apart<br/>Cleft from the main, and wailed about with mews.<br/><br/>Then, as we came, the crowd dividing clove<br/>An advent to the throne: and therebeside,<br/>Half-naked as if caught at once from bed<br/>And tumbled on the purple footcloth, lay<br/>The lily-shining child; and on the left,<br/>Bowed on her palms and folded up from wrong,<br/>Her round white shoulder shaken with her sobs,<br/>Melissa knelt; but Lady Blanche erect<br/>Stood up and spake, an affluent orator.<br/><br/>'It was not thus, O Princess, in old days:<br/>You prized my counsel, lived upon my lips:<br/>I led you then to all the Castalies;<br/>I fed you with the milk of every Muse;<br/>I loved you like this kneeler, and you me<br/>Your second mother: those were gracious times.<br/>Then came your new friend: you began to change--<br/>I saw it and grieved--to slacken and to cool;<br/>Till taken with her seeming openness<br/>You turned your warmer currents all to her,<br/>To me you froze: this was my meed for all.<br/>Yet I bore up in part from ancient love,<br/>And partly that I hoped to win you back,<br/>And partly conscious of my own deserts,<br/>And partly that you were my civil head,<br/>And chiefly you were born for something great,<br/>In which I might your fellow-worker be,<br/>When time should serve; and thus a noble scheme<br/>Grew up from seed we two long since had sown;<br/>In us true growth, in her a Jonah's gourd,<br/>Up in one night and due to sudden sun:<br/>We took this palace; but even from the first<br/>You stood in your own light and darkened mine.<br/>What student came but that you planed her path<br/>To Lady Psyche, younger, not so wise,<br/>A foreigner, and I your countrywoman,<br/>I your old friend and tried, she new in all?<br/>But still her lists were swelled and mine were lean;<br/>Yet I bore up in hope she would be known:<br/>Then came these wolves: ~they~ knew her: ~they~ endured,<br/>Long-closeted with her the yestermorn,<br/>To tell her what they were, and she to hear:<br/>And me none told: not less to an eye like mine<br/>A lidless watcher of the public weal,<br/>Last night, their mask was patent, and my foot<br/>Was to you: but I thought again: I feared<br/>To meet a cold "We thank you, we shall hear of it<br/>From Lady Psyche:" you had gone to her,<br/>She told, perforce; and winning easy grace<br/>No doubt, for slight delay, remained among us<br/>In our young nursery still unknown, the stem<br/>Less grain than touchwood, while my honest heat<br/>Were all miscounted as malignant haste<br/>To push my rival out of place and power.<br/>But public use required she should be known;<br/>And since my oath was ta'en for public use,<br/>I broke the letter of it to keep the sense.<br/>I spoke not then at first, but watched them well,<br/>Saw that they kept apart, no mischief done;<br/>And yet this day (though you should hate me for it)<br/>I came to tell you; found that you had gone,<br/>Ridden to the hills, she likewise: now, I thought,<br/>That surely she will speak; if not, then I:<br/>Did she? These monsters blazoned what they were,<br/>According to the coarseness of their kind,<br/>For thus I hear; and known at last (my work)<br/>And full of cowardice and guilty shame,<br/>I grant in her some sense of shame, she flies;<br/>And I remain on whom to wreak your rage,<br/>I, that have lent my life to build up yours,<br/>I that have wasted here health, wealth, and time,<br/>And talent, I--you know it--I will not boast:<br/>Dismiss me, and I prophesy your plan,<br/>Divorced from my experience, will be chaff<br/>For every gust of chance, and men will say<br/>We did not know the real light, but chased<br/>The wisp that flickers where no foot can tread.'<br/><br/>She ceased: the Princess answered coldly, 'Good:<br/>Your oath is broken: we dismiss you: go.<br/>For this lost lamb (she pointed to the child)<br/>Our mind is changed: we take it to ourself.'<br/><br/>Thereat the Lady stretched a vulture throat,<br/>And shot from crooked lips a haggard smile.<br/>'The plan was mine. I built the nest' she said<br/>'To hatch the cuckoo. Rise!' and stooped to updrag<br/>Melissa: she, half on her mother propt,<br/>Half-drooping from her, turned her face, and cast<br/>A liquid look on Ida, full of prayer,<br/>Which melted Florian's fancy as she hung,<br/>A Niob√´an daughter, one arm out,<br/>Appealing to the bolts of Heaven; and while<br/>We gazed upon her came a little stir<br/>About the doors, and on a sudden rushed<br/>Among us, out of breath as one pursued,<br/>A woman-post in flying raiment. Fear<br/>Stared in her eyes, and chalked her face, and winged<br/>Her transit to the throne, whereby she fell<br/>Delivering sealed dispatches which the Head<br/>Took half-amazed, and in her lion's mood<br/>Tore open, silent we with blind surmise<br/>Regarding, while she read, till over brow<br/>And cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom<br/>As of some fire against a stormy cloud,<br/>When the wild peasant rights himself, the rick<br/>Flames, and his anger reddens in the heavens;<br/>For anger most it seemed, while now her breast,<br/>Beaten with some great passion at her heart,<br/>Palpitated, her hand shook, and we heard<br/>In the dead hush the papers that she held<br/>Rustle: at once the lost lamb at her feet<br/>Sent out a bitter bleating for its dam;<br/>The plaintive cry jarred on her ire; she crushed<br/>The scrolls together, made a sudden turn<br/>As if to speak, but, utterance failing her,<br/>She whirled them on to me, as who should say<br/>'Read,' and I read--two letters--one her sire's.<br/><br/>'Fair daughter, when we sent the Prince your way,<br/>We knew not your ungracious laws, which learnt,<br/>We, conscious of what temper you are built,<br/>Came all in haste to hinder wrong, but fell<br/>Into his father's hands, who has this night,<br/>You lying close upon his territory,<br/>Slipt round and in the dark invested you,<br/>And here he keeps me hostage for his son.'<br/><br/>The second was my father's running thus:<br/>'You have our son: touch not a hair of his head:<br/>Render him up unscathed: give him your hand:<br/>Cleave to your contract: though indeed we hear<br/>You hold the woman is the better man;<br/>A rampant heresy, such as if it spread<br/>Would make all women kick against their Lords<br/>Through all the world, and which might well deserve<br/>That we this night should pluck your palace down;<br/>And we will do it, unless you send us back<br/>Our son, on the instant, whole.'<br/>So far I read;<br/>And then stood up and spoke impetuously.<br/><br/>'O not to pry and peer on your reserve,<br/>But led by golden wishes, and a hope<br/>The child of regal compact, did I break<br/>Your precinct; not a scorner of your sex<br/>But venerator, zealous it should be<br/>All that it might be: hear me, for I bear,<br/>Though man, yet human, whatsoe'er your wrongs,<br/>From the flaxen curl to the gray lock a life<br/>Less mine than yours: my nurse would tell me of you;<br/>I babbled for you, as babies for the moon,<br/>Vague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me<br/>From all high places, lived in all fair lights,<br/>Came in long breezes rapt from inmost south<br/>And blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn<br/>With Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods;<br/>The leader wildswan in among the stars<br/>Would clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light<br/>The mellow breaker murmured Ida. Now,<br/>Because I would have reached you, had you been<br/>Sphered up with Cassiop√´ia, or the enthroned<br/>Persephon√® in Hades, now at length,<br/>Those winters of abeyance all worn out,<br/>A man I came to see you: but indeed,<br/>Not in this frequence can I lend full tongue,<br/>O noble Ida, to those thoughts that wait<br/>On you, their centre: let me say but this,<br/>That many a famous man and woman, town<br/>And landskip, have I heard of, after seen<br/>The dwarfs of presage: though when known, there grew<br/>Another kind of beauty in detail<br/>Made them worth knowing; but in your I found<br/>My boyish dream involved and dazzled down<br/>And mastered, while that after-beauty makes<br/>Such head from act to act, from hour to hour,<br/>Within me, that except you slay me here,<br/>According to your bitter statute-book,<br/>I cannot cease to follow you, as they say<br/>The seal does music; who desire you more<br/>Than growing boys their manhood; dying lips,<br/>With many thousand matters left to do,<br/>The breath of life; O more than poor men wealth,<br/>Than sick men health--yours, yours, not mine--but half<br/>Without you; with you, whole; and of those halves<br/>You worthiest; and howe'er you block and bar<br/>Your heart with system out from mine, I hold<br/>That it becomes no man to nurse despair,<br/>But in the teeth of clenched antagonisms<br/>To follow up the worthiest till he die:<br/>Yet that I came not all unauthorized<br/>Behold your father's letter.'<br/>On one knee<br/>Kneeling, I gave it, which she caught, and dashed<br/>Unopened at her feet: a tide of fierce<br/>Invective seemed to wait behind her lips,<br/>As waits a river level with the dam<br/>Ready to burst and flood the world with foam:<br/>And so she would have spoken, but there rose<br/>A hubbub in the court of half the maids<br/>Gathered together: from the illumined hall<br/>Long lanes of splendour slanted o'er a press<br/>Of snowy shoulders, thick as herded ewes,<br/>And rainbow robes, and gems and gemlike eyes,<br/>And gold and golden heads; they to and fro<br/>Fluctuated, as flowers in storm, some red, some pale,<br/>All open-mouthed, all gazing to the light,<br/>Some crying there was an army in the land,<br/>And some that men were in the very walls,<br/>And some they cared not; till a clamour grew<br/>As of a new-world Babel, woman-built,<br/>And worse-confounded: high above them stood<br/>The placid marble Muses, looking peace.<br/><br/>Not peace she looked, the Head: but rising up<br/>Robed in the long night of her deep hair, so<br/>To the open window moved, remaining there<br/>Fixt like a beacon-tower above the waves<br/>Of tempest, when the crimson-rolling eye<br/>Glares ruin, and the wild birds on the light<br/>Dash themselves dead. She stretched her arms and called<br/>Across the tumult and the tumult fell.<br/><br/>'What fear ye, brawlers? am not I your Head?<br/>On me, me, me, the storm first breaks: ~I~ dare<br/>All these male thunderbolts: what is it ye fear?<br/>Peace! there are those to avenge us and they come:<br/>If not,--myself were like enough, O girls,<br/>To unfurl the maiden banner of our rights,<br/>And clad in iron burst the ranks of war,<br/>Or, falling, promartyr of our cause,<br/>Die: yet I blame you not so much for fear:<br/>Six thousand years of fear have made you that<br/>From which I would redeem you: but for those<br/>That stir this hubbub--you and you--I know<br/>Your faces there in the crowd--tomorrow morn<br/>We hold a great convention: then shall they<br/>That love their voices more than duty, learn<br/>With whom they deal, dismissed in shame to live<br/>No wiser than their mothers, household stuff,<br/>Live chattels, mincers of each other's fame,<br/>Full of weak poison, turnspits for the clown,<br/>The drunkard's football, laughing-stocks of Time,<br/>Whose brains are in their hands and in their heels<br/>But fit to flaunt, to dress, to dance, to thrum,<br/>To tramp, to scream, to burnish, and to scour,<br/>For ever slaves at home and fools abroad.'<br/><br/>She, ending, waved her hands: thereat the crowd<br/>Muttering, dissolved: then with a smile, that looked<br/>A stroke of cruel sunshine on the cliff,<br/>When all the glens are drowned in azure gloom<br/>Of thunder-shower, she floated to us and said:<br/><br/>'You have done well and like a gentleman,<br/>And like a prince: you have our thanks for all:<br/>And you look well too in your woman's dress:<br/>Well have you done and like a gentleman.<br/>You saved our life: we owe you bitter thanks:<br/>Better have died and spilt our bones in the flood--<br/>Then men had said--but now--What hinders me<br/>To take such bloody vengeance on you both?--<br/>Yet since our father--Wasps in our good hive,<br/>You would-be quenchers of the light to be,<br/>Barbarians, grosser than your native bears--<br/>O would I had his sceptre for one hour!<br/>You that have dared to break our bound, and gulled<br/>Our servants, wronged and lied and thwarted us--<br/>~I~ wed with thee! ~I~ bound by precontract<br/>Your bride, our bondslave! not though all the gold<br/>That veins the world were packed to make your crown,<br/>And every spoken tongue should lord you. Sir,<br/>Your falsehood and yourself are hateful to us:<br/>I trample on your offers and on you:<br/>Begone: we will not look upon you more.<br/>Here, push them out at gates.'<br/>In wrath she spake.<br/>Then those eight mighty daughters of the plough<br/>Bent their broad faces toward us and addressed<br/>Their motion: twice I sought to plead my cause,<br/>But on my shoulder hung their heavy hands,<br/>The weight of destiny: so from her face<br/>They pushed us, down the steps, and through the court,<br/>And with grim laughter thrust us out at gates.<br/><br/>We crossed the street and gained a petty mound<br/>Beyond it, whence we saw the lights and heard the voices murmuring. While I listened, came<br/>On a sudden the weird seizure and the doubt:<br/>I seemed to move among a world of ghosts;<br/>The Princess with her monstrous woman-guard,<br/>The jest and earnest working side by side,<br/>The cataract and the tumult and the kings<br/>Were shadows; and the long fantastic night<br/>With all its doings had and had not been,<br/>And all things were and were not.<br/>This went by<br/>As strangely as it came, and on my spirits<br/>Settled a gentle cloud of melancholy;<br/>Not long; I shook it off; for spite of doubts<br/>And sudden ghostly shadowings I was one<br/>To whom the touch of all mischance but came<br/>As night to him that sitting on a hill<br/>Sees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun<br/>Set into sunrise; then we moved away.<br/><br/><br/>Thy voice is heard through rolling drums,<br/>That beat to battle where he stands;<br/>Thy face across his fancy comes,<br/>And gives the battle to his hands:<br/>A moment, while the trumpets blow,<br/>He sees his brood about thy knee;<br/>The next, like fire he meets the foe,<br/>And strikes him dead for thine and thee.<br/><br/><br/>So Lilia sang: we thought her half-possessed,<br/>She struck such warbling fury through the words;<br/>And, after, feigning pique at what she called<br/>The raillery, or grotesque, or false sublime--<br/>Like one that wishes at a dance to change<br/>The music--clapt her hands and cried for war,<br/>Or some grand fight to kill and make an end:<br/>And he that next inherited the tale<br/>Half turning to the broken statue, said,<br/>'Sir Ralph has got your colours: if I prove<br/>Your knight, and fight your battle, what for me?'<br/>It chanced, her empty glove upon the tomb<br/>Lay by her like a model of her hand.<br/>She took it and she flung it. 'Fight' she said,<br/>'And make us all we would be, great and good.'<br/>He knightlike in his cap instead of casque,<br/>A cap of Tyrol borrowed from the hall,<br/>Arranged the favour, and assumed the Prince.
