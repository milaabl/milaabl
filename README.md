<!-- Start poem -->
# 💮 Matilda Gathering Flowers by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    FROM THE PURGATORIO OF DANTE, CANTO 28, LINES 1-51.<br/><br/>And earnest to explore within--around--<br/>The divine wood, whose thick green living woof<br/>Tempered the young day to the sight--I wound<br/><br/>Up the green slope, beneath the forest's roof,<br/>With slow, soft steps leaving the mountain's steep,<br/>And sought those inmost labyrinths, motion-proof<br/><br/>Against the air, that in that stillness deep<br/>And solemn, struck upon my forehead bare,<br/>The slow, soft stroke of a continuous...<br/><br/>In which the ... leaves tremblingly were<br/>All bent towards that part where earliest<br/>The sacred hill obscures the morning air.<br/><br/>Yet were they not so shaken from the rest,<br/>But that the birds, perched on the utmost spray,<br/>Incessantly renewing their blithe quest,<br/><br/>With perfect joy received the early day,<br/>Singing within the glancing leaves, whose sound<br/>Kept a low burden to their roundelay,<br/><br/>Such as from bough to bough gathers around<br/>The pine forest on bleak Chiassi's shore,<br/>When Aeolus Sirocco has unbound.<br/><br/>My slow steps had already borne me o'er<br/>Such space within the antique wood, that I<br/>Perceived not where I entered any more,--<br/><br/>When, lo! a stream whose little waves went by,<br/>Bending towards the left through grass that grew<br/>Upon its bank, impeded suddenly<br/><br/>My going on. Water of purest hue<br/>On earth, would appear turbid and impure<br/>Compared with this, whose unconcealing dew,<br/><br/>Dark, dark, yet clear, moved under the obscure<br/>Eternal shades, whose interwoven looms<br/>The rays of moon or sunlight ne'er endure.<br/><br/>I moved not with my feet, but mid the glooms<br/>Pierced with my charmed eye, contemplating<br/>The mighty multitude of fresh May blooms<br/><br/>Which starred that night, when, even as a thing<br/>That suddenly, for blank astonishment,<br/>Charms every sense, and makes all thought take wing,--<br/><br/>A solitary woman! and she went<br/>Singing and gathering flower after flower,<br/>With which her way was painted and besprent.<br/><br/>'Bright lady, who, if looks had ever power<br/>To bear true witness of the heart within,<br/>Dost bask under the beams of love, come lower<br/><br/>Towards this bank. I prithee let me win<br/>This much of thee, to come, that I may hear<br/>Thy song: like Proserpine, in Enna's glen,<br/><br/>Thou seemest to my fancy, singing here<br/>And gathering flowers, as that fair maiden when<br/>She lost the Spring, and Ceres her, more dear.
</p>
