# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer's Tale of Sir Thopas. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>WHEN said was this miracle, every man<br/>As sober was, that wonder was to see,<br/>Till that our Host to japen he began,<br/>And then at erst he looked upon me,<br/>And saide thus; "What man art thou?" quoth he;<br/>"Thou lookest as thou wouldest find an hare,<br/>For ever on the ground I see thee stare.<br/><br/>"Approache near, and look up merrily.<br/>Now ware you, Sirs, and let this man have place.<br/>He in the waist is shapen as well as I;<br/>This were a puppet in an arm t'embrace<br/>For any woman small and fair of face.<br/>He seemeth elvish by his countenance,<br/>For unto no wight doth he dalliance.<br/><br/>"Say now somewhat, since other folk have said;<br/>Tell us a tale of mirth, and that anon."<br/>"Hoste," quoth I, "be not evil apaid,<br/>For other tale certes can I none,<br/>Eut of a rhyme I learned yore agone."<br/>"Yea, that is good," quoth he; "now shall we hear<br/>Some dainty thing, me thinketh by thy cheer."<br/><br/>THE TALE<br/><br/>The First Fit<br/><br/>Listen, lordings, in good intent,<br/>And I will tell you verrament<br/>Of mirth and of solas,<br/>All of a knight was fair and gent,<br/>In battle and in tournament,<br/>His name was Sir Thopas.<br/><br/>Y-born he was in far country,<br/>In Flanders, all beyond the sea,<br/>At Popering  in the place;<br/>His father was a man full free,<br/>And lord he was of that country,<br/>As it was Godde's grace.<br/><br/>Sir Thopas was a doughty swain,<br/>White was his face as paindemain,<br/>His lippes red as rose.<br/>His rode is like scarlet in grain,<br/>And I you tell in good certain<br/>He had a seemly nose.<br/><br/>His hair, his beard, was like saffroun,<br/>That to his girdle reach'd adown,<br/>His shoes of cordewane:<br/>Of Bruges were his hosen brown;<br/>His robe was of ciclatoun,<br/>That coste many a jane.<br/><br/>He coulde hunt at the wild deer,<br/>And ride on hawking for rivere<br/>With gray goshawk on hand:<br/>Thereto he was a good archere,<br/>Of wrestling was there none his peer,<br/>Where any ram  should stand.<br/><br/>Full many a maiden bright in bow'r<br/>They mourned for him par amour,<br/>When them were better sleep;<br/>But he was chaste, and no lechour,<br/>And sweet as is the bramble flow'r<br/>That beareth the red heep.<br/><br/>And so it fell upon a day,<br/>For sooth as I you telle may,<br/>Sir Thopas would out ride;<br/>He worth upon his steede gray,<br/>And in his hand a launcegay,<br/>A long sword by his side.<br/><br/>He pricked through a fair forest,<br/>Wherein is many a wilde beast,<br/>Yea, bothe buck and hare;<br/>And as he pricked north and east,<br/>I tell it you, him had almest<br/>Betid a sorry care.<br/><br/>There sprange herbes great and small,<br/>The liquorice and the setewall,<br/>And many a clove-gilofre,<br/>And nutemeg to put in ale,<br/>Whether it be moist or stale,<br/>Or for to lay in coffer.<br/><br/>The birdes sang, it is no nay,<br/>The sperhawk and the popinjay,<br/>That joy it was to hear;<br/>The throstle-cock made eke his lay,<br/>The woode-dove upon the spray<br/>She sang full loud and clear.<br/><br/>Sir Thopas fell in love-longing<br/>All when he heard the throstle sing,<br/>And prick'd as he were wood;<br/>His faire steed in his pricking<br/>So sweated, that men might him wring,<br/>His sides were all blood.<br/><br/>Sir Thopas eke so weary was<br/>For pricking on the softe grass,<br/>So fierce was his corage,<br/>That down he laid him in that place,<br/>To make his steed some solace,<br/>And gave him good forage.<br/><br/>"Ah, Saint Mary, ben'dicite,<br/>What aileth thilke love at me<br/>To binde me so sore?<br/>Me dreamed all this night, pardie,<br/>An elf-queen shall my leman be,<br/>And sleep under my gore.<br/><br/>An elf-queen will I love, y-wis,<br/>For in this world no woman is<br/>Worthy to be my make<br/>In town;<br/>All other women I forsake,<br/>And to an elf-queen I me take<br/>By dale and eke by down."<br/><br/>Into his saddle he clomb anon,<br/>And pricked over stile and stone<br/>An elf-queen for to spy,<br/>Till he so long had ridden and gone,<br/>That he found in a privy wonne<br/>The country of Faery,<br/>So wild;<br/>For in that country was there none<br/>That to him durste ride or gon,<br/>Neither wife nor child.<br/><br/>Till that there came a great giaunt,<br/>His name was Sir Oliphaunt,<br/>A perilous man of deed;<br/>He saide, "Child, by Termagaunt,<br/>But if thou prick out of mine haunt,<br/>Anon I slay thy steed<br/>With mace.<br/>Here is the Queen of Faery,<br/>With harp, and pipe, and symphony,<br/>Dwelling in this place."<br/><br/>The Child said, "All so may I the,<br/>To-morrow will I meete thee,<br/>When I have mine armor;<br/>And yet I hope, par ma fay,<br/>That thou shalt with this launcegay<br/>Abyen it full sore;<br/>Thy maw<br/>Shall I pierce, if I may,<br/>Ere it be fully prime of day,<br/>For here thou shalt be slaw."<br/><br/>Sir Thopas drew aback full fast;<br/>This giant at him stones cast<br/>Out of a fell staff sling:<br/>But fair escaped Child Thopas,<br/>And all it was through Godde's grace,<br/>And through his fair bearing.<br/><br/>Yet listen, lordings, to my tale,<br/>Merrier than the nightingale,<br/>For now I will you rown,<br/>How Sir Thopas, with sides smale,<br/>Pricking over hill and dale,<br/>Is come again to town.<br/><br/>His merry men commanded he<br/>To make him both game and glee;<br/>For needes must he fight<br/>With a giant with heades three,<br/>For paramour and jollity<br/>Of one that shone full bright.<br/><br/>"Do come," he saide, "my minstrales<br/>And gestours for to telle tales.<br/>Anon in mine arming,<br/>Of romances that be royales,<br/>Of popes and of cardinales,<br/>And eke of love-longing."<br/><br/>They fetch'd him first the sweete wine,<br/>And mead eke in a maseline,<br/>And royal spicery;<br/>Of ginger-bread that was full fine,<br/>And liquorice and eke cumin,<br/>With sugar that is trie.<br/><br/>He didde, next his white lere,<br/>Of cloth of lake fine and clear,<br/>A breech and eke a shirt;<br/>And next his shirt an haketon,<br/>And over that an habergeon,<br/>For piercing of his heart;<br/><br/>And over that a fine hauberk,<br/>Was all y-wrought of Jewes' werk,<br/>Full strong it was of plate;<br/>And over that his coat-armour,<br/>As white as is the lily flow'r,<br/>In which he would debate.<br/><br/>His shield was all of gold so red<br/>And therein was a boare's head,<br/>A charboucle beside;<br/>And there he swore on ale and bread,<br/>How that the giant should be dead,<br/>Betide whatso betide.<br/><br/>His jambeaux were of cuirbouly,<br/>His sworde's sheath of ivory,<br/>His helm of latoun bright,<br/>His saddle was of rewel  bone,<br/>His bridle as the sunne shone,<br/>Or as the moonelight.<br/><br/>His speare was of fine cypress,<br/>That bodeth war, and nothing peace;<br/>The head full sharp y-ground.<br/>His steede was all dapple gray,<br/>It went an amble in the way<br/>Full softely and round<br/>In land.<br/><br/>Lo, Lordes mine, here is a fytt;<br/>If ye will any more of it,<br/>To tell it will I fand.<br/><br/>The Second Fit<br/><br/>Now hold your mouth for charity,<br/>Bothe knight and lady free,<br/>And hearken to my spell;<br/>Of battle and of chivalry,<br/>Of ladies' love and druerie,<br/>Anon I will you tell.<br/><br/>Men speak of romances of price<br/>Of Horn Child, and of Ipotis,<br/>Of Bevis, and Sir Guy,<br/>Of Sir Libeux,  and Pleindamour,<br/>But Sir Thopas, he bears the flow'r<br/>Of royal chivalry.<br/><br/>His goode steed he all bestrode,<br/>And forth upon his way he glode,<br/>As sparkle out of brand;<br/>Upon his crest he bare a tow'r,<br/>And therein stick'd a lily flow'r;<br/>God shield his corse from shand!<br/><br/>And, for he was a knight auntrous,<br/>He woulde sleepen in none house,<br/>But liggen in his hood,<br/>His brighte helm was his wanger,<br/>And by him baited his destrer<br/>Of herbes fine and good.<br/><br/>Himself drank water of the well,<br/>As did the knight Sir Percivel,<br/>So worthy under weed;<br/>Till on a day -   .   .   .
