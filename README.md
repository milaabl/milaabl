  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Demeter And Persephone by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Faint as a climate-changing bird that flies<br/>All night across the darkness, and at dawn<br/>Falls on the threshold of her native land,<br/>And can no more, thou camest, O my child,<br/>Led upward by the God of ghosts and dreams,<br/>Who laid thee at Eleusis, dazed and dumb,<br/>With passing thro' at once from state to state,<br/>Until I brought thee hither, that the day,<br/>When here thy hands let fall the gather'd flower,<br/>Might break thro' clouded memories once again<br/>On thy lost self. A sudden nightingale<br/>Saw thee, and flash'd into a frolic of song<br/>And welcome; and a gleam as of the moon,<br/>When first she peers along the tremulous deep,<br/>Fled wavering o'er thy face, and chased away<br/>That shadow of a likeness to the king<br/>Of shadows, thy dark mate. Persephone!<br/>Queen of the dead no more -- my child! Thine eyes<br/>Again were human-godlike, and the Sun<br/>Burst from a swimming fleece of winter gray,<br/>And robed thee in his day from head to feet --<br/>"Mother!" and I was folded in thine arms.<br/><br/>Child, those imperial, disimpassion'd eyes<br/>Awed even me at first, thy mother -- eyes<br/>That oft had seen the serpent-wanded power<br/>Draw downward into Hades with his drift<br/>Of fickering spectres, lighted from below<br/>By the red race of fiery Phlegethon;<br/>But when before have Gods or men beheld<br/>The Life that had descended re-arise,<br/>And lighted from above him by the Sun?<br/>So mighty was the mother's childless cry,<br/>A cry that ran thro' Hades, Earth, and Heaven!<br/><br/>So in this pleasant vale we stand again,<br/>The field of Enna, now once more ablaze<br/>With flowers that brighten as thy footstep falls,<br/>All flowers -- but for one black blur of earth<br/>Left by that closing chasm, thro' which the car<br/>Of dark Aidoneus rising rapt thee hence.<br/>And here, my child, tho' folded in thine arms,<br/>I feel the deathless heart of motherhood<br/>Within me shudder, lest the naked glebe<br/>Should yawn once more into the gulf, and thence<br/>The shrilly whinnyings of the team of Hell,<br/>Ascending, pierce the glad and songful air,<br/>And all at once their arch'd necks, midnight-maned,<br/>Jet upward thro' the mid-day blossom. No!<br/>For, see, thy foot has touch'd it; all the space<br/>Of blank earth-baldness clothes itself afresh,<br/>And breaks into the crocus-purple hour<br/>That saw thee vanish.<br/><br/>Child, when thou wert gone,<br/>I envied human wives, and nested birds,<br/>Yea, the cubb'd lioness; went in search of thee<br/>Thro' many a palace, many a cot, and gave<br/>Thy breast to ailing infants in the night,<br/>And set the mother waking in amaze<br/>To find her sick one whole; and forth again<br/>Among the wail of midnight winds, and cried,<br/>"Where is my loved one? Wherefore do ye wail?"<br/>And out from all the night an answer shrill'd,<br/>"We know not, and we know not why we wail."<br/>I climb'd on all the cliffs of all the seas,<br/>And ask'd the waves that moan about the world<br/>"Where? do ye make your moaning for my child?"<br/>And round from all the world the voices came<br/>"We know not, and we know not why we moan."<br/>"Where?" and I stared from every eagle-peak,<br/>I thridded the black heart of all the woods,<br/>I peer'd thro' tomb and cave, and in the storms<br/>Of Autumn swept across the city, and heard<br/>The murmur of their temples chanting me,<br/>Me, me, the desolate Mother! "Where"? -- and turn'd,<br/>And fled by many a waste, forlorn of man,<br/>And grieved for man thro' all my grief for thee, --<br/>The jungle rooted in his shatter'd hearth,<br/>The serpent coil'd about his broken shaft,<br/>The scorpion crawling over naked skulls; --<br/>I saw the tiger in the ruin'd fane<br/>Spring from his fallen God, but trace of thee<br/>I saw not; and far on, and, following out<br/>A league of labyrinthine darkness, came<br/>On three gray heads beneath a gleaming rift.<br/>"Where"? and I heard one voice from all the three<br/>"We know not, for we spin the lives of men,<br/>And not of Gods, and know not why we spin!<br/>There is a Fate beyond us." Nothing knew.<br/><br/>Last as the likeness of a dying man,<br/>Without his knowledge, from him flits to warn<br/>A far-off friendship that he comes no more,<br/>So he, the God of dreams, who heard my cry,<br/>Drew from thyself the likeness of thyself<br/>Without thy knowledge, and thy shadow past<br/>Before me, crying "The Bright one in the highest<br/>Is brother of the Dark one in the lowest,<br/>And Bright and Dark have sworn that I, the child<br/>Of thee, the great Earth-Mother, thee, the Power<br/>That lifts her buried life from loom to bloom,<br/>Should be for ever and for evermore<br/>The Bride of Darkness."<br/><br/>So the Shadow wail'd.<br/>Then I, Earth-Goddess, cursed the Gods of Heaven.<br/>I would not mingle with their feasts; to me<br/>Their nectar smack'd of hemlock on the lips,<br/>Their rich ambrosia tasted aconite.<br/>The man, that only lives and loves an hour,<br/>Seem'd nobler than their hard Eternities.<br/>My quick tears kill'd the flower, my ravings hush'd<br/>The bird, and lost in utter grief I fail'd<br/>To send my life thro' olive-yard and vine<br/>And golden grain, my gift to helpless man.<br/>Rain-rotten died the wheat, the barley-spears<br/>Were hollow-husk'd, the leaf fell, and the sun,<br/>Pale at my grief, drew down before his time<br/>Sickening, and Aetna kept her winter snow.<br/>Then He, the brother of this Darkness, He<br/>Who still is highest, glancing from his height<br/>On earth a fruitless fallow, when he miss'd<br/>The wonted steam of sacrifice, the praise<br/>And prayer of men, decreed that thou should'st dwell<br/>For nine white moons of each whole year with me,<br/>Three dark ones in the shadow with thy King.<br/><br/>Once more the reaper in the gleam of dawn<br/>Will see me by the landmark far away,<br/>Blessing his field, or seated in the dusk<br/>Of even, by the lonely threshing-floor,<br/>Rejoicing in the harvest and the grange.<br/>Yet I, Earth-Goddess, am but ill-content<br/>With them, who still are highest. Those gray heads,<br/>What meant they by their "Fate beyond the Fates"<br/>But younger kindlier Gods to bear us down,<br/>As we bore down the Gods before us? Gods,<br/>To quench, not hurl the thunderbolt, to stay,<br/>Not spread the plague, the famine; Gods indeed,<br/>To send the noon into the night and break<br/>The sunless halls of Hades into Heaven?<br/>Till thy dark lord accept and love the Sun,<br/>And all the Shadow die into the Light,<br/>When thou shalt dwell the whole bright year with me,<br/>And souls of men, who grew beyond their race,<br/>And made themselves as Gods against the fear<br/>Of Death and Hell; and thou that hast from men,<br/>As Queen of Death, that worship which is Fear,<br/>Henceforth, as having risen from out the dead,<br/>Shalt ever send thy life along with mine<br/>From buried grain thro' springing blade, and bless<br/>Their garner'd Autumn also, reap with me,<br/>Earth-mother, in the harvest hymns of Earth<br/>The worship which is Love, and see no more<br/>The Stone, the Wheel, the dimly-glimmering lawns<br/>Of that Elysium, all the hateful fires<br/>Of torment, and the shadowy warrior glide<br/>Along the silent field of Asphodel.
