# üíÆ Ossian's Address to the Sun in "Carthon." by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Oh! thou that roll'st above thy glorious Fire,<br/>Round as the shield which grac'd my godlike Sire,<br/>Whence are the beams, O Sun! thy endless blaze,<br/>Which far eclipse each minor Glory's rays?<br/>Forth in thy Beauty here thou deign'st to shine!<br/>Night quits her car, the twinkling stars decline;<br/>Pallid and cold the Moon descends to cave<br/>Her sinking beams beneath the Western wave;<br/>But thou still mov'st alone, of light the Source--<br/>Who can o'ertake thee in thy fiery course?<br/>Oaks of the mountains fall, the rocks decay,<br/>Weighed down with years the hills dissolve away.<br/>A certain space to yonder Moon is given,<br/>She rises, smiles, and then is lost in Heaven.<br/>Ocean in sullen murmurs ebbs and flows,<br/>But thy bright beam unchanged for ever glows!<br/>When Earth is darkened with tempestuous skies,<br/>When Thunder shakes the sphere and Lightning flies,<br/>Thy face, O Sun, no rolling blasts deform,<br/>Thou look'st from clouds and laughest at the Storm.<br/>To Ossian, Orb of Light! thou look'st in vain,<br/>Nor cans't thou glad his ag√®d eyes again,<br/>Whether thy locks in Orient Beauty stream,<br/>Or glimmer through the West with fainter gleam--<br/>But thou, perhaps, like me with age must bend;<br/>Thy season o'er, thy days will find their end,<br/>No more yon azure vault with rays adorn,<br/>Lull'd in the clouds, nor hear the voice of Morn.<br/>Exult, O Sun, in all thy youthful strength!<br/>Age, dark unlovely Age, appears at length,<br/>As gleams the moonbeam through the broken cloud<br/>While mountain vapours spread their misty shroud--<br/>The Northern tempest howls along at last,<br/>And wayworn strangers shrink amid the blast.<br/>Thou rolling Sun who gild'st those rising towers,<br/>Fair didst thou shine upon my earlier hours!<br/>I hail'd with smiles the cheering rays of Morn,<br/>My breast by no tumultuous Passion torn--<br/>Now hateful are thy beams which wake no more<br/>The sense of joy which thrill'd my breast before;<br/>Welcome thou cloudy veil of nightly skies,<br/>To thy bright canopy the mourner flies:<br/>Once bright, thy Silence lull'd my frame to rest,<br/>And Sleep my soul with gentle visions blest;<br/>Now wakeful Grief disdains her mild controul,<br/>Dark is the night, but darker is my Soul.<br/>Ye warring Winds of Heav'n your fury urge,<br/>To me congenial sounds your wintry Dirge:<br/>Swift as your wings my happier days have past,<br/>Keen as your storms is Sorrow's chilling blast;<br/>To Tempests thus expos'd my Fate has been,<br/>Piercing like yours, like yours, alas! unseen.
