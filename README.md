# üíÆ Count Gismond by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    Christ God who savest man, save most<br/>        Of men Count Gismond who saved me!<br/>Count Gauthier, when he chose his post,<br/>        Chose time and place and company<br/>To suit it; when he struck at length<br/>My honour, 'twas with all his strength.<br/><br/>And doubtlessly ere he could draw<br/>        All points to one, he must have schemed!<br/>That miserable morning saw<br/>        Few half so happy as I seemed,<br/>While being dressed in queen's array<br/>To give our tourney prize away.<br/><br/>I thought they loved me, did me grace<br/>        To please themselves; 'twas all their deed;<br/>God makes, or fair or foul, our face;<br/>        If showing mine so caused to bleed<br/>My cousins' hearts, they should have dropped<br/>A word, and straight the play had stopped.<br/><br/>They, too, so beauteous!  Each a queen<br/>        By virtue of her brow and breast;<br/>Not needing to be crowned, I mean,<br/>        As I do.  E'en when I was dressed,<br/>Had either of them spoke, instead<br/>Of glancing sideways with still head!<br/><br/>But no: they let me laugh, and sing<br/>        My birthday song quite through, adjust<br/>The last rose in my garland, fling<br/>        A last look on the mirror, trust<br/>My arms to each an arm of theirs,<br/>And so descend the castle-stairs--<br/><br/>And come out on the morning-troop<br/>        Of merry friends who kissed my cheek,<br/>And called me queen, and made me stoop<br/>        Under the canopy--a streak<br/>That pierced it, of the outside sun,<br/>Powdered with gold its gloom's soft dun--<br/><br/>And they could let me take my state<br/>        And foolish throne amid applause<br/>Of all come there to celebrate<br/>        My queen's-day--Oh I think the cause<br/>Of much was, they forgot no crowd<br/>Makes up for parents in their shroud!<br/><br/>However that be, all eyes were bent<br/>        Upon me, when my cousins cast<br/>Theirs down; 'twas time I should present<br/>        The victor's crown, but... there, 'twill last<br/>No long time... the old mist again<br/>Blinds me as then it did. How vain!<br/><br/>See!  Gismond's at the gate, in talk<br/>        With his two boys: I can proceed.<br/>Well, at that moment, who should stalk<br/>        Forth boldly--to my face, indeed--<br/>But Gauthier, and he thundered "Stay!"<br/>And all stayed.  "Bring no crowns, I say!"<br/><br/>"Bring torches! Wind the penance-sheet<br/>        About her!  Let her shun the chaste,<br/>Or lay herself before their feet!<br/>        Shall she whose body I embraced<br/>A night long, queen it in the day?<br/>For honour's sake no crowns, I say!"<br/><br/>I?  What I answered?  As I live,<br/>        I never fancied such a thing<br/>As answer possible to give.<br/>        What says the body when they spring<br/>Some monstrous torture-engine's whole<br/>Strength on it?  No more says the soul.<br/><br/>Till out strode Gismond; then I knew<br/>        That I was saved. I never met<br/>His face before, but, at first view,<br/>        I felt quite sure that God had set<br/>Himself to Satan; who would spend<br/>A minute's mistrust on the end?<br/><br/>He strode to Gauthier, in his throat<br/>        Gave him the lie, then struck his mouth<br/>With one back-handed blow that wrote<br/>        In blood men's verdict there.  North, South,<br/>East, West, I looked. The lie was dead,<br/>And damned, and truth stood up instead.<br/><br/>This glads me most, that I enjoyed<br/>        The heart of the joy, with my content<br/>In watching Gismond unalloyed<br/>        By any doubt of the event:<br/>God took that on him--I was bid<br/>Watch Gismond for my part: I did.<br/><br/>Did I not watch him while he let<br/>        His armourer just brace his greaves,<br/>Rivet his hauberk, on the fret<br/>        The while!  His foot... my memory leaves<br/>No least stamp out, nor how anon<br/>He pulled his ringing gauntlets on.<br/><br/>And e'en before the trumpet's sound<br/>        Was finished, prone lay the false knight,<br/>Prone as his lie, upon the ground:<br/>        Gismond flew at him, used no sleight<br/>O' the sword, but open-breasted drove,<br/>Cleaving till out the truth he clove.<br/><br/>Which done, he dragged him to my feet<br/>        And said "Here die, but end thy breath<br/>In full confession, lest thou fleet<br/>        From my first, to God's second death!<br/>Say, hast thou lied?"  And, "I have lied<br/>To God and her," he said, and died.<br/><br/>Then Gismond, kneeling to me, asked<br/>        What safe my heart holds, though no word<br/>Could I repeat now, if I tasked<br/>        My powers for ever, to a third<br/>Dear even as you are.  Pass the rest<br/>Until I sank upon his breast.<br/><br/>Over my head his arm he flung<br/>        Against the world; and scarce I felt<br/>His sword (that dripped by me and swung)<br/>        A little shifted in its belt:<br/>For he began to say the while<br/>How South our home lay many a mile.<br/><br/>So 'mid the shouting multitude<br/>        We two walked forth to never more<br/>Return.  My cousins have pursued<br/>        Their life, untroubled as before<br/>I vexed them.  Gauthier's dwelling-place<br/>God lighten!  May his soul find grace!<br/><br/>Our elder boy has got the clear<br/>        Great brow; tho' when his brother's black<br/>Full eye shows scorn, it... Gismond here?<br/>        And have you brought my tercel back?<br/>I just was telling Adela<br/>How many birds it struck since May.
