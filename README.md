# üíÆ Troilus and Criseyde: Book I by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    <br/>The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,<br/>That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,<br/>In lovinge, how his aventures fellen<br/>Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,<br/>My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye.<br/>Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte<br/>Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte!<br/><br/>To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,<br/>Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne;<br/>Help me, that am the sorwful instrument<br/>That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne!<br/>For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,<br/>A woful wight to han a drery fere,<br/>And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.<br/><br/>For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,<br/>Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse,<br/>Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,<br/>So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;<br/>But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse<br/>To any lover, and his cause avayle,<br/>Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle!<br/><br/>But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,<br/>If any drope of pitee in yow be,<br/>Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse<br/>That ye han felt, and on the adversitee<br/>Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye<br/>Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;<br/>Or ye han wonne hym with to greet an ese.<br/><br/>And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas<br/>Of Troilus, as ye may after here,<br/>That love hem bringe in hevene to solas,<br/>And eek for me preyeth to god so dere,<br/>That I have might to shewe, in som manere,<br/>Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,<br/>In Troilus unsely aventure.<br/><br/>And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred<br/>In love, that never nil recovered be,<br/>And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred<br/>Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;<br/>Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee,<br/>So graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,<br/>That been despeyred out of Loves grace.<br/><br/>And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,<br/>That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,<br/>And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,<br/>That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.<br/>For so hope I my soule best avaunce,<br/>To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be,<br/>And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee.<br/><br/>And for to have of hem compassioun<br/>As though I were hir owene brother dere.<br/>Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun,<br/>For now wol I gon streight to my matere,<br/>In whiche ye may the double sorwes here<br/>Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,<br/>And how that she forsook him er she deyde.<br/><br/>It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge<br/>In armes with a thousand shippes wente<br/>To Troyewardes, and the citee longe<br/>Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,<br/>And, in diverse wyse and oon entente,<br/>The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne,<br/>By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne.<br/><br/>Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was<br/>Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,<br/>A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas,<br/>That in science so expert was, that he<br/>Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be,<br/>By answere of his god, that highte thus,<br/>Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.<br/><br/>So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,<br/>And eek by answere of this Appollo,<br/>That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,<br/>Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do,<br/>He caste anoon out of the toun to go;<br/>For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde<br/>Destroyed ben, ye, wolde who-so nolde.<br/><br/>For which, for to departen softely<br/>Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse,<br/>And to the Grekes ost ful prively<br/>He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse,<br/>Hym deden bothe worship and servyse,<br/>In trust that he hath conning hem to rede<br/>In every peril which that is to drede.<br/><br/>The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed,<br/>Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken,<br/>That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed<br/>With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken<br/>On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;<br/>And seyden, he and al his kin at ones<br/>Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones.<br/><br/>Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,<br/>Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,<br/>His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,<br/>For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede,<br/>As she that niste what was best to rede;<br/>For bothe a widowe was she, and allone<br/>Of any freend to whom she dorste hir mone.<br/><br/>Criseyde was this lady name a-right;<br/>As to my dome, in al Troyes citee<br/>Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight<br/>So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee,<br/>That lyk a thing immortal semed she,<br/>As doth an hevenish parfit creature,<br/>That doun were sent in scorning of nature.<br/><br/>This lady, which that al-day herde at ere<br/>Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,<br/>Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,<br/>In widewes habit large of samit broun,<br/>On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun;<br/>With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge,<br/>His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge.<br/><br/>Now was this Ector pitous of nature,<br/>And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,<br/>And that she was so fair a creature;<br/>Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,<br/>And seyde, `Lat your fadres treson goon<br/>Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in Ioye,<br/>Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye.<br/><br/>`And al thonour that men may doon yow have,<br/>As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,<br/>Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,<br/>As fer as I may ought enquere or here.'<br/>And she him thonked with ful humble chere,<br/>And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,<br/>And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille.<br/><br/>And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee<br/>As to hir honour nede was to holde;<br/>And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee,<br/>Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde<br/>Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.<br/>But whether that she children hadde or noon,<br/>I rede it naught;
