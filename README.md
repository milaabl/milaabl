# üíÆ The Lime-tree Bower my Prison [Addressed to Charles Lamb, o by *Samuel Coleridge*

<p>
    Well, they are gone, and here must I remain,<br/>This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost<br/>Beauties and feelings, such as would have been<br/>Most sweet to my remembrance even when age<br/>Had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! They, meanwhile,<br/>Friends, whom I never more may meet again,<br/>On springy heath, along the hill-top edge,<br/>Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,<br/>To that still roaring dell, of which I told;<br/>The roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep,<br/>And only speckled by the mid-day sun;<br/>Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock<br/>Flings arching like a bridge;--that branchless ash,<br/>Unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves<br/>Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,<br/>Fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends<br/>Behold the dark green file of long lank weeds,<br/>That all at once (a most fantastic sight!)<br/>Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge<br/>Of the blue clay-stone.<br/><br/>Now, my friends emerge<br/>Beneath the wide wide Heaven--and view again<br/>The many-steepled tract magnificent<br/>Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea,<br/>With some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up<br/>The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two Isles<br/>Of purple shadow! Yes! they wander on<br/>In gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad,<br/>My gentle-hearted Charles! for thou hast pined<br/>And hunger'd after Nature, many a year,<br/>In the great City pent, winning thy way<br/>With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain<br/>And strange calamity! Ah! slowly sink<br/>Behind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun!<br/>Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,<br/>Ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds!<br/>Live in the yellow light, ye distant groves!<br/>And kindle, thou blue Ocean! So my friend<br/>Struck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood,<br/>Silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round<br/>On the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem<br/>Less gross than bodily; and of such hues<br/>As veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes<br/>Spirits perceive his presence.<br/><br/>A delight<br/>Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad<br/>As I myself were there! Nor in this bower,<br/>This little lime-tree bower, have I not mark'd<br/>Much that has sooth'd me. Pale beneath the blaze<br/>Hung the transparent foliage; and I watch'd<br/>Some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see<br/>The shadow of the leaf and stem above<br/>Dappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree<br/>Was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay<br/>Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps<br/>Those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass<br/>Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue<br/>Through the late twilight: and though now the bat<br/>Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,<br/>Yet still the solitary humble-bee<br/>Sings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know<br/>That Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure;<br/>No plot so narrow, be but Nature there,<br/>No waste so vacant, but may well employ<br/>Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart<br/>Awake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes<br/>'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good,<br/>That we may lift the soul, and contemplate<br/>With lively joy the joys we cannot share.<br/>My gentle-hearted Charles! when the last rook<br/>Beat its straight path along the dusky air<br/>Homewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing<br/>(Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light)<br/>Had cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory,<br/>While thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still,<br/>Flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm<br/>For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom<br/>No sound is dissonant which tells of Life.
