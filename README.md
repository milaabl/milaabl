# üíÆ To E. Fitzgerald: Tiresias by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    OLD FITZ, who from your suburb grange,<br/>Where once I tarried for a while,<br/>Glance at the wheeling orb of change,<br/>And greet it with a kindly smile;<br/>Whom yet I see as there you sit<br/>Beneath your sheltering garden-tree,<br/>And watch your doves about you flit,<br/>And plant on shoulder, hand, and knee,<br/>Or on your head their rosy feet,<br/>As if they knew your diet spares<br/>Whatever moved in that full sheet<br/>Let down to Peter at his prayers;<br/>Who live on milk and meal and grass;<br/>And once for ten long weeks I tried<br/>Your table of Pythagoras,<br/>- And seem'd at first "a thing enskied,"<br/>As Shakespeare has it, airy-light<br/>To float above the ways of men,<br/>Then fell from that half-spiritual height<br/>Chill'd, till I tasted flesh again<br/>One night when earth was winter-b]ack,<br/>And all the heavens flash'd in frost;<br/>And on me, half-asleep, came back<br/>That wholesome heat the blood had lost,<br/>And set me climbing icy capes<br/>And glaciers, over which there roll'd<br/>To meet me long-arm'd vines with grapes<br/>Of Eshcol hugeness- for the cold<br/>Without, and warmth within me, wrought<br/>To mould the dream; but none can say<br/>That Lenten fare makes Lenten thought<br/>Who reads your golden Eastern lay,<br/>Than which I know no version done<br/>In English more divinely well;<br/>A planet equal to the sun<br/>Which cast it, that large infidel<br/>Your Omar, and your Omar drew<br/>Full-handed plaudits from our best<br/>In modern letters, and from two,<br/>Old friends outvaluing all the rest,<br/>Two voices heard on earth no more;<br/>But we old friends are still alive,<br/>And I am nearing seventy-four,<br/>While you have touch'd at seventy-five,<br/>And so I send a birthday line<br/>Of greeting; and my son, who dipt<br/>In some forgotten book of mine<br/>With sallow scraps of manuscript,<br/>And dating many a year ago,<br/>Has hit on this, which you will take,<br/>My Fitz, and welcome, as I know,<br/>Less for its own than for the sake<br/>Of one recalling gracious times,<br/>When, in our younger London days,<br/>You found some merit in my rhymes,<br/>And I more pleasure in your praise.<br/><br/>TIRESIAS<br/><br/>I WISH I were as in the years of old<br/>While yet the blessed daylight made itself<br/>Ruddy thro' both the roofs of sight, and woke<br/>These eyes, now dull, but then so keen to seek<br/>The meanings ambush'd under all they saw,<br/>The flight of birds, the flame of sacrifice,<br/>What omens may foreshadow fate to man<br/>And woman, and the secret of the Gods.<br/>My son, the Gods, despite of human prayer,<br/>Are slower to forgive than human kings.<br/>The great God Ares burns in anger still<br/><br/>Against the guiltless heirs of him from Tyre<br/>Our Cadmus, out of whom thou art, who found<br/>Beside the springs of Dirce, smote, and still'd<br/>Thro' all its folds the multitudinous beast<br/>The dragon, which our trembling fathers call'd<br/>The God's own son.<br/>A tale, that told to me,<br/>When but thine age, by age as winter-white<br/>As mine is now, amazed, but made me yearn<br/>For larger glimpses of that more than man<br/>Which rolls the heavens, and lifts and lays the deep,<br/>Yet loves and hates with mortal hates and loves,<br/>And moves unseen among the ways of men.<br/>Then, in my wanderings all the lands that lie<br/>Subjected to the Heliconian ridge<br/>Have heard this footstep fall, altho' my wont<br/>Was more to scale the highest of the heights<br/>With some strange hope to see the nearer God.<br/>One naked peak‚Äπthe sister of the Sun<br/>Would climb from out the dark, and linger there<br/><br/><br/>To silver all the valleys with her shafts‚Äπ<br/>There once, but long ago, five-fold thy term<br/>Of years, I lay; the winds were dead for heat-<br/>The noonday crag made the hand burn; and sick<br/>For shadow‚Äπnot one bush was near‚ÄπI rose<br/>Following a torrent till its myriad falls<br/>Found silence in the hollows underneath.<br/>There in a secret olive-glade I saw<br/>Pallas Athene climbing from the bath<br/>In anger; yet one glittering foot disturb'd<br/>The lucid well; one snowy knee was prest<br/>Against the margin flowers; a dreadful light<br/>Came from her golden hair, her golden helm<br/>And all her golden armor on the grass,<br/>And from her virgin breast, and virgin eyes<br/>Remaining fixt on mine, till mine grew dark<br/>For ever, and I heard a voice that said<br/>"Henceforth be blind, for thou hast seen too much,<br/>And speak the truth that no man may believe."<br/>Son, in the hidden world of sight that lives<br/>Behind this darkness, I behold her still<br/>Beyond all work of those who carve the stone<br/>Beyond all dreams of Godlike womanhood,<br/>Ineffable beauty, out of whom, at a glance<br/>And as it were, perforce, upon me flash'd<br/>The power of prophesying‚Äπbut to me<br/>No power so chain'd and coupled with the curse<br/>Of blindness and their unbelief who heard<br/>And heard not, when I spake of famine, plague<br/>Shrine-shattering earthquake, fire, flood, thunderbolt,<br/>And angers of the Gods for evil done<br/>And expiation lack'd‚Äπno power on Fate<br/>Theirs, or mine own! for when the crowd would roar<br/>For blood, for war, whose issue was their doom,<br/>To cast wise words among the multitude<br/>Was fiinging fruit to lions; nor, in hours<br/>Of civil outbreak, when I knew the twain<br/>Would each waste each, and bring on both the yoke<br/>Of stronger states, was mine the voice to curb<br/>The madness of our cities and their kings.<br/>Who ever turn'd upon his heel to hear<br/>My warning that the tyranny of one<br/>Was prelude to the tyranny of all?<br/>My counsel that the tyranny of all<br/>Led backward to the tyranny of one?<br/>This power hath work'd no good to aught that lives<br/>And these blind hands were useless in their wars.<br/>O. therefore, that the unfulfill'd desire,<br/>The grief for ever born from griefs to be<br/>The boundless yearning of the prophet's heart‚Äπ<br/>Could that stand forth, and like a statue, rear'd<br/>To some great citizen, wim all praise from all<br/>Who past it, saying, "That was he!"<br/>In vain!<br/>Virtue must shape itself im deed, and those<br/>Whom weakness or necessity have cramp'd<br/>Withm themselves, immerging, each, his urn<br/>In his own well, draws solace as he may.<br/>Menceceus, thou hast eyes, and I can hear<br/>Too plainly what full tides of onset sap<br/>Our seven high gates, and what a weight of war<br/>Rides on those ringing axlesl jingle of bits,<br/>Shouts, arrows, tramp of the horn-footed horse<br/>That grind the glebe to powder! Stony showers<br/>Of that ear-stunning hail of Ares crash<br/>Along the sounding walls. Above, below<br/>Shock after shock, the song-built towers and gates<br/>Reel, bruised and butted with the shuddering<br/>War-thunder of iron rams; and from within<br/>The city comes a murmur void of joy,<br/>Lest she be taken captive‚Äπmaidens, wives,<br/>And mothers with their babblers of the dawn,<br/>And oldest age in shadow from the night,<br/>Falling about their shrines before their Gods,<br/>And wailing, "Save us."<br/><br/>And they wail to thee!<br/>These eyeless eyes, that cannot see thine own,<br/>See this, that only in thy virtue lies<br/>The saving of our Thebes; for, yesternight,<br/>To me, the great God Ares, whose one bliss<br/>Is war and human sacrifice‚Äπhimself<br/>Blood-red from battle, spear and helmet tipt<br/>With stormy light as on a mast at sea,<br/>Stood out before a darkness, crying, "Thebes,<br/>Thy Thebes shall fall and perish, for I loathe<br/>The seed of Cadmus‚Äπyet if one of these<br/>By his own hand‚Äπif one of these‚Äπ"<br/>My son, No sound is breathed so potent to coerce,<br/>And to conciliate, as their names who dare<br/>For that sweet mother land which gave them birth<br/>Nobly to do, nobly to die. Their names,<br/>Graven on memorial columns, are a song<br/>Heard in the future; few, but more than wall<br/>And rampart, their examples reach a hand<br/>Far thro' all years, and everywhere they meet<br/>And kindle generous purpose, and the strength<br/>To mould it into action pure as theirs.<br/>Fairer thy fate than mine, if life's best end<br/>Be to end well! and thou refusing this,<br/>Unvenerable will thy memory be<br/>While men shall move the lips; but if thou dare‚Äπ<br/>Thou, one of these, the race of Cadmus‚Äπthen<br/>No stone is fitted in yon marble girth<br/>Whose echo shall not tongue thy glorious doom,<br/>Nor in this pavement but shall ring thy name<br/>To every hoof that clangs it, and the springs<br/>Of Dirce laving yonder battle-plain,<br/>Heard from the roofs by night, will murmur thee<br/>To thine own Thebes, while Thebes thro' thee shall stand<br/>Firm-based with all her Gods.<br/>The Dragon's cave<br/>Half hid, they tell me, now in flowing vines‚Äπ<br/>Where once he dwelt and whence he roll'd himself<br/>At dead of night‚Äπthou knowest, and that smooth rock<br/>Before it, altar-fashion'd, where of late<br/>The woman-breasted Sphinx, with wings drawn back<br/>Folded her lion paws, and look'd to Thebes.<br/>There blanch the bones of whom she slew, and these<br/>Mixt with her own, because the fierce beast found<br/>A wiser than herself, and dash'd herself<br/>Dead in her rage; but thou art wise enough<br/>Tho' young, to love thy wiser, blunt the curse<br/>Of Pallas, bear, and tho' I speak the truth<br/>Believe I speak it, let thine own hand strike<br/>Thy youthful pulses into rest and quench<br/>The red God's anger, fearing not to plunge<br/>Thy torch of life in darkness, rather thou<br/>Rejoicing that the sun, the moon, the stars<br/>Send no such light upon the ways of men<br/>As one great deed.<br/>Thither, my son, and there<br/>Thou, that hast never known the embrace of love<br/>Offer thy maiden life.<br/>This useless hand!<br/>I felt one warm tear fall upon it. Gone!<br/>He will achieve his greatness.<br/>But for me I would that I were gather'd to my rest,<br/>And mingled with the famous kings of old<br/>On whom about their ocean-islets flash<br/>The faces of the Gods‚Äπthe wise man's word<br/>Here trampled by the populace underfoot<br/>There crown'd with worship and these eyes will find<br/>The men I knew, and watch the chariot whirl<br/>About the goal again, and hunters race<br/>The shadowy lion, and the warrior-kings<br/>In height and prowess more than human, strive<br/>Again for glory, while the golden lyre<br/>Is ever sounding in heroic ears<br/>Heroic hymns, and every way the vales<br/>Wind, clouded with the grateful incense-fume<br/>Of those who mix all odor to the Gods<br/>On one far height in one far-shining fire.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>"One height and one far-shining fire!"<br/>And while I fancied that my friend<br/>For this brief idyll would require<br/>A less diffuse and opulent end,<br/>And would defend his judgment well,<br/>If I should deem it over nice‚Äπ<br/>The tolling of his funeral bell<br/>Broke on my Pagan Paradise,<br/>And mixt the dream of classic times,<br/>And all the phantoms of the dream,<br/>With present grief, and made the rhymes,<br/>That miss'd his living welcome, seem<br/>Like would-be guests an hour too late,<br/>Who down the highway moving on<br/>With easy laughter find the gate<br/>Is bolted, and the master gone.<br/>Gone onto darkness, that full light<br/>Of friendship! past, in sleep, away<br/>By night, into the deeper night!<br/>The deeper night? A clearer day<br/>Than our poor twilight dawn on earth‚Äπ<br/>If night, what barren toil to be!<br/>What life, so maim'd by night, were worth<br/>Our living out? Not mine to me<br/>Remembering all the golden hours<br/>Now silent, and so many dead,<br/>And him the last; and laying flowers,<br/>This wreath, above his honor'd head,<br/>And praying that, when I from hence<br/>Shall fade with him into the unknown,<br/>My close of earth's experience<br/>May prove as peaceful as his own.
