# üíÆ Atalanta's Race by *William Morris*

<p>
    Through thick Arcadian woods a hunter went,<br/>Following the beasts upon a fresh spring day;<br/>But since his horn-tipped bow but seldom bent,<br/>Now at the noontide nought had happed to slay,<br/>Within a vale he called his hounds away,<br/>Hearkening the echoes of his lone voice cling<br/>About the cliffs and through the beech-trees ring.<br/><br/>But when they ended, still awhile he stood,<br/>And but the sweet familiar thrush could hear,<br/>And all the day-long noises of the wood,<br/>And o'er the dry leaves of the vanished year<br/>His hounds' feet pattering as they drew anear,<br/>And heavy breathing from their heads low hung,<br/>To see the mighty corner bow unstrung.<br/><br/>Then smiling did he turn to leave the place,<br/>But with his first step some new fleeting thought<br/>A shadow cast across his sun-burnt face;<br/>I think the golden net that April brought<br/>From some warm world his wavering soul had caught;<br/>For, sunk in vague sweet longing, did he go<br/>Betwixt the trees with doubtful steps and slow.<br/><br/>Yet howsoever slow he went, at last<br/>The trees grew sparser, and the wood was done;<br/>Whereon one farewell backward look he cast,<br/>Then, turning round to see what place was won,<br/>With shaded eyes looked underneath the sun,<br/>And o'er green meads and new-turned furrows brown<br/>Beheld the gleaming of King Sch≈ìneus' town.<br/><br/>So thitherward he turned, and on each side<br/>The folk were busy on the teeming land,<br/>And man and maid from the brown furrows cried,<br/>Or midst the newly blossomed vines did stand,<br/>And as the rustic weapon pressed the hand<br/>Thought of the nodding of the well-filled ear,<br/>Or how the knife the heavy bunch should shear.<br/><br/>Merry it was: about him sung the birds,<br/>The spring flowers bloomed along the firm dry road,<br/>The sleek-skinned mothers of the sharp-horned herds<br/>Now for the barefoot milking-maidens lowed;<br/>While from the freshness of his blue abode,<br/>Glad his death-bearing arrows to forget,<br/>The broad sun blazed, nor scattered plagues as yet.<br/><br/>Through such fair things unto the gates he came,<br/>And found them open, as though peace were there;<br/>Wherethrough, unquestioned of his race or name,<br/>He entered, and along the streets 'gan fare,<br/>Which at the first of folk were well-nigh bare;<br/>But pressing on, and going more hastily,<br/><br/>Men hurrying too he 'gan at last to see.<br/>Following the last of these he still pressed on,<br/>Until an open space he came unto,<br/>Where wreaths of fame had oft been lost and won,<br/>For feats of strength folks there were wont to do.<br/>And now our hunter looked for something new,<br/>Because the whole wide space was bare, and stilled<br/>The high seats were, with eager people filled.<br/><br/>There with the others to a seat he gat,<br/>Whence he beheld a broidered canopy,<br/>'Neath which in fair array King Sch≈ìneus sat<br/>Upon his throne with councillors thereby;<br/>And underneath his well-wrought seat and high,<br/>He saw a golden image of the sun,<br/>A silver image of the Fleet-foot One.<br/><br/>A brazen altar stood beneath their feet<br/>Whereon a thin flame flicker'd in the wind;<br/>Nigh this a herald clad in raiment meet<br/>Made ready even now his horn to wind,<br/>By whom a huge man held a sword, entwin'd<br/>With yellow flowers; these stood a little space<br/>From off the altar, nigh the starting place.<br/><br/>And there two runners did the sign abide,<br/>Foot set to foot,--a young man slim and fair,<br/>Crisp-hair'd, well knit, with firm limbs often tried<br/>In places where no man his strength may spare:<br/>Dainty his thin coat was, and on his hair.<br/>A golden circlet of renown he wore,<br/>And in his hand an olive garland bore.<br/><br/>But on this day with whom shall he contend?<br/>A maid stood by him like Diana clad<br/>When in the woods she lists her bow to bend,<br/>Too fair for one to look on and be glad,<br/>Who scarcely yet has thirty summers had,<br/>If he must still behold her from afar;<br/>Too fair to let the world live free from war.<br/><br/>She seem'd all earthly matters to forget;<br/>Of all tormenting lines her face was clear;<br/>Her wide gray eyes upon the goal were set<br/>Calm and unmov'd as though no soul were near.<br/>But her foe trembled as a man in fear,<br/>Nor from her loveliness one moment turn'd<br/>His anxious face with fierce desire that burn'd.<br/><br/>Now through the hush there broke the trumpet's clang<br/>Just as the setting sun made eventide.<br/>Then from light feet a spurt of dust there sprang,<br/>And swiftly were they running side by side;<br/>But silent did the thronging folk abide<br/>Until the turning-post was reach'd at last,<br/>And round about it still abreast they passed.<br/><br/>But when the people saw how close they ran,<br/>When half-way to the starting-point they were,<br/>A cry of joy broke forth, whereat the man<br/>Headed the white-foot runner, and drew near<br/>Unto the very end of all his fear;<br/>And scarce his straining feet the ground could feel,<br/>And bliss unhop'd for o'er his heart 'gan steal.<br/><br/>But 'midst the loud victorious shouts he heard<br/>Her footsteps drawing nearer, and the sound<br/>Of fluttering raiment, and thereat afeard<br/>His flush'd and eager face he turn'd around,<br/>And even then he felt her past him bound<br/>Fleet as the wind, but scarcely saw her there<br/>Till on the goal she laid her fingers fair.<br/><br/>There stood she breathing like a little child<br/>Amid some warlike clamour laid asleep,<br/>For no victorious joy her red lips smil'd,<br/>Her cheek its wonted freshness did but keep;<br/>No glance lit up her clear gray eyes and deep,<br/>Though some divine thought soften'd all her face<br/>As once more rang the trumpet through the place.<br/><br/>But her late foe stopp'd short amidst his course,<br/>One moment gaz'd upon her piteously.<br/>Then with a groan his lingering feet did force<br/>To leave the spot whence he her eyes could see;<br/>And, changed like one who knows his time must be<br/>But short and bitter, without any word<br/>He knelt before the bearer of the sword;<br/><br/>Then high rose up the gleaming deadly blade,<br/>Bar'd of its flowers, and through the crowded place<br/>Was silence now, and midst of it the maid<br/>Went by the poor wretch at a gentle pace,<br/>And he to hers upturn'd his sad white face;<br/>Nor did his eyes behold another sight<br/>Ere on his soul there fell eternal light.<br/><br/>So was the pageant ended, and all folk<br/>Talking of this and that familiar thing<br/>In little groups from that sad concourse broke,<br/>For now the shrill bats were upon the wing,<br/>And soon dark night would slay the evening,<br/>And in dark gardens sang the nightingale<br/>Her little-heeded, oft-repeated tale.<br/><br/>And with the last of all the hunter went,<br/>Who, wondering at the strange sight he had seen,<br/>Prayed an old man to tell him what it meant,<br/>Both why the vanquished man so slain had been,<br/>And if the maiden were an earthly queen,<br/>Or rather what much more she seemed to be,<br/>No sharer in this world's mortality.<br/><br/>"Stranger," said he, "I pray she soon may die<br/>Whose lovely youth has slain so many an one!<br/>King Sch≈ìneus' daughter is she verily,<br/>Who when her eyes first looked upon the sun<br/>Was fain to end her life but new begun,<br/>For he had vowed to leave but men alone<br/>Sprung from his loins when he from earth was gone.<br/><br/>"Therefore he bade one leave her in the wood,<br/>And let wild things deal with her as they might,<br/>But this being done, some cruel god thought good<br/>To save her beauty in the world's despite;<br/>Folk say that her, so delicate and white<br/>As now she is, a rough root-grubbing bear<br/>Amidst her shapeless cubs at first did rear.<br/><br/>"In course of time the woodfolk slew her nurse,<br/>And to their rude abode the youngling brought,<br/>And reared her up to be a kingdom's curse;<br/>Who grown a woman, of no kingdom thought,<br/>But armed and swift, 'mid beasts destruction wrought,<br/>Nor spared two shaggy centaur kings to slay<br/>To whom her body seemed an easy prey.<br/><br/>"So to this city, led by fate, she came<br/>Whom known by signs, whereof I cannot tell,<br/>King Sch≈ìneus for his child at last did claim.<br/>Nor otherwhere since that day doth she dwell<br/>Sending too many a noble soul to hell--<br/>What! shine eyes glisten! what then, thinkest thou<br/>Her shining head unto the yoke to bow?<br/><br/>"Listen, my son, and love some other maid<br/>For she the saffron gown will never wear,<br/>And on no flower-strewn couch shall she be laid,<br/>Nor shall her voice make glad a lover's ear:<br/>Yet if of Death thou hast not any fear,<br/>Yea, rather, if thou lov'st her utterly,<br/>Thou still may'st woo her ere thou com'st to die,<br/><br/>"Like him that on this day thou sawest lie dead;<br/>For fearing as I deem the sea-born one;<br/>The maid has vowed e'en such a man to wed<br/>As in the course her swift feet can outrun,<br/>But whoso fails herein, his days are done:<br/>He came the nighest that was slain to-day,<br/>Although with him I deem she did but play.<br/><br/>"Behold, such mercy Atalanta gives<br/>To those that long to win her loveliness;<br/>Be wise! be sure that many a maid there lives<br/>Gentler than she, of beauty little less,<br/>Whose swimming eyes thy loving words shall bless,<br/>When in some garden, knee set close to knee,<br/>Thou sing'st the song that love may teach to thee."<br/><br/>So to the hunter spake that ancient man,<br/>And left him for his own home presently:<br/>But he turned round, and through the moonlight wan<br/>Reached the thick wood, and there 'twixt tree and tree<br/>Distraught he passed the long night feverishly,<br/>'Twixt sleep and waking, and at dawn arose<br/>To wage hot war against his speechless foes.<br/><br/>There to the hart's flank seemed his shaft to grow,<br/>As panting down the broad green glades he flew,<br/>There by his horn the Dryads well might know<br/>His thrust against the bear's heart had been true,<br/>And there Adonis' bane his javelin slew,<br/>But still in vain through rough and smooth he went,<br/>For none the more his restlessness was spent.<br/><br/>So wandering, he to Argive cities came,<br/>And in the lists with valiant men he stood,<br/>And by great deeds he won him praise and fame,<br/>And heaps of wealth for little-valued blood;<br/>But none of all these things, or life, seemed good<br/>Unto his heart, where still unsatisfied<br/>A ravenous longing warred with fear and pride.<br/><br/>Therefore it happed when but a month had gone<br/>Since he had left King Sch≈ìneus' city old,<br/>In hunting-gear again, again alone<br/>The forest-bordered meads did he behold,<br/>Where still mid thoughts of August's quivering gold<br/>Folk hoed the wheat, and clipped the vine in trust<br/>Of faint October's purple-foaming must.<br/><br/>And once again he passed the peaceful gate,<br/>While to his beating heart his lips did lie,<br/>That owning not victorious love and fate,<br/>Said, half aloud, "And here too must I try,<br/>To win of alien men the mastery,<br/>And gather for my head fresh meed of fame<br/>And cast new glory on my father's name."<br/><br/>In spite of that, how beat his heart, when first<br/>Folk said to him, "And art thou come to see<br/>That which still makes our city's name accurst<br/>Among all mothers for its cruelty?<br/>Then know indeed that fate is good to thee<br/>Because to-morrow a new luckless one<br/>Against the white-foot maid is pledged to run."<br/><br/>So on the morrow with no curious eyes<br/>As once he did, that piteous sight he saw,<br/>Nor did that wonder in his heart arise<br/>As toward the goal the conquering maid 'gan draw,<br/>Nor did he gaze upon her eyes with awe,<br/>Too full the pain of longing filled his heart<br/>For fear or wonder there to have a part.<br/><br/>But O, how long the night was ere it went!<br/>How long it was before the dawn begun<br/>Showed to the wakening birds the sun's intent<br/>That not in darkness should the world be done!<br/>And then, and then, how long before the sun<br/>Bade silently the toilers of the earth<br/>Get forth to fruitless cares or empty mirth!<br/><br/>And long it seemed that in the market-place<br/>He stood and saw the chaffering folk go by,<br/>Ere from the ivory throne King Sch≈ìneus' face<br/>Looked down upon the murmur royally,<br/>But then came trembling that the time was nigh<br/>When he midst pitying looks his love must claim,<br/>And jeering voices must salute his name.<br/><br/>But as the throng he pierced to gain the throne,<br/>His alien face distraught and anxious told<br/>What hopeless errand he was bound upon,<br/>And, each to each, folk whispered to behold<br/>His godlike limbs; nay, and one woman old<br/>As he went by must pluck him by the sleeve<br/>And pray him yet that wretched love to leave.<br/><br/>For sidling up she said, "Canst thou live twice,<br/>Fair son? canst thou have joyful youth again,<br/>That thus thou goest to the sacrifice<br/>Thyself the victim? nay then, all in vain<br/>Thy mother bore her longing and her pain,<br/>And one more maiden on the earth must dwell<br/>Hopeless of joy, nor fearing death and hell.<br/><br/>"O, fool, thou knowest not the compact then<br/>That with the three-formed goddess she has made<br/>To keep her from the loving lips of men,<br/>And in no saffron gown to be arrayed,<br/>And therewithal with glory to be paid,<br/>And love of her the moonlit river sees<br/>White 'gainst the shadow of the formless trees.<br/><br/>"Come back, and I myself will pray for thee<br/>Unto the sea-born framer of delights,<br/>To give thee her who on the earth may be<br/>The fairest stirrer up to death and fights,<br/>To quench with hopeful days and joyous nights<br/>The flame that doth thy youthful heart consume:<br/>Come back, nor give thy beauty to the tomb."<br/><br/>How should he listen to her earnest speech?<br/>Words, such as he not once or twice had said<br/>Unto himself, whose meaning scarce could reach<br/>The firm abode of that sad hardihead--<br/>He turned about, and through the marketstead<br/>Swiftly he passed, until before the throne<br/>In the cleared space he stood at last alone.<br/><br/>Then said the King, "Stranger, what dost thou here?<br/>Have any of my folk done ill to thee?<br/>Or art thou of the forest men in fear?<br/>Or art thou of the sad fraternity<br/>Who still will strive my daughter's mates to be,<br/>Staking their lives to win an earthly bliss,<br/>The lonely maid, the friend of Artemis?"<br/><br/>"O King," he said, "thou sayest the word indeed;<br/>Nor will I quit the strife till I have won<br/>My sweet delight, or death to end my need.<br/>And know that I am called Milanion,<br/>Of King Amphidamas the well-loved son:<br/>So fear not that to thy old name, O King,<br/>Much loss or shame my victory will bring."<br/><br/>"Nay, Prince," said Sch≈ìneus, "welcome to this land<br/>Thou wert indeed, if thou wert here to try<br/>Thy strength 'gainst some one mighty of his hand;<br/>Nor would we grudge thee well-won mastery.<br/>But now, why wilt thou come to me to die,<br/>And at my door lay down thy luckless head,<br/>Swelling the band of the unhappy dead,<br/><br/>"Whose curses even now my heart doth fear?<br/>Lo, I am old, and know what life can be,<br/>And what a bitter thing is death anear.<br/>O, Son! be wise, and harken unto me,<br/>And if no other can be dear to thee,<br/>At least as now, yet is the world full wide,<br/>And bliss in seeming hopeless hearts may hide:<br/><br/>"But if thou losest life, then all is lost."<br/>"Nay, King," Milanion said, "thy words are vain.<br/>Doubt not that I have counted well the cost.<br/>But say, on what day wilt thou that I gain<br/>Fulfilled delight, or death to end my pain.<br/>Right glad were I if it could be to-day,<br/>And all my doubts at rest for ever lay."<br/><br/>"Nay," said King Sch≈ìneus, "thus it shall not be,<br/>But rather shalt thou let a month go by,<br/>And weary with thy prayers for victory<br/>What god thou know'st the kindest and most nigh.<br/>So doing, still perchance thou shalt not die:<br/>And with my goodwill wouldst thou have the maid,<br/>For of the equal gods I grow afraid.<br/><br/>"And until then, O Prince, be thou my guest, .<br/>And all these troublous things awhile forget."<br/>"Nay," said he, "couldst thou give my soul good rest,<br/>And on mine head a sleepy garland set,<br/>Then had I 'scaped the meshes of the net,<br/>Nor should thou hear from me another word;<br/>But now, make sharp thy fearful heading-sword.<br/><br/>"Yet will I do what son of man may do,<br/>And promise all the gods may most desire,<br/>That to myself I may at least be true;<br/>And on that day my heart and limbs so tire,<br/>With utmost strain and measureless desire,<br/>That, at the worst, I may but fall asleep<br/>When in the sunlight round that sword shall sweep. "<br/><br/>He went therewith, nor anywhere would bide,<br/>But unto Argos restlessly did wend;<br/>And there, as one who lays all hope aside,<br/>Because the leech has said his life must end,<br/>Silent farewell he bade to foe and friend,<br/>And took his way unto the restless sea,<br/>For there he deemed his rest and help might be.<br/><br/>Upon the shore of Argolis there stands<br/>A temple to the goddess that he sought,<br/>That, turned unto the lion-bearing lands,<br/>Fenced from the east, of cold winds hath no thought,<br/>Though to no homestead there the sheaves are brought,<br/>No groaning press torments the close-clipped murk,<br/>Lonely the fane stands, far from all men's work.<br/><br/>Pass through a close, set thick with myrtle-trees,<br/>Through the brass doors that guard the holy place,<br/>And entering, hear the washing of the seas<br/>That twice a-day rise high above the base,<br/>And with the south-west urging them, embrace<br/>The marble feet of her that standeth there<br/>That shrink not, naked though they be and fair.<br/><br/>Small is the fane through which the sea-wind sings<br/>About Queen Venus' well-wrought image white,<br/>But hung around are many precious things,<br/>The gifts of those who, longing for delight,<br/>Have hung them there within the goddess' sight,<br/>And in return have taken at her hands<br/>The living treasures of the Grecian lands.<br/><br/>And thither now has come Milanion,<br/>And showed unto the priests' wide open eyes<br/>Gifts fairer than all those that there have shone,<br/>Silk cloths, inwrought with Indian fantasies,<br/>And bowls inscribed with sayings of the wise<br/>Above the deeds of foolish living things;<br/>And mirrors fit to be the gifts of kings.<br/><br/>And now before the Sea-born One he stands,<br/>By the sweet veiling smoke made dim and soft,<br/>And while the incense trickles from his hands,<br/>And while the odorous smoke-wreaths hang aloft,<br/>Thus doth he pray to her: "O Thou, who oft<br/>Hast holpen man and maid in their distress<br/>Despise me not for this my wretchedness!<br/><br/>"O goddess, among us who dwelt below,<br/>Kings and great men, great for a little while,<br/>Have pity on the lowly heads that bow,<br/>Nor hate the hearts that love them without guile;<br/>Wilt thou be worse than these, and is thy smile<br/>A vain device of him who set thee here,<br/>An empty dream of some artificer?<br/><br/>"O great one, some men love, and are ashamed;<br/>Some men are weary of the bonds of love;<br/>Yea, and by some men lightly art thou blamed,<br/>That from thy toils their lives they cannot move,<br/>And 'mid the ranks of men their manhood prove.<br/>Alas! O goddess, if thou slayest me,<br/>What new immortal can I serve but thee?<br/><br/>"Think then, will it bring honour to thy head<br/>If folk say, 'Everything aside he cast<br/>And to all fame and honour was he dead,<br/>And to his one hope now is dead at last,<br/>Since all unholpen he is gone and past;<br/>Ah, the gods love not man, for certainly,<br/>He to his helper did not cease to cry.'<br/><br/>"Nay, but thou wilt help; they who died before<br/>Not single-hearted as I deem came here,<br/>Therefore unthanked they laid their gifts before<br/>Thy stainless feet, still shivering with their fear,<br/>Lest in their eyes their true thought might appear,<br/>Who sought to be the lords of that fair town,<br/>Dreaded of men and winners of renown.<br/><br/>"O Queen, thou knowest I pray not for this:<br/>O set us down together in some place<br/>Where not a voice can break our heaven of bliss,<br/>Where nought but rocks and I can see her face,<br/>Softening beneath the marvel of thy grace,<br/>Where not a foot our vanished steps can track--<br/>The golden age, the golden age come back!<br/><br/>"O fairest, hear me now who do thy will,<br/>Plead for thy rebel that she be not slain,<br/>But live and love and be thy servant still;<br/>Ah, give her joy and take away my pain,<br/>And thus two long-enduring servants gain.<br/>An easy thing this is to do for me,<br/>What need of my vain words to weary thee.<br/><br/>"But none the less, this place will I not leave<br/>Until I needs must go my death to meet,<br/>Or at thy hands some happy sign receive<br/>That in great joy we twain may one day greet<br/>Thy presence here and kiss thy silver feet,<br/>Such as we deem thee, fair beyond all words,<br/>Victorious o'er our servants and our lords."<br/><br/>Then from the altar back a space he drew,<br/>But from the Queen turned not his face away,<br/>But 'gainst a pillar leaned, until the blue<br/>That arched the sky, at ending of the day,<br/>Was turned to ruddy gold and changing gray,<br/>And clear, but low, the nigh-ebbed windless sea<br/>In the still evening murmured ceaselessly.<br/><br/>And there he stood when all the sun was down,<br/>Nor had he moved, when the dim golden light,<br/>Like the fair lustre of a godlike town,<br/>Had left the world to seeming hopeless night,<br/>Nor would he move the more when wan moonlight<br/>Streamed through the pillows for a little while,<br/>And lighted up the white Queen's changeless smile.<br/><br/>Nought noted he the shallow-flowing sea<br/>As step by step it set the wrack a-swim;<br/>The yellow torchlight nothing noted he<br/>Wherein with fluttering gown and half-bared limb<br/>The temple damsels sung their midnight hymn;<br/>And nought the doubled stillness of the fane<br/>When they were gone and all was hushed again.<br/><br/>But when the waves had touched the marble base,<br/>And steps the fish swim over twice a-day,<br/>The dawn beheld him sunken in his place<br/>Upon the floor; and sleeping there he lay,<br/>Not heeding aught the little jets of spray<br/>The roughened sea brought nigh, across him cast,<br/>For as one dead all thought from him had passed.<br/><br/>Yet long before the sun had showed his head,<br/>Long ere the varied hangings on the wall<br/>Had gained once more their blue and green and red,<br/>He rose as one some well-known sign doth call<br/>When war upon the city's gates doth fall,<br/>And scarce like one fresh risen out of sleep,<br/>He 'gan again his broken watch to keep.<br/><br/>Then he turned round; not for the sea-gull's cry<br/>That wheeled above the temple in his flight,<br/>Not for the fresh south wind that lovingly<br/>Breathed on the new-born day and dying night,<br/>But some strange hope 'twixt fear and great delight<br/>Drew round his face, now flushed, now pale and wan,<br/>And still constrained his eyes the sea to scan.<br/><br/>Now a faint light lit up the southern sky,<br/>Not sun or moon, for all the world was gray,<br/>But this a bright cloud seemed, that drew anigh,<br/>Lighting the dull waves that beneath it lay<br/>As toward the temple still it took its way,<br/>And still grew greater, till Milanion<br/>Saw nought for dazzling light that round him shone.<br/><br/>But as he staggered with his arms outspread,<br/>Delicious unnamed odours breathed around,<br/>For languid happiness he bowed his head,<br/>And with wet eyes sank down upon the ground,<br/>Nor wished for aught, nor any dream he found<br/>To give him reason for that happiness,<br/>Or make him ask more knowledge of his bliss.<br/><br/>At last his eyes were cleared, and he could see<br/>Through happy tears the goddess face to face<br/>With that faint image of Divinity,<br/>Whose well-wrought smile and dainty changeless grace<br/>Until that morn so gladdened all the place;<br/>Then, he unwitting cried aloud her name<br/>And covered up his eyes for fear and shame.<br/><br/>But through the stillness he her voice could hear<br/>Piercing his heart with joy scarce bearable,<br/>That said, "Milanion, wherefore dost thou fear,<br/>I am not hard to those who love me well;<br/>List to what I a second time will tell,<br/>And thou mayest hear perchance, and live to save<br/>The cruel maiden from a loveless grave.<br/><br/>"See, by my feet three golden apples lie--<br/>Such fruit among the heavy roses falls,<br/>Such fruit my watchful damsels carefully<br/>Store up within the best loved of my walls,<br/>Ancient Damascus, where the lover calls<br/>Above my unseen head, and faint and light<br/>The rose-leaves flutter round me in the night.<br/><br/>"And note, that these are not alone most fair<br/>With heavenly gold, but longing strange they bring<br/>Unto the hearts of men, who will not care<br/>Beholding these, for any once-loved thing<br/>Till round the shining sides their fingers cling.<br/>And thou shalt see thy well-girt swift-foot maid<br/>By sight of these amidst her glory stayed.<br/><br/>"For bearing these within a scrip with thee,<br/>When first she heads thee from the starting-place<br/>Cast down the first one for her eyes to see,<br/>And when she turns aside make on apace,<br/>And if again she heads thee in the race<br/>Spare not the other two to cast aside<br/>If she not long enough behind will bide.<br/><br/>"Farewell, and when has come the happy time<br/>That she Diana's raiment must unbind<br/>And all the world seems blessed with Saturn's clime,<br/>And thou with eager arms about her twined<br/>Beholdest first her gray eyes growing kind,<br/>Surely, O trembler, thou shalt scarcely then<br/>Forget the Helper of unhappy men."<br/><br/>Milanion raised his head at this last word<br/>For now so soft and kind she seemed to be<br/>No longer of her Godhead was he feared;<br/>Too late he looked; for nothing could he see<br/>But the white image glimmering doubtfully<br/>In the departing twilight cold and gray,<br/>And those three apples on the step that lay.<br/><br/>These then he caught up quivering with delight,<br/>Yet fearful lest it all might be a dream;<br/>And though aweary with the watchful night,<br/>And sleepless nights of longing, still did deem<br/>He could not sleep; but yet the first sunbeam<br/>That smote the fane across the heaving deep<br/>Shone on him laid in calm, untroubled sleep.<br/><br/>But little ere the noontide did he rise,<br/>And why he felt so happy scarce could tell<br/>Until the gleaming apples met his eyes.<br/>Then leaving the fair place where this befell<br/>Oft he looked back as one who loved it well,<br/>Then homeward to the haunts of men, 'gan wend<br/>To bring all things unto a happy end.<br/><br/>Now has the lingering month at last gone by,<br/>Again are all folk round the running place,<br/>Nor other seems the dismal pageantry<br/>Than heretofore, but that another face<br/>Looks o'er the smooth course ready for the race,<br/>For now, beheld of all, Milanion<br/>Stands on the spot he twice has looked upon.<br/><br/>But yet--what change is this that holds the maid?<br/>Does she indeed see in his glittering eye<br/>More than disdain of the sharp shearing blade,<br/>Some happy hope of help and victory?<br/>The others seem'd to say, "We come to die;<br/>Look down upon us for a little while,<br/>That, dead, we may bethink us of thy smile."<br/><br/>But he--what look of mastery was this<br/>He cast on her? why were his lips so red;<br/>Why was his face so flush'd with happiness?<br/>So looks not one who deems himself but dead,<br/>E'en if to death he bows a willing head;<br/>So rather looks a god well pleas'd to find<br/>Some earthly damsel fashion'd to his mind,<br/><br/>Why must she drop her lids before his gaze,<br/>And even as she casts adown her eyes<br/>Redden to note his eager glance of praise,<br/>And wish that she were clad in other guise?<br/>Why must the memory to her heart arise<br/>Of things unnoticed when they first were heard,<br/>Some lover's song, some answering maiden's word?<br/><br/>What makes these longings, vague--without a name,<br/>And this vain pity never felt before,<br/>This sudden languor, this contempt of fame,<br/>This tender sorrow for the time past o'er,<br/>These doubts that grow each minute more and more?<br/>Why does she tremble as the time grows near,<br/>And weak defeat and woeful victory fear?<br/><br/>But while she seem'd to hear her beating heart,<br/>Above their heads the trumpet blast rang out<br/>And forth they sprang, and she must play her part;<br/>Then flew her white feet, knowing not a doubt,<br/>Though, slackening once, she turn'd her head about,<br/>But then she cried aloud and faster fled<br/>Than e'er before, and all men deemed him dead.<br/><br/>But with no sound he raised aloft his hand,<br/>And thence what seemed a ray of light there flew<br/>And past the maid rolled on along the sand;<br/>Then trembling she her feet together drew<br/>And in her heart a strong desire there grew<br/>To have the toy, some god she thought had given<br/>That gift to her, to make of earth a heaven.<br/><br/>Then from the course with eager steps she ran,<br/>And in her odorous bosom laid the gold.<br/>But when she turned again, the great-limbed man,<br/>Now well ahead she failed not to behold,<br/>And mindful of her glory waxing cold,<br/>Sprang up and followed him in hot pursuit,<br/>Though with one hand she touched the golden fruit.<br/><br/>Note, too, the bow that she was wont to bear<br/>She laid aside to grasp the glittering prize,<br/>And o'er her shoulder from the quiver fair<br/>Three arrows fell and lay before her eyes<br/>Unnoticed, as amidst the people's cries<br/>She sprang to head the strong Milanion,<br/>Who now the turning-post had well-nigh won.<br/><br/>But as he set his mighty hand on it<br/>White fingers underneath his own were laid,<br/>And white limbs from his dazzled eyes did flit,<br/>Then he the second fruit cast by the maid:<br/>She ran awhile, and then as one afraid<br/>Wavered and stopped, and turned and made no stay,<br/>Until the globe with its bright fellow lay.<br/><br/>Then, as a troubled glance she cast around,<br/>Now far ahead the Argive could she see,<br/>And in her garment's hem one hand she wound<br/>To keep the double prize, and strenuously<br/>Sped o'er the course, and little doubt had she<br/>To win the day, though now but scanty space<br/>Was left betwixt him and the winning place.<br/><br/>Short was the way unto such wing√®d feet,<br/>Quickly she gained upon him till at last<br/>He turned about her eager eyes to meet<br/>And from his hand the third fair apple cast.<br/>She wavered not, but turned and ran so fast<br/>After the prize that should her bliss fulfil,<br/>That in her hand it lay ere it was still.<br/><br/>Nor did she rest, but turned about to win<br/>Once more, an unblest woeful victory--<br/>And yet--and yet--why does her breath begin<br/>To fail her, and her feet drag heavily?<br/>Why fails she now to see if far or nigh<br/>The goal is? why do her gray eyes grow dim?<br/>Why do these tremors run through every limb?<br/><br/>She spreads her arms abroad some stay to find<br/>Else must she fall, indeed, and findeth this,<br/>A strong man's arms about her body twined.<br/>Nor may she shudder now to feel his kiss,<br/>So wrapped she is in new unbroken bliss:<br/>Made happy that the foe the prize hath won,<br/>She weeps glad tears for all her glory done.<br/><br/>Shatter the trumpet, hew adown the posts!<br/>Upon the brazen altar break the sword,<br/>And scatter incense to appease the ghosts<br/>Of those who died here by their own award.<br/>Bring forth the image of the mighty Lord,<br/>And her who unseen o'er the runners hung,<br/>And did a deed for ever to be sung.<br/><br/>Here are the gathered folk; make no delay,<br/>Open King Sch≈ìneus' well-filled treasury,<br/>Bring out the gifts long hid from light of day,<br/>The golden bowls o'erwrought with imagery,<br/>Gold chains, and unguents brought from over sea,<br/>The saffron gown the old Ph≈ìnician brought,<br/>Within the temple of the Goddess wrought.<br/><br/>O ye, O damsels, who shall never see<br/>Her, that Love's servant bringeth now to you,<br/>Returning from another victory,<br/>In some cool bower do all that now is due!<br/>Since she in token of her service new<br/>Shall give to Venus offerings rich enow,<br/>Her maiden zone, her arrows and her bow.
