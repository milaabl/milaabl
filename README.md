# üíÆ An Hymn In Honour Of Beauty by *Edmund Spenser*

<p>
    AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?<br/>What wontless fury dost thou now inspire<br/>Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?<br/>Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,<br/>Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,<br/>And up aloft above my strength dost raise<br/>The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.<br/><br/>That as I erst in praise of thine own name,<br/>So now in honour of thy mother dear,<br/>An honourable hymn I eke should frame,<br/>And with the brightness of her beauty clear,<br/>The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear<br/>To admiration of that heavenly light,<br/>From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.<br/><br/>Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,<br/>Mother of love, and of all world's delight,<br/>Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty<br/>Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,<br/>Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light<br/>T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,<br/>And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:<br/><br/>That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,<br/>And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam<br/>Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,<br/>That now it wasted is with woes extreme,<br/>It may so please, that she at length will stream<br/>Some dew of grace into my withered heart,<br/>After long sorrow and consuming smart.<br/><br/>WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast<br/>To make all things such as we now behold,<br/>It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd<br/>A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould<br/>He fashion'd them as comely as he could;<br/>That now so fair and seemly they appear,<br/>As nought may be amended anywhere.<br/><br/>That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,<br/>Whether in earth laid up in secret store,<br/>Or else in heaven, that no man may it see<br/>With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,<br/>Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;<br/>Whose face and feature doth so much excel<br/>All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.<br/><br/>Thereof as every earthly thing partakes<br/>Or more or less, by influence divine,<br/>So it more fair accordingly it makes,<br/>And the gross matter of this earthly mine,<br/>Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,<br/>Doing away the dross which dims the light<br/>Of that fair beam which therein is empight.<br/><br/>For, through infusion of celestial power,<br/>The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,<br/>And lifeful spirits privily doth pour<br/>Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight<br/>They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,<br/>O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam<br/>Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.<br/><br/>That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace<br/>To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,<br/>Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,<br/>Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,<br/>And robs the hearts of those which it admire;<br/>Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,<br/>That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.<br/><br/>How vainly then do idle wits invent,<br/>That beauty is nought else but mixture made<br/>Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament<br/>Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade<br/>And pass away, like to a summer's shade;<br/>Or that it is but comely composition<br/>Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.<br/><br/>Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,<br/>That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,<br/>And therein stir such rage and restless stour,<br/>As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?<br/>Or can proportion of the outward part<br/>Move such affection in the inward mind,<br/>That it can rob both sense and reason blind?<br/><br/>Why do not then the blossoms of the field,<br/>Which are array'd with much more orient hue,<br/>And to the sense most dainty odours yield,<br/>Work like impression in the looker's view?<br/>Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,<br/>In which oft-times we nature see of art<br/>Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?<br/><br/>But ah, believe me, there is more than so,<br/>That works such wonders in the minds of men;<br/>I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,<br/>And whoso list the like assays to ken,<br/>Shall find by trial, and confess it then,<br/>That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,<br/>An outward shew of things, that only seem.<br/><br/>For that same goodly hue of white and red,<br/>With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,<br/>And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread<br/>Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away<br/>To that they were, even to corrupted clay;<br/>That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,<br/>Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.<br/><br/>But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray<br/>That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,<br/>Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;<br/>But when the vital spirits do expire,<br/>Unto her native planet shall retire;<br/>For it is heavenly born and cannot die,<br/>Being a parcel of the purest sky.<br/><br/>For when the soul, the which derived was,<br/>At first, out of that great immortal Spright,<br/>By whom all live to love, whilom did pass<br/>Down from the top of purest heaven's height<br/>To be embodied here, it then took light<br/>And lively spirits from that fairest star,<br/>Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.<br/><br/>Which power retaining still or more or less,<br/>When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,<br/>Through every part she doth the same impress,<br/>According as the heavens have her graced,<br/>And frames her house, in which she will be placed,<br/>Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil<br/>Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.<br/><br/>Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have<br/>The most resemblance of that heavenly light,<br/>Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave<br/>Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,<br/>And the gross matter by a sovereign might<br/>Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen<br/>A palace fit for such a virgin queen.<br/><br/>So every spirit, as it is most pure,<br/>And hath in it the more of heavenly light,<br/>So it the fairer body doth procure<br/>To habit in, and it more fairly dight<br/>With cheerful grace and amiable sight.<br/>For of the soul the body form doth take:<br/>For soul is form, and doth the body make.<br/><br/>Therefore wherever that thou dost behold<br/>A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,<br/>Know this for certain, that the same doth hold<br/>A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,<br/>Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.<br/>For all that fair is, is by nature good;<br/>That is a sign to know the gentle blood.<br/><br/>Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind<br/>Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,<br/>Either by chance, against the course of kind,<br/>Or through unaptness in the substance found,<br/>Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,<br/>That will not yield unto her form's direction,<br/>But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.<br/><br/>And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)<br/>That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,<br/>Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,<br/>Which doth the world with her delight adorn,<br/>Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,<br/>Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,<br/>But every one doth seek but to deprave it.<br/><br/>Yet nath√´more is that fair beauty's blame,<br/>But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:<br/>Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame<br/>May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:<br/>Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,<br/>However flesh{"e}s fault it filthy make;<br/>For things immortal no corruption take.<br/><br/>But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments<br/>And lively images of heaven's light,<br/>Let not your beams with such disparagements<br/>Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;<br/>But mindful still of your first country's sight,<br/>Do still preserve your first informed grace,<br/>Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.<br/><br/>Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,<br/>Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,<br/>That base affections, which your ears would bland,<br/>Commend to you by love's abused name,<br/>But is indeed the bondslave of defame;<br/>Which will the garland of your glory mar,<br/>And quench the light of your bright shining star.<br/><br/>But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,<br/>Will more illumine your resplendent ray,<br/>And add more brightness to your goodly hue,<br/>From light of his pure fire; which, by like way<br/>Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;<br/>Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,<br/>Do both express the face's first impression.<br/><br/>Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,<br/>It you behoves to love, and forth to lay<br/>That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,<br/>That men the more admire their fountain may;<br/>For else what booteth that celestial ray,<br/>If it in darkness be enshrined ever,<br/>That it of loving eyes be viewed never?<br/><br/>But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,<br/>That likest to yourselves ye them select,<br/>The which your forms' first source may sympathize,<br/>And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;<br/>For, if you loosely love without respect,<br/>It is no love, but a discordant war,<br/>Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.<br/><br/>For love is a celestial harmony<br/>Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,<br/>Which join together in sweet sympathy,<br/>To work each other's joy and true content,<br/>Which they have harbour'd since their first descent<br/>Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see<br/>And know each other here belov'd to be.<br/><br/>Then wrong it were that any other twain<br/>Should in love's gentle band combined be<br/>But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,<br/>And made out of one mould the more t' agree;<br/>For all that like the beauty which they see,<br/>Straight do not love; for love is not so light<br/>As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.<br/><br/>But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,<br/>With pure regard and spotless true intent,<br/>Drawing out of the object of their eyes<br/>A more refined form, which they present<br/>Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;<br/>Which it reducing to her first perfection,<br/>Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.<br/><br/>And then conforming it unto the light,<br/>Which in itself it hath remaining still,<br/>Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,<br/>Thereof he fashions in his higher skill<br/>An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;<br/>And it embracing in his mind entire,<br/>The mirror of his own thought doth admire.<br/><br/>Which seeing now so inly fair to be,<br/>As outward it appeareth to the eye,<br/>And with his spirit's proportion to agree,<br/>He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,<br/>And fully setteth his felicity;<br/>Counting it fairer than it is indeed,<br/>And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.<br/><br/>For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be<br/>Than other men's, and in dear love's delight<br/>See more than any other eyes can see,<br/>Through mutual receipt of beam{"e}s bright,<br/>Which carry privy message to the spright,<br/>And to their eyes that inmost fair display,<br/>As plain as light discovers dawning day.<br/><br/>Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,<br/>Armies of loves still flying to and fro,<br/>Which dart at them their little fiery lances;<br/>Whom having wounded, back again they go,<br/>Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;<br/>Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,<br/>Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.<br/><br/>In which how many wonders do they rede<br/>To their conceit, that others never see,<br/>Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,<br/>Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;<br/>Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;<br/>But when her words' emb√°ssade forth she sends,<br/>Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.<br/><br/>Sometimes upon her forehead they behold<br/>A thousand graces masking in delight;<br/>Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold<br/>Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight<br/>Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;<br/>But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,<br/>So many millions of chaste pleasures play.<br/><br/>All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more<br/>Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,<br/>To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,<br/>That may it more to mortal eyes commend,<br/>And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:<br/>That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,<br/>And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.<br/><br/>Then I√∂, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,<br/>Advance the banner of thy conquest high,<br/>That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,<br/>May draw to thee, and with due fealty<br/>Adore the power of thy great majesty,<br/>Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,<br/>Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.<br/><br/>In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,<br/>That she whose conquering beauty doth captive<br/>My trembling heart in her eternal chain,<br/>One drop of grace at length will to me give,<br/>That I her bounden thrall by her may live,<br/>And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,<br/>May owe to her, of whom I it received.<br/><br/>And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,<br/>Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,<br/>When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,<br/>Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,<br/>That may recure my heart's long pining grief,<br/>And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,<br/>That can restore a damned wight from death.
