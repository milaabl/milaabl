<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Italian Music in Dakota. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    THROUGH the soft evening air enwrinding all,<br/>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds,<br/>In dulcet streams, in flutes‚Äô and cornets‚Äô notes,<br/>Electric, pensive, turbulent artificial,<br/>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before,<br/>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here,<br/>Not to the city‚Äôs fresco‚Äôd rooms, not to the audience of the opera house,<br/>Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home,<br/>Sonnambula‚Äôs innocent love, trios with Norma‚Äôs anguish,<br/>And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)<br/>Ray‚Äôd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br/>Music, Italian music in Dakota.<br/><br/>While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl‚Äôd realm,<br/>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br/>Acknowledging rapport however far remov‚Äôd,<br/>(As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower or fruit,)<br/>Listens well pleas‚Äôd.
</p>
