  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Walt Whitman. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    1<br/>I CELEBRATE myself;<br/>And what I assume you shall assume;<br/>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.<br/><br/>I loafe and invite my Soul;<br/>I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.<br/><br/>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes‚Äîthe shelves are crowded with<br/>  perfumes;<br/>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it;<br/>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is not a perfume‚Äîit has no taste of the distillation‚Äîit<br/>  is odorless;<br/>It is for my mouth forever‚ÄîI am in love with it;<br/>I will go to the bank by the wood, and become undisguised and naked;<br/>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.<br/><br/>2<br/>The smoke of my own breath;<br/>Echoes, ripples, buzz‚Äôd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine;<br/>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood<br/>  and air through my lungs;<br/>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore, and<br/>  dark-color‚Äôd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn;<br/>The sound of the belch‚Äôd words of my voice, words loos‚Äôd to the eddies<br/>  of the wind;<br/>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms;<br/>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag;<br/>The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and<br/>  hill-sides;<br/>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and<br/>  meeting the sun.<br/><br/>Have you reckon‚Äôd a thousand acres much? have you reckon‚Äôd the earth<br/>  much?<br/>Have you practis‚Äôd so long to learn to read?<br/>Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?<br/><br/>Stop this day and night with me, and you shall possess the origin of all poems;<br/>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun‚Äî(there are millions of suns<br/>  left;)<br/>You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the<br/>  eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books;<br/>You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me:<br/>You shall listen to all sides, and filter them from yourself.<br/><br/>3<br/>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the<br/>  end;<br/>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br/><br/>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br/>Nor any more youth or age than there is now;<br/>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br/>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.<br/><br/>Urge, and urge, and urge;<br/>Always the procreant urge of the world.<br/><br/>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance‚Äîalways substance and increase,<br/>  always sex;<br/>Always a knit of identity‚Äîalways distinction‚Äîalways a breed of life.<br/><br/>To elaborate is no avail‚Äîlearn‚Äôd and unlearn‚Äôd feel that it is<br/>  so.<br/><br/>Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in<br/>  the beams,<br/>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,<br/>I and this mystery, here we stand.<br/><br/>Clear and sweet is my Soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my Soul.<br/><br/>Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,<br/>Till that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its turn.<br/><br/>Showing the best, and dividing it from the worst, age vexes age;<br/>Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am<br/>  silent, and go bathe and admire myself.<br/><br/>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean;<br/>Not an inch, nor a particle of an inch, is vile, and none shall be less familiar<br/>  than the rest.<br/><br/>I am satisfied‚ÄîI see, dance, laugh, sing:<br/>As the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and<br/>  withdraws at the peep of the day, with stealthy tread,<br/>Leaving me baskets cover‚Äôd with white towels, swelling the house with their<br/>  plenty,<br/>Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, and scream at my eyes,<br/>That they turn from gazing after and down the road,<br/>And forthwith cipher and show me a cent,<br/>Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and which is<br/>  ahead?<br/><br/>4<br/>Trippers and askers surround me;<br/>People I meet‚Äîthe effect upon me of my early life, or the ward and city I<br/>  live in, or the nation,<br/>The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,<br/>My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,<br/>The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,<br/>The sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or ill-doing, or loss or lack of<br/>  money, or depressions or exaltations;<br/>Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful<br/>  events;<br/>These come to me days and nights, and go from me again,<br/>But they are not the Me myself.<br/><br/>Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am;<br/>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary;<br/>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,<br/>Looking with side-curved head, curious what will come next;<br/>Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering at it.<br/><br/>Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and<br/>  contenders;<br/>I have no mockings or arguments‚ÄîI witness and wait.<br/><br/>5<br/>I believe in you, my Soul‚Äîthe other I am must not abase itself to you;<br/>And you must not be abased to the other.<br/><br/>Loafe with me on the grass‚Äîloose the stop from your throat;<br/>Not words, not music or rhyme I want‚Äînot custom or lecture, not even the<br/>  best;<br/>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.<br/><br/>I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning;<br/>How you settled your head athwart my hips, and gently turn‚Äôd over upon me,<br/>And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my<br/>  bare-stript heart,<br/>And reach‚Äôd till you felt my beard, and reach‚Äôd till you held my feet.<br/><br/><br/>Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the<br/>  argument of the earth;<br/>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,<br/>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own;<br/>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters<br/>  and lovers;<br/>And that a kelson of the creation is love;<br/>And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields;<br/>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them;<br/>And mossy scabs of the worm fence, and heap‚Äôd stones, elder, mullen and<br/>  poke-weed.<br/><br/>6<br/>A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br/>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is, any more than he.<br/><br/>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.<br/><br/><br/>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br/>A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropt,<br/>Bearing the owner‚Äôs name someway in the corners, that we may see and<br/>  remark, and say, Whose?<br/><br/>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.<br/><br/>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic;<br/>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br/>Growing among black folks as among white;<br/>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the<br/>  same.<br/><br/>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.<br/><br/>Tenderly will I use you, curling grass;<br/>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;<br/>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;<br/>It may be you are from old people, and from women, and from offspring taken soon<br/>  out of their mothers‚Äô laps;<br/>And here you are the mothers‚Äô laps.<br/><br/>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers;<br/>Darker than the colorless beards of old men;<br/>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.<br/><br/>O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!<br/>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.<br/><br/>I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,<br/>And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of<br/>  their laps.<br/><br/>What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br/>And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br/><br/>They are alive and well somewhere;<br/>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death;<br/>And if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to<br/>  arrest it,<br/>And ceas‚Äôd the moment life appear‚Äôd.<br/><br/>All goes onward and outward‚Äînothing collapses;<br/>And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.<br/><br/>7<br/>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?<br/>I hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.<br/><br/>I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-wash‚Äôd babe, and am not<br/>  contain‚Äôd between my hat and boots;<br/>And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good;<br/>The earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.<br/><br/>I am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;<br/>I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as<br/>  myself;<br/>(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)<br/><br/>Every kind for itself and its own‚Äîfor me mine, male and female;<br/>For me those that have been boys, and that love women;<br/>For me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings to be slighted;<br/>For me the sweet-heart and the old maid‚Äîfor me mothers, and the mothers of<br/>  mothers;<br/>For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears;<br/>For me children, and the begetters of children.<br/><br/>Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded;<br/>I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no;<br/>And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.<br/><br/>8<br/>The little one sleeps in its cradle;<br/>I lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my<br/>  hand.<br/><br/>The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill;<br/>I peeringly view them from the top.<br/><br/>The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-room;<br/>I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair‚ÄîI note where the pistol has<br/>  fallen.<br/><br/>The blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the<br/>  promenaders;<br/>The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the<br/>  shod horses on the granite floor;<br/>The snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs;<br/>The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous‚Äôd mobs;<br/>The flap of the curtain‚Äôd litter, a sick man inside, borne to the hospital;<br/>The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall;<br/>The excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to<br/>  the centre of the crowd;<br/>The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes;<br/>What groans of over-fed or half-starv‚Äôd who fall sun-struck, or in fits;<br/>What exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to<br/>  babes;<br/>What living and buried speech is always vibrating here‚Äîwhat howls<br/>  restrain‚Äôd by decorum;<br/>Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections<br/>  with convex lips;<br/>I mind them or the show or resonance of them‚ÄîI come, and I depart.<br/><br/>9<br/>The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready;<br/>The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon;<br/>The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged;<br/>The armfuls are pack‚Äôd to the sagging mow.<br/><br/>I am there‚ÄîI help‚ÄîI came stretch‚Äôd atop of the load;<br/>I felt its soft jolts‚Äîone leg reclined on the other;<br/>I jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and timothy,<br/>And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps.<br/><br/>10<br/>Alone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,<br/>Wandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee;<br/>In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,<br/>Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill‚Äôd game;<br/>Falling asleep on the gather‚Äôd leaves, with my dog and gun by my side.<br/><br/>The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails‚Äîshe cuts the sparkle and scud;<br/>My eyes settle the land‚ÄîI bend at her prow, or shout joyously from the<br/>  deck.<br/><br/>The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me;<br/>I tuck‚Äôd my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and had a good time:<br/>(You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.)<br/><br/>I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west‚Äîthe bride<br/>  was a red girl;<br/>Her father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly smoking‚Äîthey<br/>  had moccasins to their feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their<br/>  shoulders;<br/>On a bank lounged the trapper‚Äîhe was drest mostly in skins‚Äîhis<br/>  luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck‚Äîhe held his bride by the hand;<br/><br/>She had long eyelashes‚Äîher head was bare‚Äîher coarse straight locks<br/>  descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach‚Äôd to her feet.<br/><br/>The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside;<br/>I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile;<br/>Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,<br/>And went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him,<br/>And brought water, and fill‚Äôd a tub for his sweated body and bruis‚Äôd<br/>  feet,<br/>And gave him a room that enter‚Äôd from my own, and gave him some coarse<br/>  clean clothes,<br/>And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,<br/>And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;<br/>He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass‚Äôd north;<br/>(I had him sit next me at table‚Äîmy fire-lock lean‚Äôd in the corner.)<br/><br/>11<br/>Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;<br/>Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:<br/>Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.<br/><br/>She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;<br/>She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window.<br/><br/>Which of the young men does she like the best?<br/>Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.<br/><br/>Where are you off to, lady? for I see you;<br/>You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.<br/><br/>Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;<br/>The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.<br/><br/>The beards of the young men glisten‚Äôd with wet, it ran from their long<br/>  hair:<br/>Little streams pass‚Äôd all over their bodies.<br/><br/>An unseen hand also pass‚Äôd over their bodies;<br/>It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.<br/><br/>The young men float on their backs‚Äîtheir white bellies bulge to the<br/>  sun‚Äîthey do not ask who seizes fast to them;<br/>They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch;<br/>They do not think whom they souse with spray.<br/><br/>12<br/>The butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall<br/>  in the market;<br/>I loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and break-down.<br/><br/>Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil;<br/>Each has his main-sledge‚Äîthey are all out‚Äî(there is a great heat in<br/>  the fire.)<br/><br/>From the cinder-strew‚Äôd threshold I follow their movements;<br/>The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms;<br/>Over-hand the hammers swing‚Äîover-hand so slow‚Äîover-hand so sure:<br/>They do not hasten‚Äîeach man hits in his place.<br/><br/>13<br/>The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses‚Äîthe block swags<br/>  underneath on its tied-over chain;<br/>The negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard‚Äîsteady and tall he stands,<br/>  pois‚Äôd on one leg on the string-piece;<br/>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and loosens over his hip-band;<br/><br/>His glance is calm and commanding‚Äîhe tosses the slouch of his hat away from<br/>  his forehead;<br/>The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache‚Äîfalls on the black of his<br/>  polish‚Äôd and perfect limbs.<br/><br/>I behold the picturesque giant, and love him‚Äîand I do not stop there;<br/>I go with the team also.<br/><br/>In me the caresser of life wherever moving‚Äîbackward as well as forward<br/>  slueing;<br/>To niches aside and junior bending.<br/><br/>Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! what is that<br/>  you express in your eyes?<br/>It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.<br/><br/>My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on my distant and day-long ramble;<br/><br/>They rise together‚Äîthey slowly circle around.<br/><br/>I believe in those wing‚Äôd purposes,<br/>And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,<br/>And consider green and violet, and the tufted crown, intentional;<br/>And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else;<br/>And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me;<br/>And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.<br/><br/>14<br/>The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night;<br/>Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;<br/>(The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close;<br/>I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.)<br/><br/>The sharp-hoof‚Äôd moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the<br/>  chickadee, the prairie-dog,<br/>The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,<br/>The brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-spread wings;<br/>I see in them and myself the same old law.<br/><br/>The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections;<br/>They scorn the best I can do to relate them.<br/><br/>I am enamour‚Äôd of growing out-doors,<br/>Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods,<br/>Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes and mauls, and<br/>  the drivers of horses;<br/>I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.<br/><br/>What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me;<br/>Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns;<br/>Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me;<br/>Not asking the sky to come down to my good will;<br/>Scattering it freely forever.<br/><br/>15<br/>The pure contralto sings in the organ loft;<br/>The carpenter dresses his plank‚Äîthe tongue of his foreplane whistles its<br/>  wild ascending lisp;<br/>The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner;<br/>The pilot seizes the king-pin‚Äîhe heaves down with a strong arm;<br/>The mate stands braced in the whale-boat‚Äîlance and harpoon are ready;<br/>The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches;<br/>The deacons are ordain‚Äôd with cross‚Äôd hands at the altar;<br/>The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel;<br/>The farmer stops by the bars, as he walks on a First-day loafe, and looks at the<br/>  oats and rye;<br/>The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum, a confirm‚Äôd case,<br/>(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother‚Äôs<br/>  bed-room;)<br/>The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,<br/>He turns his quid of tobacco, while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;<br/>The malform‚Äôd limbs are tied to the surgeon‚Äôs table,<br/>What is removed drops horribly in a pail;<br/>The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand‚Äîthe drunkard nods by the<br/>  bar-room stove;<br/>The machinist rolls up his sleeves‚Äîthe policeman travels his beat‚Äîthe<br/>  gate-keeper marks who pass;<br/>The young fellow drives the express-wagon‚Äî(I love him, though I do not know<br/>  him;)<br/>The half-breed straps on his light boots to complete in the race;<br/>The western turkey-shooting draws old and young‚Äîsome lean on their rifles,<br/>  some sit on logs,<br/>Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;<br/>The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee;<br/>As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his<br/>  saddle;<br/>The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the<br/>  dancers bow to each other;<br/>The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof‚Äôd garret, and harks to the musical<br/>  rain;<br/>The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron;<br/>The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm‚Äôd cloth, is offering moccasins and<br/>  bead-bags for sale;<br/>The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent<br/>  sideways;<br/>As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat, the plank is thrown for the<br/>  shore-going passengers;<br/>The young sister holds out the skein, while the elder sister winds it off in a<br/>  ball, and stops now and then for the knots;<br/>The one-year wife is recovering and happy, having a week ago borne her first<br/>  child;<br/>The clean-hair‚Äôd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine, or in the<br/>  factory or mill;<br/>The nine months‚Äô gone is in the parturition chamber, her faintness and<br/>  pains are advancing;<br/>The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer‚Äîthe reporter‚Äôs lead<br/>  flies swiftly over the note-book‚Äîthe sign-painter is lettering with red and<br/>  gold;<br/>The canal boy trots on the tow-path‚Äîthe book-keeper counts at his<br/>  desk‚Äîthe shoemaker waxes his thread;<br/>The conductor beats time for the band, and all the performers follow him;<br/>The child is baptized‚Äîthe convert is making his first professions;<br/>The regatta is spread on the bay‚Äîthe race is begun‚Äîhow the white sails<br/>  sparkle!<br/>The drover, watching his drove, sings out to them that would stray;<br/>The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the<br/>  odd cent;)<br/>The camera and plate are prepared, the lady must sit for her daguerreotype;<br/>The bride unrumples her white dress,

field;<br/>Over the sharp-peak‚Äôd farm house, with its scallop‚Äôd scum and slender<br/>  shoots from the gutters;<br/>Over the western persimmon‚Äîover the long-leav‚Äôd corn‚Äîover the<br/>  delicate blue-flower flax;<br/>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest;<br/>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;<br/>Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged<br/>  limbs;<br/>Walking the path worn in the grass, and beat through the leaves of the brush;<br/>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot;<br/>Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve‚Äîwhere the great gold-bug drops<br/>  through the dark;<br/>Where flails keep time on the barn floor;<br/>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow;<br/>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their<br/>  hides;<br/>Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen‚Äîwhere andirons straddle the<br/>  hearth-slab‚Äîwhere cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;<br/>Where trip-hammers crash‚Äîwhere the press is whirling its cylinders;<br/>Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs;<br/>Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself, and<br/>  looking composedly down;)<br/>Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose‚Äîwhere the heat hatches<br/>  pale-green eggs in the dented sand;<br/>Where the she-whale swims with her calf, and never forsakes it;<br/>Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke;<br/>Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water;<br/>Where the half-burn‚Äôd brig is riding on unknown currents,<br/>Where shells grow to her slimy deck‚Äîwhere the dead are corrupting below;<br/>Where the dense-starr‚Äôd flag is borne at the head of the regiments;<br/>Approaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching island;<br/>Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance;<br/>Upon a door-step‚Äîupon the horse-block of hard wood outside;<br/>Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a good game of base-ball;<br/>At he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking,<br/>  laughter;<br/>At the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice<br/>  through a straw;<br/>At apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find;<br/>At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings:<br/>Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps;<br/>Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard‚Äîwhere the dry-stalks are<br/>  scattered‚Äîwhere the brood-cow waits in the hovel;<br/>Where the bull advances to do his masculine work‚Äîwhere the stud to the<br/>  mare‚Äîwhere the cock is treading the hen;<br/>Where the heifers browse‚Äîwhere geese nip their food with short jerks;<br/>Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie;<br/>Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near;<br/>Where the humming-bird shimmers‚Äîwhere the neck of the long-lived swan is<br/>  curving and winding;<br/>Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human<br/>  laugh;<br/>Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden, half hid by the high weeds;<br/><br/>Where band-neck‚Äôd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads<br/>  out;<br/>Where burial coaches enter the arch‚Äôd gates of a cemetery;<br/>Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees;<br/>Where the yellow-crown‚Äôd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and<br/>  feeds upon small crabs;<br/>Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon;<br/>Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well;<br/>Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves;<br/>Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs;<br/>Through the gymnasium‚Äîthrough the curtain‚Äôd saloon‚Äîthrough the<br/>  office or public hall;<br/>Pleas‚Äôd with the native, and pleas‚Äôd with the<br/>  foreign‚Äîpleas‚Äôd with the new and old;<br/>Pleas‚Äôd with women, the homely as well as the handsome;<br/>Pleas‚Äôd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks<br/>  melodiously;<br/>Pleas‚Äôd with the tune of the choir of the white-wash‚Äôd church;<br/>Pleas‚Äôd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, or any<br/>  preacher‚Äîimpress‚Äôd seriously at the camp-meeting:<br/>Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon‚Äîflatting the<br/>  flesh of my nose on the thick plate-glass;<br/>Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn‚Äôd up to the clouds,<br/>My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle:<br/>Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek‚Äôd bush-boy‚Äî(behind me he<br/>  rides at the drape of the day;)<br/>Far from the settlements, studying the print of animals‚Äô feet, or the<br/>  moccasin print;<br/>By the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade to a feverish patient;<br/>Nigh the coffin‚Äôd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle:<br/>Voyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure;<br/>Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any;<br/>Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him;<br/>Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while;<br/>Walking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful gentle God by my side;<br/>Speeding through space‚Äîspeeding through heaven and the stars;<br/>Speeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad ring, and the diameter of<br/>  eighty thousand miles;<br/>Speeding with tail‚Äôd meteors‚Äîthrowing fire-balls like the rest;<br/>Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly;<br/>Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,<br/>Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing;<br/>I tread day and night such roads.<br/><br/>I visit the orchards of spheres, and look at the product:<br/>And look at quintillions ripen‚Äôd, and look at quintillions green.<br/><br/>I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul;<br/>My course runs below the soundings of plummets.<br/><br/>I help myself to material and immaterial;<br/>No guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me.<br/><br/>I anchor my ship for a little while only;<br/>My messengers continually cruise away, or bring their returns to me.<br/><br/>I go hunting polar furs and the seal‚Äîleaping chasms with a pike-pointed<br/>  staff‚Äîclinging to topples of brittle and blue.<br/><br/>I ascend to the foretruck;<br/>I take my place late at night in the crow‚Äôs-nest;<br/>We sail the arctic sea‚Äîit is plenty light enough;<br/>Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty;<br/>The enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them‚Äîthe scenery is plain in<br/>  all directions;<br/>The white-topt mountains show in the distance‚ÄîI fling out my fancies toward<br/>  them;<br/>(We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged;<br/>We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment‚Äîwe pass with still feet and<br/>  caution;<br/>Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin‚Äôd city;<br/>The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the<br/>  globe.)<br/><br/>I am a free companion‚ÄîI bivouac by invading watchfires.<br/><br/>I turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the bride myself;<br/>I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.<br/><br/>My voice is the wife‚Äôs voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs;<br/>They fetch my man‚Äôs body up, dripping and drown‚Äôd.<br/><br/>I understand the large hearts of heroes,<br/>The courage of present times and all times;<br/>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and<br/>  Death chasing it up and down the storm;<br/>How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and<br/>  faithful of nights,<br/>And chalk‚Äôd in large letters, on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not<br/>  desert you:<br/>How he follow‚Äôd with them, and tack‚Äôd with them‚Äîand would not<br/>  give it up;<br/>How he saved the drifting company at last:<br/>How the lank loose-gown‚Äôd women look‚Äôd when boated from the side of<br/>  their prepared graves;<br/>How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp‚Äôd<br/>  unshaved men:<br/>All this I swallow‚Äîit tastes good‚ÄîI like it well‚Äîit becomes mine;<br/>I am the man‚ÄîI suffer‚Äôd‚ÄîI was there.<br/><br/>The disdain and calmness of olden martyrs;<br/>The mother, condemn‚Äôd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing<br/>  on;<br/>The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing,<br/>  cover‚Äôd with sweat;<br/>The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck‚Äîthe murderous<br/>  buckshot and the bullets;<br/>All these I feel, or am.<br/><br/>I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,<br/>Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen;<br/>I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn‚Äôd with the ooze of my<br/>  skin;<br/>I fall on the weeds and stones;<br/>The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,<br/>Taunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.<br/><br/>Agonies are one of my changes of garments;<br/>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels‚ÄîI myself become the wounded<br/>  person;<br/>My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.<br/><br/>I am the mash‚Äôd fireman with breast-bone broken;<br/>Tumbling walls buried me in their debris;<br/>Heat and smoke I inspired‚ÄîI heard the yelling shouts of my comrades;<br/>I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;<br/>They have clear‚Äôd the beams away‚Äîthey tenderly lift me forth.<br/><br/>I lie in the night air in my red shirt‚Äîthe pervading hush is for my sake;<br/>Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy;<br/>White and beautiful are the faces around me‚Äîthe heads are bared of their<br/>  fire-caps;<br/>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.<br/><br/>Distant and dead resuscitate;<br/>They show as the dial or move as the hands of me‚ÄîI am the clock myself.<br/><br/>I am an old artillerist‚ÄîI tell of my fort‚Äôs bombardment;<br/>I am there again.<br/><br/>Again the long roll of the drummers;<br/>Again the attacking cannon, mortars;<br/>Again, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive.<br/><br/>I take part‚ÄîI see and hear the whole;<br/>The cries, curses, roar‚Äîthe plaudits for well-aim‚Äôd shots;<br/>The ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip;<br/>Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs;<br/>The fall of grenades through the rent roof‚Äîthe fan-shaped explosion;<br/>The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.<br/><br/>Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general‚Äîhe furiously waves with his<br/>  hand;<br/>He gasps through the clot, Mind not me‚Äîmind‚Äîthe entrenchments.<br/><br/>34<br/>Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth;<br/>(I tell not the fall of Alamo,<br/>Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,<br/>The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo;)<br/>‚ÄôTis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young<br/>  men.<br/><br/>Retreating, they had form‚Äôd in a hollow square, with their baggage for<br/>  breastworks;<br/>Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy‚Äôs, nine times their number,<br/>  was the price they took in advance;<br/>Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone;<br/>They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv‚Äôd writing and seal, gave<br/>  up their arms, and march‚Äôd back prisoners of war.<br/><br/>They were the glory of the race of rangers;<br/>Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,<br/>Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,<br/>Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,<br/>Not a single one over thirty years of age.<br/><br/>The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads, and<br/>  massacred‚Äîit was beautiful early summer;<br/>The work commenced about five o‚Äôclock, and was over by eight.<br/><br/>None obey‚Äôd the command to kneel;<br/>Some made a mad and helpless rush‚Äîsome stood stark and straight;<br/>A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart‚Äîthe living and dead lay<br/>  together;<br/>The maim‚Äôd and mangled dug in the dirt‚Äîthe newcomers saw them there;<br/>Some, half-kill‚Äôd, attempted to crawl away;<br/>These were despatch‚Äôd with bayonets, or batter‚Äôd with the blunts of<br/>  muskets;<br/>A youth not seventeen years old seiz‚Äôd his assassin till two more came to<br/>  release him;<br/>The three were all torn, and cover‚Äôd with the boy‚Äôs blood.<br/><br/>At eleven o‚Äôclock began the burning of the bodies:<br/>That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.<br/><br/>35<br/>Would you hear of an old-fashion‚Äôd sea-fight?<br/>Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?<br/>List to the story as my grandmother‚Äôs father, the sailor, told it to me.<br/><br/>Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, (said he;)<br/>His was the surly English pluck‚Äîand there is no tougher or truer, and never<br/>  was, and never will be;<br/>Along the lower‚Äôd eve he came, horribly raking us.<br/><br/>We closed with him‚Äîthe yards entangled‚Äîthe cannon touch‚Äôd;<br/>My captain lash‚Äôd fast with his own hands.<br/><br/>We had receiv‚Äôd some eighteen pound shots under the water;<br/>On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all<br/>  around, and blowing up overhead.<br/><br/>Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark;<br/>Ten o‚Äôclock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and<br/>  five feet of water reported;<br/>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold, to give them<br/>  a chance for themselves.<br/><br/>The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,<br/>They see so many strange faces, they do not know whom to trust.<br/><br/>Our frigate takes fire;<br/>The other asks if we demand quarter?<br/>If our colors are struck, and the fighting is done?<br/><br/>Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,<br/>We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part<br/>  of the fighting.<br/><br/>Only three guns are in use;<br/>One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy‚Äôs mainmast;<br/>Two, well served with grape and canister, silence his musketry and clear his<br/>  decks.<br/><br/>The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top;<br/>They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.<br/><br/>Not a moment‚Äôs cease;<br/>The leaks gain fast on the pumps‚Äîthe fire eats toward the powder-magazine.<br/><br/>One of the pumps has been shot away‚Äîit is generally thought we are sinking.<br/><br/><br/>Serene stands the little captain;<br/>He is not hurried‚Äîhis voice is neither high nor low;<br/>His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.<br/><br/>Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they surrender to us.<br/><br/>36<br/>Stretch‚Äôd and still lies the midnight;<br/>Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness;<br/>Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking‚Äîpreparations to pass to the one we<br/>  have conquer‚Äôd;<br/>The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance<br/>  white as a sheet;<br/>Near by, the corpse of the child that serv‚Äôd in the cabin;<br/>The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl‚Äôd<br/>  whiskers;<br/>The flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering aloft and below;<br/>The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty;<br/>Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves‚Äîdabs of flesh upon the<br/>  masts and spars,<br/>Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,<br/>Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,<br/>Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore,<br/>  death-messages given in charge to survivors,<br/>The hiss of the surgeon‚Äôs knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,<br/>Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull,<br/>  tapering groan;<br/>These so‚Äîthese irretrievable.<br/><br/>37<br/>O Christ! This is mastering me!<br/>In at the conquer‚Äôd doors they crowd. I am possess‚Äôd.<br/><br/>I embody all presences outlaw‚Äôd or suffering;<br/>See myself in prison shaped like another man,<br/>And feel the dull unintermitted pain.<br/><br/>For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch;<br/>It is I let out
