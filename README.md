# üíÆ The Cenci.  a Tragedy in Five Acts by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    ACT 1.<br/><br/>SCENE 1.1:<br/>AN APARTMENT IN THE CENCI PALACE.<br/>ENTER COUNT CENCI AND CARDINAL CAMILLO.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>That matter of the murder is hushed up<br/>If you consent to yield his Holiness<br/>Your fief that lies beyond the Pincian gate.--<br/>It needed all my interest in the conclave<br/>To bend him to this point; he said that you<br/>Bought perilous impunity with your gold;<br/>That crimes like yours if once or twice compounded<br/>Enriched the Church, and respited from hell<br/>An erring soul which might repent and live: --<br/>But that the glory and the interest<br/>Of the high throne he fills, little consist<br/>With making it a daily mart of guilt<br/>As manifold and hideous as the deeds<br/>Which you scarce hide from men's revolted eyes.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>The third of my possessions--let it go!<br/>Ay, I once heard the nephew of the Pope<br/>Had sent his architect to view the ground,<br/>Meaning to build a villa on my vines<br/>The next time I compounded with his uncle:<br/>I little thought he should outwit me so!<br/>Henceforth no witness--not the lamp--shall see<br/>That which the vassal threatened to divulge<br/>Whose throat is choked with dust for his reward.<br/>The deed he saw could not have rated higher<br/>Than his most worthless life:--it angers me!<br/>Respited me from Hell! So may the Devil<br/>Respite their souls from Heaven! No doubt Pope Clement,<br/>And his most charitable nephews, pray<br/>That the Apostle Peter and the Saints<br/>Will grant for their sake that I long enjoy<br/>Strength, wealth, and pride, and lust, and length of days<br/>Wherein to act the deeds which are the stewards<br/>Of their revenue.--But much yet remains<br/>To which they show no title.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Oh, Count Cenci!<br/>So much that thou mightst honourably live<br/>And reconcile thyself with thine own heart<br/>And with thy God, and with the offended world.<br/>How hideously look deeds of lust and blood<br/>Through those snow white and venerable hairs!--<br/>Your children should be sitting round you now,<br/>But that you fear to read upon their looks<br/>The shame and misery you have written there.<br/>Where is your wife? Where is your gentle daughter?<br/>Methinks her sweet looks, which make all things else<br/>Beauteous and glad, might kill the fiend within you.<br/>Why is she barred from all society<br/>But her own strange and uncomplaining wrongs?<br/>Talk with me, Count,--you know I mean you well.<br/>I stood beside your dark and fiery youth<br/>Watching its bold and bad career, as men<br/>Watch meteors, but it vanished not--I marked<br/>Your desperate and remorseless manhood; now<br/>Do I behold you in dishonoured age<br/>Charged with a thousand unrepented crimes.<br/>Yet I have ever hoped you would amend,<br/>And in that hope have saved your life three times.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>For which Aldobrandino owes you now<br/>My fief beyond the Pincian.--Cardinal,<br/>One thing, I pray you, recollect henceforth,<br/>And so we shall converse with less restraint.<br/>A man you knew spoke of my wife and daughter--<br/>He was accustomed to frequent my house;<br/>So the next day HIS wife and daughter came<br/>And asked if I had seen him; and I smiled:<br/>I think they never saw him any more.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Thou execrable man, beware!--<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Of thee?<br/>Nay, this is idle: --We should know each other.<br/>As to my character for what men call crime<br/>Seeing I please my senses as I list,<br/>And vindicate that right with force or guile,<br/>It is a public matter, and I care not<br/>If I discuss it with you. I may speak<br/>Alike to you and my own conscious heart--<br/>For you give out that you have half reformed me,<br/>Therefore strong vanity will keep you silent<br/>If fear should not; both will, I do not doubt.<br/>All men delight in sensual luxury,<br/>All men enjoy revenge; and most exult<br/>Over the tortures they can never feel--<br/>Flattering their secret peace with others' pain.<br/>But I delight in nothing else. I love<br/>The sight of agony, and the sense of joy,<br/>When this shall be another's, and that mine.<br/>And I have no remorse and little fear,<br/>Which are, I think, the checks of other men.<br/>This mood has grown upon me, until now<br/>Any design my captious fancy makes<br/>The picture of its wish, and it forms none<br/>But such as men like you would start to know,<br/>Is as my natural food and rest debarred<br/>Until it be accomplished.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Art thou not<br/>Most miserable?<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Why miserable?--<br/>No.--I am what your theologians call<br/>Hardened;--which they must be in impudence,<br/>So to revile a man's peculiar taste.<br/>True, I was happier than I am, while yet<br/>Manhood remained to act the thing I thought;<br/>While lust was sweeter than revenge; and now<br/>Invention palls:--Ay, we must all grow old--<br/>And but that there remains a deed to act<br/>Whose horror might make sharp an appetite<br/>Duller than mine--I'd do,--I know not what.<br/>When I was young I thought of nothing else<br/>But pleasure; and I fed on honey sweets:<br/>Men, by St. Thomas! cannot live like bees,<br/>And I grew tired:--yet, till I killed a foe,<br/>And heard his groans, and heard his children's groans,<br/>Knew I not what delight was else on earth,<br/>Which now delights me little. I the rather<br/>Look on such pangs as terror ill conceals,<br/>The dry fixed eyeball; the pale, quivering lip,<br/>Which tell me that the spirit weeps within<br/>Tears bitterer than the bloody sweat of Christ.<br/>I rarely kill the body, which preserves,<br/>Like a strong prison, the soul within my power,<br/>Wherein I feed it with the breath of fear<br/>For hourly pain.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Hell's most abandoned fiend<br/>Did never, in the drunkenness of guilt,<br/>Speak to his heart as now you speak to me;<br/>I thank my God that I believe you not.<br/><br/>[ENTER ANDREA.]<br/><br/>ANDREA:<br/>My Lord, a gentleman from Salamanca<br/>Would speak with you.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Bid him attend me<br/>In the grand saloon.<br/><br/>[EXIT ANDREA.]<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Farewell; and I will pray<br/>Almighty God that thy false, impious words<br/>Tempt not his spirit to abandon thee.<br/><br/>[EXIT CAMILLO.]<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>The third of my possessions! I must use<br/>Close husbandry, or gold, the old man's sword,<br/>Falls from my withered hand. But yesterday<br/>There came an order from the Pope to make<br/>Fourfold provision for my cursed sons;<br/>Whom I had sent from Rome to Salamanca,<br/>Hoping some accident might cut them off;<br/>And meaning if I could to starve them there.<br/>I pray thee, God, send some quick death upon them!<br/>Bernardo and my wife could not be worse<br/>If dead and damned:--then, as to Beatrice--<br/>[LOOKING AROUND HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.]<br/>I think they cannot hear me at that door;<br/>What if they should? And yet I need not speak<br/>Though the heart triumphs with itself in words.<br/>O, thou most silent air, that shalt not hear<br/>What now I think! Thou, pavement, which I tread<br/>Towards her chamber,--let your echoes talk<br/>Of my imperious step scorning surprise,<br/>But not of my intent!--Andrea!<br/><br/>[ENTER ANDREA.]<br/><br/>ANDREA:<br/>My lord?<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Bid Beatrice attend me in her chamber<br/>This evening:--no, at midnight and alone.<br/><br/>[EXEUNT.]<br/><br/>SCENE 1.2:<br/>A GARDEN OF THE CENCI PALACE.<br/>ENTER BEATRICE AND ORSINO, AS IN CONVERSATION.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Pervert not truth,<br/>Orsino. You remember where we held<br/>That conversation;--nay, we see the spot<br/>Even from this cypress;--two long years are past<br/>Since, on an April midnight, underneath<br/>The moonlight ruins of Mount Palatine,<br/>I did confess to you my secret mind.<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>You said you loved me then.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>You are a Priest.<br/>Speak to me not of love.<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>I may obtain<br/>The dispensation of the Pope to marry.<br/>Because I am a Priest do you believe<br/>Your image, as the hunter some struck deer,<br/>Follows me not whether I wake or sleep?<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>As I have said, speak to me not of love;<br/>Had you a dispensation I have not;<br/>Nor will I leave this home of misery<br/>Whilst my poor Bernard, and that gentle lady<br/>To whom I owe life, and these virtuous thoughts,<br/>Must suffer what I still have strength to share.<br/>Alas, Orsino! All the love that once<br/>I felt for you, is turned to bitter pain.<br/>Ours was a youthful contract, which you first<br/>Broke, by assuming vows no Pope will loose.<br/>And thus I love you still, but holily,<br/>Even as a sister or a spirit might;<br/>And so I swear a cold fidelity.<br/>And it is well perhaps we shall not marry.<br/>You have a sly, equivocating vein<br/>That suits me not.--Ah, wretched that I am!<br/>Where shall I turn? Even now you look on me<br/>As you were not my friend, and as if you<br/>Discovered that I thought so, with false smiles<br/>Making my true suspicion seem your wrong.<br/>Ah, no! forgive me; sorrow makes me seem<br/>Sterner than else my nature might have been;<br/>I have a weight of melancholy thoughts,<br/>And they forebode,--but what can they forebode<br/>Worse than I now endure?<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>All will be well.<br/>Is the petition yet prepared? You know<br/>My zeal for all you wish, sweet Beatrice;<br/>Doubt not but I will use my utmost skill<br/>So that the Pope attend to your complaint.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Your zeal for all I wish;--Ah me, you are cold!<br/>Your utmost skill...speak but one word...<br/>[ASIDE.]<br/>Alas!<br/>Weak and deserted creature that I am,<br/>Here I stand bickering with my only friend!<br/>[TO ORSINO.]<br/>This night my father gives a sumptuous feast,<br/>Orsino; he has heard some happy news<br/>From Salamanca, from my brothers there,<br/>And with this outward show of love he mocks<br/>His inward hate. 'Tis bold hypocrisy,<br/>For he would gladlier celebrate their deaths,<br/>Which I have heard him pray for on his knees:<br/>Great God! that such a father should be mine!<br/>But there is mighty preparation made,<br/>And all our kin, the Cenci, will be there,<br/>And all the chief nobility of Rome.<br/>And he has bidden me and my pale Mother<br/>Attire ourselves in festival array.<br/>Poor lady! She expects some happy change<br/>In his dark spirit from this act; I none.<br/>At supper I will give you the petition:<br/>Till when--farewell.<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>Farewell.<br/>[EXIT BEATRICE.]<br/>I know the Pope<br/>Will ne'er absolve me from my priestly vow<br/>But by absolving me from the revenue<br/>Of many a wealthy see; and, Beatrice,<br/>I think to win thee at an easier rate.<br/>Nor shall he read her eloquent petition:<br/>He might bestow her on some poor relation<br/>Of his sixth cousin, as he did her sister,<br/>And I should be debarred from all access.<br/>Then as to what she suffers from her father,<br/>In all this there is much exaggeration:--<br/>Old men are testy and will have their way;<br/>A man may stab his enemy, or his vassal,<br/>And live a free life as to wine or women,<br/>And with a peevish temper may return<br/>To a dull home, and rate his wife and children;<br/>Daughters and wives call this foul tyranny.<br/>I shall be well content if on my conscience<br/>There rest no heavier sin than what they suffer<br/>From the devices of my love--a net<br/>From which he shall escape not. Yet I fear<br/>Her subtle mind, her awe-inspiring gaze,<br/>Whose beams anatomize me nerve by nerve<br/>And lay me bare, and make me blush to see<br/>My hidden thoughts.--Ah, no! A friendless girl<br/>Who clings to me, as to her only hope:--<br/>I were a fool, not less than if a panther<br/>Were panic-stricken by the antelope's eye,<br/>If she escape me.<br/><br/>[EXIT.]<br/><br/>SCENE 1.3:<br/>A MAGNIFICENT HALL IN THE CENCI PALACE.<br/>A BANQUET.<br/>ENTER CENCI, LUCRETIA, BEATRICE, ORSINO, CAMILLO, NOBLES.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Welcome, my friends and kinsmen; welcome ye,<br/>Princes and Cardinals, pillars of the church,<br/>Whose presence honours our festivity.<br/>I have too long lived like an anchorite,<br/>And in my absence from your merry meetings<br/>An evil word is gone abroad of me;<br/>But I do hope that you, my noble friends,<br/>When you have shared the entertainment here,<br/>And heard the pious cause for which 'tis given,<br/>And we have pledged a health or two together,<br/>Will think me flesh and blood as well as you;<br/>Sinful indeed, for Adam made all so,<br/>But tender-hearted, meek and pitiful.<br/><br/>FIRST GUEST:<br/>In truth, my Lord, you seem too light of heart,<br/>Too sprightly and companionable a man,<br/>To act the deeds that rumour pins on you.<br/>[TO HIS COMPANION.]<br/>I never saw such blithe and open cheer<br/>In any eye!<br/><br/>SECOND GUEST:<br/>Some most desired event,<br/>In which we all demand a common joy,<br/>Has brought us hither; let us hear it, Count.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>It is indeed a most desired event.<br/>If when a parent from a parent's heart<br/>Lifts from this earth to the great Father of all<br/>A prayer, both when he lays him down to sleep,<br/>And when he rises up from dreaming it;<br/>One supplication, one desire, one hope,<br/>That he would grant a wish for his two sons,<br/>Even all that he demands in their regard--<br/>And suddenly beyond his dearest hope<br/>It is accomplished, he should then rejoice,<br/>And call his friends and kinsmen to a feast,<br/>And task their love to grace his merriment,--<br/>Then honour me thus far--for I am he.<br/><br/>BEATRICE [TO LUCRETIA]:<br/>Great God! How horrible! some dreadful ill<br/>Must have befallen my brothers.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Fear not, child,<br/>He speaks too frankly.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Ah! My blood runs cold.<br/>I fear that wicked laughter round his eye,<br/>Which wrinkles up the skin even to the hair.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Here are the letters brought from Salamanca;<br/>Beatrice, read them to your mother. God!<br/>I thank thee! In one night didst thou perform,<br/>By ways inscrutable, the thing I sought.<br/>My disobedient and rebellious sons<br/>Are dead!--Why, dead!--What means this change of cheer?<br/>You hear me not, I tell you they are dead;<br/>And they will need no food or raiment more:<br/>The tapers that did light them the dark way<br/>Are their last cost. The Pope, I think, will not<br/>Expect I should maintain them in their coffins.<br/>Rejoice with me--my heart is wondrous glad.<br/><br/>[LUCRETIA SINKS, HALF FAINTING; BEATRICE SUPPORTS HER.]<br/><br/>BEATRICE :<br/>It is not true!--Dear Lady, pray look up.<br/>Had it been true, there is a God in Heaven,<br/>He would not live to boast of such a boon.<br/>Unnatural man, thou knowest that it is false.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Ay, as the word of God; whom here I call<br/>To witness that I speak the sober truth;--<br/>And whose most favouring Providence was shown<br/>Even in the manner of their deaths. For Rocco<br/>Was kneeling at the mass, with sixteen others,<br/>When the church fell and crushed him to a mummy,<br/>The rest escaped unhurt. Cristofano<br/>Was stabbed in error by a jealous man,<br/>Whilst she he loved was sleeping with his rival;<br/>All in the self-same hour of the same night;<br/>Which shows that Heaven has special care of me.<br/>I beg those friends who love me, that they mark<br/>The day a feast upon their calendars.<br/>It was the twenty-seventh of December:<br/>Ay, read the letters if you doubt my oath.<br/><br/>[THE ASSEMBLY APPEARS CONFUSED; SEVERAL OF THE GUESTS RISE.]<br/><br/>FIRST GUEST:<br/>Oh, horrible! I will depart--<br/><br/>SECOND GUEST:<br/>And I.--<br/><br/>THIRD GUEST:<br/>No, stay!<br/>I do believe it is some jest; though faith!<br/>'Tis mocking us somewhat too solemnly.<br/>I think his son has married the Infanta,<br/>Or found a mine of gold in El Dorado.<br/>'Tis but to season some such news; stay, stay!<br/>I see 'tis only raillery by his smile.<br/><br/>CENCI [FILLING A BOWL OF WINE, AND LIFTING IT UP]:<br/>Oh, thou bright wine whose purple splendour leaps<br/>And bubbles gaily in this golden bowl<br/>Under the lamplight, as my spirits do,<br/>To hear the death of my accursed sons!<br/>Could I believe thou wert their mingled blood,<br/>Then would I taste thee like a sacrament,<br/>And pledge with thee the mighty Devil in Hell,<br/>Who, if a father's curses, as men say,<br/>Climb with swift wings after their children's souls,<br/>And drag them from the very throne of Heaven,<br/>Now triumphs in my triumph!--But thou art<br/>Superfluous; I have drunken deep of joy,<br/>And I will taste no other wine to-night.<br/>Here, Andrea! Bear the bowl around.<br/><br/>A GUEST [RISING]:<br/>Thou wretch!<br/>Will none among this noble company<br/>Check the abandoned villain?<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>For God's sake,<br/>Let me dismiss the guests! You are insane,<br/>Some ill will come of this.<br/><br/>SECOND GUEST:<br/>Seize, silence him!<br/><br/>FIRST GUEST:<br/>I will!<br/><br/>THIRD GUEST:<br/>And I!<br/><br/>CENCI [ADDRESSING THOSE WHO RISE WITH A THREATENING GESTURE]:<br/>Who moves? Who speaks?<br/>[TURNING TO THE COMPANY.]<br/>'tis nothing,<br/>Enjoy yourselves.--Beware! For my revenge<br/>Is as the sealed commission of a king<br/>That kills, and none dare name the murderer.<br/><br/>[THE BANQUET IS BROKEN UP; SEVERAL OF THE GUESTS ARE DEPARTING.]<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>I do entreat you, go not, noble guests;<br/>What, although tyranny and impious hate<br/>Stand sheltered by a father's hoary hair?<br/>What if 'tis he who clothed us in these limbs<br/>Who tortures them, and triumphs? What, if we,<br/>The desolate and the dead, were his own flesh,<br/>His children and his wife, whom he is bound<br/>To love and shelter? Shall we therefore find<br/>No refuge in this merciless wide world?<br/>O think what deep wrongs must have blotted out<br/>First love, then reverence in a child's prone mind,<br/>Till it thus vanquish shame and fear! O think!<br/>I have borne much, and kissed the sacred hand<br/>Which crushed us to the earth, and thought its stroke<br/>Was perhaps some paternal chastisement!<br/>Have excused much, doubted; and when no doubt<br/>Remained, have sought by patience, love, and tears<br/>To soften him, and when this could not be<br/>I have knelt down through the long sleepless nights<br/>And lifted up to God, the Father of all,<br/>Passionate prayers: and when these were not heard<br/>I have still borne,--until I meet you here,<br/>Princes and kinsmen, at this hideous feast<br/>Given at my brothers' deaths. Two yet remain,<br/>His wife remains and I, whom if ye save not,<br/>Ye may soon share such merriment again<br/>As fathers make over their children's graves.<br/>O Prince Colonna, thou art our near kinsman,<br/>Cardinal, thou art the Pope's chamberlain,<br/>Camillo, thou art chief justiciary,<br/>Take us away!<br/><br/>CENCI [HE HAS BEEN CONVERSING WITH CAMILLO DURING THE FIRST PART OF<br/>BEATRICE'S SPEECH; HE HEARS THE CONCLUSION, AND NOW ADVANCES]:<br/>I hope my good friends here<br/>Will think of their own daughters--or perhaps<br/>Of their own throats--before they lend an ear<br/>To this wild girl.<br/><br/>BEATRICE [NOT NOTICING THE WORDS OF CENCI]:<br/>Dare no one look on me?<br/>None answer? Can one tyrant overbear<br/>The sense of many best and wisest men?<br/>Or is it that I sue not in some form<br/>Of scrupulous law, that ye deny my suit?<br/>O God! That I were buried with my brothers!<br/>And that the flowers of this departed spring<br/>Were fading on my grave! And that my father<br/>Were celebrating now one feast for all!<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>A bitter wish for one so young and gentle.<br/>Can we do nothing?<br/><br/>COLONNA:<br/>Nothing that I see.<br/>Count Cenci were a dangerous enemy:<br/>Yet I would second any one.<br/><br/>A CARDINAL:<br/>And I.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Retire to your chamber, insolent girl!<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Retire thou, impious man! Ay, hide thyself<br/>Where never eye can look upon thee more!<br/>Wouldst thou have honour and obedience<br/>Who art a torturer? Father, never dream,<br/>Though thou mayst overbear this company,<br/>But ill must come of ill.--Frown not on me!<br/>Haste, hide thyself, lest with avenging looks<br/>My brothers' ghosts should hunt thee from thy seat!<br/>Cover thy face from every living eye,<br/>And start if thou but hear a human step:<br/>Seek out some dark and silent corner, there,<br/>Bow thy white head before offended God,<br/>And we will kneel around, and fervently<br/>Pray that he pity both ourselves and thee.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>My friends, I do lament this insane girl<br/>Has spoilt the mirth of our festivity.<br/>Good night, farewell; I will not make you longer<br/>Spectators of our dull domestic quarrels.<br/>Another time.--<br/>[EXEUNT ALL BUT CENCI AND BEATRICE.]<br/>My brain is swimming round;<br/>Give me a bowl of wine!<br/>[TO BEATRICE.]<br/>Thou painted viper!<br/>Beast that thou art! Fair and yet terrible!<br/>I know a charm shall make thee meek and tame,<br/>Now get thee from my sight!<br/>[EXIT BEATRICE.]<br/>Here, Andrea,<br/>Fill up this goblet with Greek wine. I said<br/>I would not drink this evening; but I must;<br/>For, strange to say, I feel my spirits fail<br/>With thinking what I have decreed to do.--<br/>[DRINKING THE WINE.]<br/>Be thou the resolution of quick youth<br/>Within my veins, and manhood's purpose stern,<br/>And age's firm, cold, subtle villainy;<br/>As if thou wert indeed my children's blood<br/>Which I did thirst to drink! The charm works well;<br/>It must be done; it shall be done, I swear!<br/><br/>[EXIT.]<br/><br/>END OF ACT 1.<br/><br/>ACT 2.<br/><br/>SCENE 2.1:<br/>AN APARTMENT IN THE CENCI PALACE.<br/>ENTER LUCRETIA AND BERNARDO.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Weep not, my gentle boy; he struck but me<br/>Who have borne deeper wrongs. In truth, if he<br/>Had killed me, he had done a kinder deed.<br/>O God Almighty, do Thou look upon us,<br/>We have no other friend but only Thee!<br/>Yet weep not; though I love you as my own,<br/>I am not your true mother.<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>Oh, more, more,<br/>Than ever mother was to any child,<br/>That have you been to me! Had he not been<br/>My father, do you think that I should weep!<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Alas! Poor boy, what else couldst thou have done?<br/><br/>[ENTER BEATRICE.]<br/><br/>BEATRICE [IN A HURRIED VOICE]:<br/>Did he pass this way? Have you seen him, brother?<br/>Ah, no! that is his step upon the stairs;<br/>'Tis nearer now; his hand is on the door;<br/>Mother, if I to thee have ever been<br/>A duteous child, now save me! Thou, great God,<br/>Whose image upon earth a father is,<br/>Dost thou indeed abandon me? He comes;<br/>The door is opening now; I see his face;<br/>He frowns on others, but he smiles on me,<br/>Even as he did after the feast last night.<br/>[ENTER A SERVANT.]<br/>Almighty God, how merciful Thou art!<br/>'Tis but Orsino's servant.--Well, what news?<br/><br/>SERVANT:<br/>My master bids me say, the Holy Father<br/>Has sent back your petition thus unopened.<br/>[GIVING A PAPER.]<br/>And he demands at what hour 'twere secure<br/>To visit you again?<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>At the Ave Mary.<br/>[EXIT SERVANT.]<br/>So, daughter, our last hope has failed. Ah me!<br/>How pale you look; you tremble, and you stand<br/>Wrapped in some fixed and fearful meditation,<br/>As if one thought were over strong for you:<br/>Your eyes have a chill glare; O, dearest child!<br/>Are you gone mad? If not, pray speak to me.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>You see I am not mad: I speak to you.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>You talked of something that your father did<br/>After that dreadful feast? Could it be worse<br/>Than when he smiled, and cried, 'My sons are dead!'<br/>And every one looked in his neighbour's face<br/>To see if others were as white as he?<br/>At the first word he spoke I felt the blood<br/>Rush to my heart, and fell into a trance;<br/>And when it passed I sat all weak and wild;<br/>Whilst you alone stood up, and with strong words<br/>Checked his unnatural pride; and I could see<br/>The devil was rebuked that lives in him.<br/>Until this hour thus you have ever stood<br/>Between us and your father's moody wrath<br/>Like a protecting presence; your firm mind<br/>Has been our only refuge and defence:<br/>What can have thus subdued it? What can now<br/>Have given you that cold melancholy look,<br/>Succeeding to your unaccustomed fear?<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>What is it that you say? I was just thinking<br/>'Twere better not to struggle any more.<br/>Men, like my father, have been dark and bloody,<br/>Yet never--Oh! Before worse comes of it<br/>'Twere wise to die: it ends in that at last.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Oh, talk not so, dear child! Tell me at once<br/>What did your father do or say to you?<br/>He stayed not after that accursed feast<br/>One moment in your chamber.--Speak to me.<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>Oh, sister, sister, prithee, speak to us!<br/><br/>BEATRICE [SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY, WITH A FORCED CALMNESS]:<br/>It was one word, Mother, one little word;<br/>One look, one smile.<br/>[WILDLY.]<br/>Oh! He has trampled me<br/>Under his feet, and made the blood stream down<br/>My pallid cheeks. And he has given us all<br/>Ditch-water, and the fever-stricken flesh<br/>Of buffaloes, and bade us eat or starve,<br/>And we have eaten.--He has made me look<br/>On my beloved Bernardo, when the rust<br/>Of heavy chains has gangrened his sweet limbs,<br/>And I have never yet despaired--but now!<br/>What could I say?<br/>[RECOVERING HERSELF.]<br/>Ah, no! 'tis nothing new.<br/>The sufferings we all share have made me wild:<br/>He only struck and cursed me as he passed;<br/>He said, he looked, he did;--nothing at all<br/>Beyond his wont, yet it disordered me.<br/>Alas! I am forgetful of my duty,<br/>I should preserve my senses for your sake.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Nay, Beatrice; have courage, my sweet girl.<br/>If any one despairs it should be I<br/>Who loved him once, and now must live with him<br/>Till God in pity call for him or me.<br/>For you may, like your sister, find some husband,<br/>And smile, years hence, with children round your knees;<br/>Whilst I, then dead, and all this hideous coil<br/>Shall be remembered only as a dream.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Talk not to me, dear lady, of a husband.<br/>Did you not nurse me when my mother died?<br/>Did you not shield me and that dearest boy?<br/>And had we any other friend but you<br/>In infancy, with gentle words and looks,<br/>To win our father not to murder us?<br/>And shall I now desert you? May the ghost<br/>Of my dead Mother plead against my soul<br/>If I abandon her who filled the place<br/>She left, with more, even, than a mother's love!<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>And I am of my sister's mind. Indeed<br/>I would not leave you in this wretchedness,<br/>Even though the Pope should make me free to live<br/>In some blithe place, like others of my age,<br/>With sports, and delicate food, and the fresh air.<br/>Oh, never think that I will leave you, Mother!<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>My dear, dear children!<br/><br/>[ENTER CENCI, SUDDENLY.]<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>What! Beatrice here!<br/>Come hither!<br/>[SHE SHRINKS BACK, AND COVERS HER FACE.]<br/>Nay, hide not your face, 'tis fair;<br/>Look up! Why, yesternight you dared to look<br/>With disobedient insolence upon me,<br/>Bending a stern and an inquiring brow<br/>On what I meant; whilst I then sought to hide<br/>That which I came to tell you--but in vain.<br/><br/>BEATRICE [WILDLY STAGGERING TOWARDS THE DOOR]:<br/>Oh, that the earth would gape! Hide me, O God!<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Then it was I whose inarticulate words<br/>Fell from my lips, and who with tottering steps<br/>Fled from your presence, as you now from mine.<br/>Stay, I command you--from this day and hour<br/>Never again, I think, with fearless eye,<br/>And brow superior, and unaltered cheek,<br/>And that lip made for tenderness or scorn,<br/>Shalt thou strike dumb the meanest of mankind;<br/>Me least of all. Now get thee to thy chamber!<br/>Thou too, loathed image of thy cursed mother,<br/>[TO BERNARDO.]<br/>Thy milky, meek face makes me sick with hate!<br/>[EXEUNT BEATRICE AND BERNARDO.]<br/>[ASIDE.]<br/>So much has passed between us as must make<br/>Me bold, her fearful.--'Tis an awful thing<br/>To touch such mischief as I now conceive:<br/>So men sit shivering on the dewy bank,<br/>And try the chill stream with their feet; once in...<br/>How the delighted spirit pants for joy!<br/><br/>LUCRETIA [ADVANCING TIMIDLY TOWARDS HIM]:<br/>O husband!

Nor Giacomo?<br/>Nor those two most unnatural sons, who stirred<br/>Enmity up against me with the Pope?<br/>Whom in one night merciful God cut off:<br/>Innocent lambs! They thought not any ill.<br/>You were not here conspiring? You said nothing<br/>Of how I might be dungeoned as a madman;<br/>Or be condemned to death for some offence,<br/>And you would be the witnesses?--This failing,<br/>How just it were to hire assassins, or<br/>Put sudden poison in my evening drink?<br/>Or smother me when overcome by wine?<br/>Seeing we had no other judge but God,<br/>And He had sentenced me, and there were none<br/>But you to be the executioners<br/>Of His decree enregistered in heaven?<br/>Oh, no! You said not this?<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>So help me God,<br/>I never thought the things you charge me with!<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>If you dare to speak that wicked lie again<br/>I'll kill you. What! It was not by your counsel<br/>That Beatrice disturbed the feast last night?<br/>You did not hope to stir some enemies<br/>Against me, and escape, and laugh to scorn<br/>What every nerve of you now trembles at?<br/>You judged that men were bolder than they are;<br/>Few dare to stand between their grave and me.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Look not so dreadfully! By my salvation<br/>I knew not aught that Beatrice designed;<br/>Nor do I think she designed any thing<br/>Until she heard you talk of her dead brothers.<br/><br/>CENCI:<br/>Blaspheming liar! You are damned for this!<br/>But I will take you where you may persuade<br/>The stones you tread on to deliver you:<br/>For men shall there be none but those who dare<br/>All things--not question that which I command.<br/>On Wednesday next I shall set out: you know<br/>That savage rock, the Castle of Petrella:<br/>'Tis safely walled, and moated round about:<br/>Its dungeons underground, and its thick towers<br/>Never told tales; though they have heard and seen<br/>What might make dumb things speak.--Why do you linger?<br/>Make speediest preparation for the journey!<br/>[EXIT LUCRETIA.]<br/>The all-beholding sun yet shines; I hear<br/>A busy stir of men about the streets;<br/>I see the bright sky through the window panes:<br/>It is a garish, broad, and peering day;<br/>Loud, light, suspicious, full of eyes and ears,<br/>And every little corner, nook, and hole<br/>Is penetrated with the insolent light.<br/>Come darkness! Yet, what is the day to me?<br/>And wherefore should I wish for night, who do<br/>A deed which shall confound both night and day?<br/>'Tis she shall grope through a bewildering mist<br/>Of horror: if there be a sun in heaven<br/>She shall not dare to look upon its beams;<br/>Nor feel its warmth. Let her then wish for night;<br/>The act I think shall soon extinguish all<br/>For me: I bear a darker deadlier gloom<br/>Than the earth's shade, or interlunar air,<br/>Or constellations quenched in murkiest cloud,<br/>In which I walk secure and unbeheld<br/>Towards my purpose.--Would that it were done!<br/><br/>[EXIT.]<br/><br/>SCENE 2.2:<br/>A CHAMBER IN THE VATICAN.<br/>ENTER CAMILLO AND GIACOMO, IN CONVERSATION.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>There is an obsolete and doubtful law<br/>By which you might obtain a bare provision<br/>Of food and clothing--<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>Nothing more? Alas!<br/>Bare must be the provision which strict law<br/>Awards, and aged, sullen avarice pays.<br/>Why did my father not apprentice me<br/>To some mechanic trade? I should have then<br/>Been trained in no highborn necessities<br/>Which I could meet not by my daily toil.<br/>The eldest son of a rich nobleman<br/>Is heir to all his incapacities;<br/>He has wide wants, and narrow powers. If you,<br/>Cardinal Camillo, were reduced at once<br/>From thrice-driven beds of down, and delicate food,<br/>An hundred servants, and six palaces,<br/>To that which nature doth indeed require?--<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Nay, there is reason in your plea; 'twere hard.<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>'Tis hard for a firm man to bear: but I<br/>Have a dear wife, a lady of high birth,<br/>Whose dowry in ill hour I lent my father<br/>Without a bond or witness to the deed:<br/>And children, who inherit her fine senses,<br/>The fairest creatures in this breathing world;<br/>And she and they reproach me not. Cardinal,<br/>Do you not think the Pope would interpose<br/>And stretch authority beyond the law?<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Though your peculiar case is hard, I know<br/>The Pope will not divert the course of law.<br/>After that impious feast the other night<br/>I spoke with him, and urged him then to check<br/>Your father's cruel hand; he frowned and said,<br/>'Children are disobedient, and they sting<br/>Their fathers' hearts to madness and despair,<br/>Requiting years of care with contumely.<br/>I pity the Count Cenci from my heart;<br/>His outraged love perhaps awakened hate,<br/>And thus he is exasperated to ill.<br/>In the great war between the old and young<br/>I, who have white hairs and a tottering body,<br/>Will keep at least blameless neutrality.'<br/>[ENTER ORSINO.]<br/>You, my good Lord Orsino, heard those words.<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>What words?<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>Alas, repeat them not again!<br/>There then is no redress for me, at least<br/>None but that which I may achieve myself,<br/>Since I am driven to the brink.--But, say,<br/>My innocent sister and my only brother<br/>Are dying underneath my father's eye.<br/>The memorable torturers of this land,<br/>Galeaz Visconti, Borgia, Ezzelin,<br/>Never inflicted on their meanest slave<br/>What these endure; shall they have no protection?<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Why, if they would petition to the Pope<br/>I see not how he could refuse it--yet<br/>He holds it of most dangerous example<br/>In aught to weaken the paternal power,<br/>Being, as 'twere, the shadow of his own.<br/>I pray you now excuse me. I have business<br/>That will not bear delay.<br/><br/>[EXIT CAMILLO.]<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>But you, Orsino,<br/>Have the petition: wherefore not present it?<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>I have presented it, and backed it with<br/>My earnest prayers, and urgent interest;<br/>It was returned unanswered. I doubt not<br/>But that the strange and execrable deeds<br/>Alleged in it--in truth they might well baffle<br/>Any belief--have turned the Pope's displeasure<br/>Upon the accusers from the criminal:<br/>So I should guess from what Camillo said.<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>My friend, that palace-walking devil Gold<br/>Has whispered silence to his Holiness:<br/>And we are left, as scorpions ringed with fire.<br/>What should we do but strike ourselves to death?<br/>For he who is our murderous persecutor<br/>Is shielded by a father's holy name,<br/>Or I would--<br/><br/>[STOPS ABRUPTLY.]<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>What?

I returned<br/>With this ill news, and we sate sad together<br/>Solacing our despondency with tears<br/>Of such affection and unbroken faith<br/>As temper life's worst bitterness; when he,<br/>As he is wont, came to upbraid and curse,<br/>Mocking our poverty, and telling us<br/>Such was God's scourge for disobedient sons.<br/>And then, that I might strike him dumb with shame,<br/>I spoke of my wife's dowry; but he coined<br/>A brief yet specious tale, how I had wasted<br/>The sum in secret riot; and he saw<br/>My wife was touched, and he went smiling forth.<br/>And when I knew the impression he had made,<br/>And felt my wife insult with silent scorn<br/>My ardent truth, and look averse and cold,<br/>I went forth too: but soon returned again;<br/>Yet not so soon but that my wife had taught<br/>My children her harsh thoughts, and they all cried,<br/>'Give us clothes, father! Give us better food!<br/>What you in one night squander were enough<br/>For months!' I looked, and saw that home was hell.<br/>And to that hell will I return no more<br/>Until mine enemy has rendered up<br/>Atonement, or, as he gave life to me<br/>I will, reversing Nature's law...<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>Trust me,<br/>The compensation which thou seekest here<br/>Will be denied.<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>Then...Are you not my friend?<br/>Did you not hint at the alternative,<br/>Upon the brink of which you see I stand,<br/>The other day when we conversed together?<br/>My wrongs were then less. That word parricide,<br/>Although I am resolved, haunts me like fear.<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>It must be fear itself, for the bare word<br/>Is hollow mockery.

Know that since we met<br/>Cenci has done an outrage to his daughter.<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>What outrage?<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>That she speaks not, but you may<br/>Conceive such half conjectures as I do,<br/>From her fixed paleness, and the lofty grief<br/>Of her stern brow bent on the idle air,<br/>And her severe unmodulated voice,<br/>Drowning both tenderness and dread; and last<br/>From this; that whilst her step-mother and I,<br/>Bewildered in our horror, talked together<br/>With obscure hints; both self-misunderstood<br/>And darkly guessing, stumbling, in our talk,<br/>Over the truth, and yet to its revenge,<br/>She interrupted us, and with a look<br/>Which told, before she spoke it, he must die:...<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>It is enough. My doubts are well appeased;<br/>There is a higher reason for the act<br/>Than mine; there is a holier judge than me,<br/>A more unblamed avenger. Beatrice,<br/>Who in the gentleness of thy sweet youth<br/>Hast never trodden on a worm, or bruised<br/>A living flower, but thou hast pitied it<br/>With needless tears! Fair sister, thou in whom<br/>Men wondered how such loveliness and wisdom<br/>Did not destroy each other! Is there made<br/>Ravage of thee? O, heart, I ask no more<br/>Justification! Shall I wait, Orsino,<br/>Till he return, and stab him at the door?<br/><br/>ORSINO:<br/>Not so; some accident might interpose<br/>To rescue him from what is now most sure;<br/>And you are unprovided where to fly,<br/>How to excuse or to conceal. Nay, listen:<br/>All is contrived; success is so assured<br/>That...<br/><br/>[ENTER BEATRICE.]<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>'Tis my brother's voice!

My wife and children sleep:<br/>They are now living in unmeaning dreams:<br/>But I must wake, still doubting if that deed<br/>Be just which is most necessary. O,<br/>Thou unreplenished lamp! whose narrow fire<br/>Is shaken by the wind, and on whose edge<br/>Devouring darkness hovers! Thou small flame,<br/>Which, as a dying pulse rises and falls,<br/>Still flickerest up and down, how very soon,<br/>Did I not feed thee, wouldst thou fail and be<br/>As thou hadst never been!

Let her not look on me!<br/>I am a guilty miserable wretch;<br/>I have said all I know; now, let me die!<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>My Lords, if by my nature I had been<br/>So stern, as to have planned the crime alleged,<br/>Which your suspicions dictate to this slave,<br/>And the rack makes him utter, do you think<br/>I should have left this two-edged instrument<br/>Of my misdeed; this man, this bloody knife<br/>With my own name engraven on the heft,<br/>Lying unsheathed amid a world of foes,<br/>For my own death? That with such horrible need<br/>For deepest silence, I should have neglected<br/>So trivial a precaution, as the making<br/>His tomb the keeper of a secret written<br/>On a thief's memory? What is his poor life?<br/>What are a thousand lives? A parricide<br/>Had trampled them like dust; and, see, he lives!<br/>[TURNING TO MARZIO.]<br/>And thou...<br/><br/>MARZIO:<br/>Oh, spare me! Speak to me no more!<br/>That stern yet piteous look, those solemn tones,<br/>Wound worse than torture.<br/>[TO THE JUDGES.]<br/>I have told it all;<br/>For pity's sake lead me away to death.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Guards, lead him nearer the Lady Beatrice;<br/>He shrinks from her regard like autumn's leaf<br/>From the keen breath of the serenest north.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>O thou who tremblest on the giddy verge<br/>Of life and death, pause ere thou answerest me;<br/>So mayst thou answer God with less dismay:<br/>What evil have we done thee? I, alas!<br/>Have lived but on this earth a few sad years,<br/>And so my lot was ordered, that a father<br/>First turned the moments of awakening life<br/>To drops, each poisoning youth's sweet hope; and then<br/>Stabbed with one blow my everlasting soul;<br/>And my untainted fame; and even that peace<br/>Which sleeps within the core of the heart's heart;<br/>But the wound was not mortal; so my hate<br/>Became the only worship I could lift<br/>To our great father, who in pity and love,<br/>Armed thee, as thou dost say, to cut him off;<br/>And thus his wrong becomes my accusation;<br/>And art thou the accuser? If thou hopest<br/>Mercy in heaven, show justice upon earth:<br/>Worse than a bloody hand is a hard heart.<br/>If thou hast done murders, made thy life's path<br/>Over the trampled laws of God and man,<br/>Rush not before thy Judge, and say: 'My maker,<br/>I have done this and more; for there was one<br/>Who was most pure and innocent on earth;<br/>And because she endured what never any<br/>Guilty or innocent endured before:<br/>Because her wrongs could not be told, not thought;<br/>Because thy hand at length did rescue her;<br/>I with my words killed her and all her kin.'<br/>Think, I adjure you, what it is to slay<br/>The reverence living in the minds of men<br/>Towards our ancient house, and stainless fame!<br/>Think what it is to strangle infant pity,<br/>Cradled in the belief of guileless looks,<br/>Till it become a crime to suffer. Think<br/>What 'tis to blot with infamy and blood<br/>All that which shows like innocence, and is,<br/>Hear me, great God! I swear, most innocent,<br/>So that the world lose all discrimination<br/>Between the sly, fierce, wild regard of guilt,<br/>And that which now compels thee to reply<br/>To what I ask: Am I, or am I not<br/>A parricide?<br/><br/>MARZIO:<br/>Thou art not!<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>What is this?<br/><br/>MARZIO:<br/>I here declare those whom I did accuse<br/>Are innocent. 'Tis I alone am guilty.<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>Drag him away to torments; let them be<br/>Subtle and long drawn out, to tear the folds<br/>Of the heart's inmost cell. Unbind him not<br/>Till he confess.<br/><br/>MARZIO:<br/>Torture me as ye will:<br/>A keener pang has wrung a higher truth<br/>From my last breath. She is most innocent!<br/>Bloodhounds, not men, glut yourselves well with me;<br/>I will not give you that fine piece of nature<br/>To rend and ruin.<br/><br/>[EXIT MARZIO, GUARDED.]<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>What say ye now, my Lords?<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>Let tortures strain the truth till it be white<br/>As snow thrice sifted by the frozen wind.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Yet stained with blood.<br/><br/>JUDGE [TO BEATRICE]:<br/>Know you this paper, Lady?<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Entrap me not with questions. Who stands here<br/>As my accuser? Ha! wilt thou be he,<br/>Who art my judge? Accuser, witness, judge,<br/>What, all in one? Here is Orsino's name;<br/>Where is Orsino? Let his eye meet mine.<br/>What means this scrawl? Alas! ye know not what,<br/>And therefore on the chance that it may be<br/>Some evil, will ye kill us?<br/><br/>[ENTER AN OFFICER.]<br/><br/>OFFICER:<br/>Marzio's dead.<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>What did he say?<br/><br/>OFFICER:<br/>Nothing. As soon as we<br/>Had bound him on the wheel, he smiled on us,<br/>As one who baffles a deep adversary;<br/>And holding his breath, died.<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>There remains nothing<br/>But to apply the question to those prisoners,<br/>Who yet remain stubborn.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>I overrule<br/>Further proceedings, and in the behalf<br/>Of these most innocent and noble persons<br/>Will use my interest with the Holy Father.<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>Let the Pope's pleasure then be done. Meanwhile<br/>Conduct these culprits each to separate cells;<br/>And be the engines ready; for this night<br/>If the Pope's resolution be as grave,<br/>Pious, and just as once, I'll wring the truth<br/>Out of those nerves and sinews, groan by groan.<br/><br/>[EXEUNT.]<br/><br/>SCENE 5.3:<br/>THE CELL OF A PRISON.<br/>BEATRICE IS DISCOVERED ASLEEP ON A COUCH.<br/>ENTER BERNARDO.<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>How gently slumber rests upon her face,<br/>Like the last thoughts of some day sweetly spent<br/>Closing in night and dreams, and so prolonged.<br/>After such torments as she bore last night,<br/>How light and soft her breathing comes. Ay me!<br/>Methinks that I shall never sleep again.<br/>But I must shake the heavenly dew of rest<br/>From this sweet folded flower, thus...wake, awake!<br/>What, sister, canst thou sleep?<br/><br/>BEATRICE [AWAKING]:<br/>I was just dreaming<br/>That we were all in Paradise. Thou knowest<br/>This cell seems like a kind of Paradise<br/>After our father's presence.<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>Dear, dear sister,<br/>Would that thy dream were not a dream! O God!<br/>How shall I tell?<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>What wouldst thou tell, sweet brother?<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>Look not so calm and happy, or even whilst<br/>I stand considering what I have to say<br/>My heart will break.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>See now, thou mak'st me weep:<br/>How very friendless thou wouldst be, dear child,<br/>If I were dead. Say what thou hast to say.<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>They have confessed; they could endure no more<br/>The tortures...<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Ha! What was there to confess?<br/>They must have told some weak and wicked lie<br/>To flatter their tormentors. Have they said<br/>That they were guilty? O white innocence,<br/>That thou shouldst wear the mask of guilt to hide<br/>Thine awful and serenest countenance<br/>From those who know thee not!<br/>[ENTER JUDGE WITH LUCRETIA AND GIACOMO, GUARDED.]<br/>Ignoble hearts!<br/>For some brief spasms of pain, which are at least<br/>As mortal as the limbs through which they pass,<br/>Are centuries of high splendour laid in dust?<br/>And that eternal honour which should live<br/>Sunlike, above the reek of mortal fame,<br/>Changed to a mockery and a byword? What!<br/>Will you give up these bodies to be dragged<br/>At horses' heels, so that our hair should sweep<br/>The footsteps of the vain and senseless crowd,<br/>Who, that they may make our calamity<br/>Their worship and their spectacle, will leave<br/>The churches and the theatres as void<br/>As their own hearts? Shall the light multitude<br/>Fling, at their choice, curses or faded pity,<br/>Sad funeral flowers to deck a living corpse,<br/>Upon us as we pass to pass away,<br/>And leave...what memory of our having been?<br/>Infamy, blood, terror, despair? O thou,<br/>Who wert a mother to the parentless,<br/>Kill not thy child! Let not her wrongs kill thee!<br/>Brother, lie down with me upon the rack,<br/>And let us each be silent as a corpse;<br/>It soon will be as soft as any grave.<br/>'Tis but the falsehood it can wring from fear<br/>Makes the rack cruel.<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>They will tear the truth<br/>Even from thee at last, those cruel pains:<br/>For pity's sake say thou art guilty now.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Oh, speak the truth! Let us all quickly die;<br/>And after death, God is our judge, not they;<br/>He will have mercy on us.<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>If indeed<br/>It can be true, say so, dear sister mine;<br/>And then the Pope will surely pardon you,<br/>And all be well.<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>Confess, or I will warp<br/>Your limbs with such keen tortures...<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Tortures! Turn<br/>The rack henceforth into a spinning-wheel!<br/>Torture your dog, that he may tell when last<br/>He lapped the blood his master shed...not me!<br/>My pangs are of the mind, and of the heart,<br/>And of the soul; ay, of the inmost soul,<br/>Which weeps within tears as of burning gall<br/>To see, in this ill world where none are true,<br/>My kindred false to their deserted selves.<br/>And with considering all the wretched life<br/>Which I have lived, and its now wretched end,<br/>And the small justice shown by Heaven and Earth<br/>To me or mine; and what a tyrant thou art,<br/>And what slaves these; and what a world we make,<br/>The oppressor and the oppressed...such pangs compel<br/>My answer. What is it thou wouldst with me?<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>Art thou not guilty of thy father's death?<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Or wilt thou rather tax high-judging God<br/>That He permitted such an act as that<br/>Which I have suffered, and which He beheld;<br/>Made it unutterable, and took from it<br/>All refuge, all revenge, all consequence,<br/>But that which thou hast called my father's death?<br/>Which is or is not what men call a crime,<br/>Which either I have done, or have not done;<br/>Say what ye will. I shall deny no more.<br/>If ye desire it thus, thus let it be,<br/>And so an end of all. Now do your will;<br/>No other pains shall force another word.<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>She is convicted, but has not confessed.<br/>Be it enough. Until their final sentence<br/>Let none have converse with them. You, young Lord,<br/>Linger not here!<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Oh, tear him not away!<br/><br/>JUDGE:<br/>Guards! do your duty.<br/><br/>BERNARDO [EMBRACING BEATRICE]:<br/>Oh! would ye divide<br/>Body from soul?<br/><br/>OFFICER:<br/>That is the headsman's business.<br/><br/>[EXEUNT ALL BUT LUCRETIA, BEATRICE, AND GIACOMO.]<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>Have I confessed? Is it all over now?<br/>No hope! No refuge! O weak, wicked tongue<br/>Which hast destroyed me, would that thou hadst been<br/>Cut out and thrown to dogs first! To have killed<br/>My father first, and then betrayed my sister;<br/>Ay, thee! the one thing innocent and pure<br/>In this black, guilty world, to that which I<br/>So well deserve! My wife! my little ones!<br/>Destitute, helpless, and I...Father! God!<br/>Canst Thou forgive even the unforgiving,<br/>When their full hearts break thus, thus!...<br/><br/>[COVERS HIS FACE AND WEEPS.]<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>O my child!<br/>To what a dreadful end are we all come!<br/>Why did I yield? Why did I not sustain<br/>Those torments? Oh, that I were all dissolved<br/>Into these fast and unavailing tears,<br/>Which flow and feel not!<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>What 'twas weak to do,<br/>'Tis weaker to lament, once being done;<br/>Take cheer! The God who knew my wrong, and made<br/>Our speedy act the angel of His wrath,<br/>Seems, and but seems, to have abandoned us.<br/>Let us not think that we shall die for this.<br/>Brother, sit near me; give me your firm hand,<br/>You had a manly heart. Bear up! Bear up!<br/>O dearest Lady, put your gentle head<br/>Upon my lap, and try to sleep awhile:<br/>Your eyes look pale, hollow, and overworn,<br/>With heaviness of watching and slow grief.<br/>Come, I will sing you some low, sleepy tune,<br/>Not cheerful, nor yet sad; some dull old thing,<br/>Some outworn and unused monotony,<br/>Such as our country gossips sing and spin,<br/>Till they almost forget they live: lie down!<br/>So, that will do. Have I forgot the words?<br/>Faith! They are sadder than I thought they were.<br/><br/>SONG:<br/>False friend, wilt thou smile or weep<br/>When my life is laid asleep?<br/>Little cares for a smile or a tear,<br/>The clay-cold corpse upon the bier!<br/>Farewell! Heighho!<br/>What is this whispers low?<br/>There is a snake in thy smile, my dear;<br/>And bitter poison within thy tear.<br/><br/>Sweet sleep, were death like to thee,<br/>Or if thou couldst mortal be,<br/>I would close these eyes of pain;<br/>When to wake? Never again.<br/>O World! Farewell!<br/>Listen to the passing bell!<br/>It says, thou and I must part,<br/>With a light and a heavy heart.<br/><br/>[THE SCENE CLOSES.]<br/><br/>SCENE 5.4:<br/>A HALL OF THE PRISON.<br/>ENTER CAMILLO AND BERNARDO.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>The Pope is stern; not to be moved or bent.<br/>He looked as calm and keen as is the engine<br/>Which tortures and which kills, exempt itself<br/>From aught that it inflicts; a marble form,<br/>A rite, a law, a custom: not a man.<br/>He frowned, as if to frown had been the trick<br/>Of his machinery, on the advocates<br/>Presenting the defences, which he tore<br/>And threw behind, muttering with hoarse, harsh voice:<br/>'Which among ye defended their old father<br/>Killed in his sleep?' Then to another: 'Thou<br/>Dost this in virtue of thy place; 'tis well.'<br/>He turned to me then, looking deprecation,<br/>And said these three words, coldly: 'They must die.'<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>And yet you left him not?<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>I urged him still;<br/>Pleading, as I could guess, the devilish wrong<br/>Which prompted your unnatural parent's death.<br/>And he replied: 'Paolo Santa Croce<br/>Murdered his mother yester evening,<br/>And he is fled. Parricide grows so rife<br/>That soon, for some just cause no doubt, the young<br/>Will strangle us all, dozing in our chairs.<br/>Authority, and power, and hoary hair<br/>Are grown crimes capital. You are my nephew,<br/>You come to ask their pardon; stay a moment;<br/>Here is their sentence; never see me more<br/>Till, to the letter, it be all fulfilled.'<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>O God, not so! I did believe indeed<br/>That all you said was but sad preparation<br/>For happy news. Oh, there are words and looks<br/>To bend the sternest purpose! Once I knew them,<br/>Now I forget them at my dearest need.<br/>What think you if I seek him out, and bathe<br/>His feet and robe with hot and bitter tears?<br/>Importune him with prayers, vexing his brain<br/>With my perpetual cries, until in rage<br/>He strike me with his pastoral cross, and trample<br/>Upon my prostrate head, so that my blood<br/>May stain the senseless dust on which he treads,<br/>And remorse waken mercy? I will do it!<br/>Oh, wait till I return!<br/><br/>[RUSHES OUT.]<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Alas, poor boy!<br/>A wreck-devoted seaman thus might pray<br/>To the deaf sea.<br/><br/>[ENTER LUCRETIA, BEATRICE, AND GIACOMO, GUARDED.]<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>I hardly dare to fear<br/>That thou bring'st other news than a just pardon.<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>May God in heaven be less inexorable<br/>To the Pope's prayers than he has been to mine.<br/>Here is the sentence and the warrant.<br/><br/>BEATRICE [WILDLY]:<br/>O<br/>My God! Can it be possible I have<br/>To die so suddenly? So young to go<br/>Under the obscure, cold, rotting, wormy ground!<br/>To be nailed down into a narrow place;<br/>To see no more sweet sunshine; hear no more<br/>Blithe voice of living thing; muse not again<br/>Upon familiar thoughts, sad, yet thus lost--<br/>How fearful! to be nothing! Or to be...<br/>What? Oh, where am I? Let me not go mad!<br/>Sweet Heaven, forgive weak thoughts! If there should be<br/>No God, no Heaven, no Earth in the void world;<br/>The wide, gray, lampless, deep, unpeopled world!<br/>If all things then should be...my father's spirit,<br/>His eye, his voice, his touch surrounding me;<br/>The atmosphere and breath of my dead life!<br/>If sometimes, as a shape more like himself,<br/>Even the form which tortured me on earth,<br/>Masked in gray hairs and wrinkles, he should come<br/>And wind me in his hellish arms, and fix<br/>His eyes on mine, and drag me down, down, down!<br/>For was he not alone omnipotent<br/>On Earth, and ever present? Even though dead,<br/>Does not his spirit live in all that breathe,<br/>And work for me and mine still the same ruin,<br/>Scorn, pain, despair? Who ever yet returned<br/>To teach the laws of Death's untrodden realm?<br/>Unjust perhaps as those which drive us now,<br/>Oh, whither, whither?<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Trust in God's sweet love,<br/>The tender promises of Christ: ere night,<br/>Think, we shall be in Paradise.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>'Tis past!<br/>Whatever comes, my heart shall sink no more.<br/>And yet, I know not why, your words strike chill:<br/>How tedious, false, and cold seem all things. I<br/>Have met with much injustice in this world;<br/>No difference has been made by God or man,<br/>Or any power moulding my wretched lot,<br/>'Twixt good or evil, as regarded me.<br/>I am cut off from the only world I know,<br/>From light, and life, and love, in youth's sweet prime.<br/>You do well telling me to trust in God;<br/>I hope I do trust in him. In whom else<br/>Can any trust? And yet my heart is cold.<br/><br/>[DURING THE LATTER SPEECHES GIACOMO HAS RETIRED CONVERSING WITH<br/>CAMILLO, WHO NOW GOES OUT;<br/>GIACOMO ADVANCES.]<br/><br/>GIACOMO:<br/>Know you not, Mother...Sister, know you not?<br/>Bernardo even now is gone to implore<br/>The Pope to grant our pardon.<br/><br/>LUCRETIA:<br/>Child, perhaps<br/>It will be granted. We may all then live<br/>To make these woes a tale for distant years:<br/>Oh, what a thought! It gushes to my heart<br/>Like the warm blood.<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Yet both will soon be cold.<br/>Oh, trample out that thought! Worse than despair,<br/>Worse than the bitterness of death, is hope:<br/>It is the only ill which can find place<br/>Upon the giddy, sharp, and narrow hour<br/>Tottering beneath us. Plead with the swift frost<br/>That it should spare the eldest flower of spring:<br/>Plead with awakening earthquake, o'er whose couch<br/>Even now a city stands, strong, fair, and free;<br/>Now stench and blackness yawn, like death. Oh, plead<br/>With famine, or wind-walking Pestilence,<br/>Blind lightning, or the deaf sea, not with man!<br/>Cruel, cold, formal man; righteous in words,<br/>In deeds a Cain. No, Mother, we must die:<br/>Since such is the reward of innocent lives;<br/>Such the alleviation of worst wrongs.<br/>And whilst our murderers live, and hard, cold men,<br/>Smiling and slow, walk through a world of tears<br/>To death as to life's sleep; 'twere just the grave<br/>Were some strange joy for us. Come, obscure Death,<br/>And wind me in thine all-embracing arms!<br/>Like a fond mother hide me in thy bosom,<br/>And rock me to the sleep from which none wake.<br/>Live ye, who live, subject to one another<br/>As we were once, who now...<br/><br/>[BERNARDO RUSHES IN.]<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>Oh, horrible!<br/>That tears, that looks, that hope poured forth in prayer,<br/>Even till the heart is vacant and despairs,<br/>Should all be vain! The ministers of death<br/>Are waiting round the doors. I thought I saw<br/>Blood on the face of one...What if 'twere fancy?<br/>Soon the heart's blood of all I love on earth<br/>Will sprinkle him, and he will wipe it off<br/>As if 'twere only rain. O life! O world!<br/>Cover me! let me be no more! To see<br/>That perfect mirror of pure innocence<br/>Wherein I gazed, and grew happy and good,<br/>Shivered to dust! To see thee, Beatrice,<br/>Who made all lovely thou didst look upon...<br/>Thee, light of life ... dead, dark! while I say, sister,<br/>To hear I have no sister; and thou, Mother,<br/>Whose love was as a bond to all our loves...<br/>Dead! The sweet bond broken!<br/>[ENTER CAMILLO AND GUARDS.]<br/>They come! Let me<br/>Kiss those warm lips before their crimson leaves<br/>Are blighted...white...cold. Say farewell, before<br/>Death chokes that gentle voice! Oh, let me hear<br/>You speak!<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Farewell, my tender brother. Think<br/>Of our sad fate with gentleness, as now:<br/>And let mild, pitying thoughts lighten for thee<br/>Thy sorrow's load. Err not in harsh despair,<br/>But tears and patience. One thing more, my child:<br/>For thine own sake be constant to the love<br/>Thou bearest us; and to the faith that I,<br/>Though wrapped in a strange cloud of crime and shame,<br/>Lived ever holy and unstained. And though<br/>Ill tongues shall wound me, and our common name<br/>Be as a mark stamped on thine innocent brow<br/>For men to point at as they pass, do thou<br/>Forbear, and never think a thought unkind<br/>Of those, who perhaps love thee in their graves.<br/>So mayest thou die as I do; fear and pain<br/>Being subdued. Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!<br/><br/>BERNARDO:<br/>I cannot say, farewell!<br/><br/>CAMILLO:<br/>Oh, Lady Beatrice!<br/><br/>BEATRICE:<br/>Give yourself no unnecessary pain,<br/>My dear Lord Cardinal. Here, Mother, tie<br/>My girdle for me, and bind up this hair<br/>In any simple knot; ay, that does well.<br/>And yours I see is coming down. How often<br/>Have we done this for one another; now<br/>We shall not do it any more. My Lord,<br/>We are quite ready. Well, 'tis very well.
