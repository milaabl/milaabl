  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Stanzas to Augusta by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    When all around grew drear and dark,<br/>  And reason half withheld her ray--<br/>And Hope but shed a dying spark<br/>  Which more misled my lonely way;<br/>In that deep midnight of the mind,<br/>  And that internal strife of heart,<br/>When dreading to be deemed too kind,<br/>  The weak despair--the cold depart;<br/>When Fortune changed--and Love fled far,<br/>  And Hatred's shafts flew thick and fast,<br/>Thou wert the solitary star<br/>  Which rose and set not to the last.<br/>Oh! blest be thine unbroken light!<br/>  That watched me as a Seraph's eye,<br/>And stood between me and the night,<br/>  For ever shining sweetly nigh.<br/>And when the cloud upon us came,<br/>  Which strove to blacken o'er thy ray--<br/>Then purer spread its gentle flame,<br/>  And dashed the darkness all away.<br/>Still may thy Spirit dwell on mine,<br/>  And teach it what to brave or brook--<br/>There's more in one soft word of thine<br/>  Than in the world's defied rebuke.<br/>Thou stood'st, as stands a lovely tree,<br/>  That still unbroke, though gently bent,<br/>Still waves with fond fidelity<br/>  Its boughs above a monument.<br/>The winds might rend--the skies might pour,<br/>  But there thou wert--and still wouldst be<br/>Devoted in the stormiest hour<br/>  To shed thy weeping leaves o'er me.<br/>But thou and thine shall know no blight,<br/>  Whatever fate on me may fall;<br/>For Heaven in sunshine will requite<br/>  The kind--and thee the most of all.<br/>Then let the ties of baffled love<br/>  Be broken--thine will never break;<br/>Thy heart can feel--but will not move;<br/>  Thy soul, though soft, will never shake.<br/>And these, when all was lost beside,<br/>  Were found and still are fixed in thee:--<br/>And bearing still a breast so tried,<br/>  Earth is no desert--ev'n to me.
</p>
