  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Dream Called Life by *Edward Fitzgerald*

<p>
    From the Spanish of Pedro Calderon de la Barca<br/><br/><br/>A dream it was in which I found myself.<br/>And you that hail me now, then hailed me king,<br/>In a brave palace that was all my own,<br/>Within, and all without it, mine; until,<br/>Drunk with excess of majesty and pride,<br/>Methought I towered so big and swelled so wide<br/>That of myself I burst the glittering bubble<br/>Which my ambition had about me blown,<br/>And all again was darkness. Such a dream<br/>As this, in which I may be walking now,<br/>Dispensing solemn justice to you shadows,<br/>Who make believe to listen; but anon<br/>Kings, princes, captains, warriors, plume and steel,<br/>Aye, even with all your airy theatre,<br/>May flit into the air you seem to rend<br/>With acclamations, leaving me to wake<br/>In the dark tower; or dreaming that I wake<br/>From this that waking is; or this and that,<br/>Both waking and both dreaming; such a doubt<br/>Confounds and clouds our moral life about.<br/>But whether wake or dreaming, this I know,<br/>How dreamwise human glories come and go;<br/>Whose momentary tenure not to break,<br/>Walking as one who knows he soon may wake,<br/>So fairly carry the full cup, so well<br/>Disordered insolence and passion quell,<br/>That there be nothing after to upbraid<br/>Dreamer or doer in the part he played;<br/>Whether tomorrow's dawn shall break the spell,<br/>Or the last trumpet of the Eternal Day,<br/>When dreaming, with the night, shall pass away.
</p>
