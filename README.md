# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Canon's Yeoman's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>WHEN ended was the life of Saint Cecile,<br/>Ere we had ridden fully five mile,<br/>At Boughton-under-Blee us gan o'ertake<br/>A man, that clothed was in clothes black,<br/>And underneath he wore a white surplice.<br/>His hackenay, which was all pomely-gris,<br/>So sweated, that it wonder was to see;<br/>It seem'd as he had pricked miles three.<br/>The horse eke that his yeoman rode upon<br/>So sweated, that unnethes might he gon.<br/>About the peytrel  stood the foam full high;<br/>He was of foam, as flecked as a pie.<br/>A maile twyfold  on his crupper lay;<br/>It seemed that he carried little array;<br/>All light for summer rode this worthy man.<br/>And in my heart to wonder I began<br/>What that he was, till that I understood<br/>How that his cloak was sewed to his hood;<br/>For which, when I had long advised me,<br/>I deemed him some Canon for to be.<br/>His hat hung at his back down by a lace,<br/>For he had ridden more than trot or pace;<br/>He hadde pricked like as he were wood.<br/>A clote-leaf he had laid under his hood,<br/>For sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.<br/>But it was joye for to see him sweat;<br/>His forehead dropped as a stillatory<br/>Were full of plantain or of paritory.<br/>And when that he was come, he gan to cry,<br/>"God save," quoth he, "this jolly company.<br/>Fast have I pricked," quoth he, "for your sake,<br/>Because that I would you overtake,<br/>To riden in this merry company."<br/>His Yeoman was eke full of courtesy,<br/>And saide, "Sirs, now in the morning tide<br/>Out of your hostelry I saw you ride,<br/>And warned here my lord and sovereign,<br/>Which that to ride with you is full fain,<br/>For his disport; he loveth dalliance."<br/>"Friend, for thy warning God give thee good chance,"<br/>Said oure Host; "certain it woulde seem<br/>Thy lord were wise, and so I may well deem;<br/>He is full jocund also, dare I lay;<br/>Can he aught tell a merry tale or tway,<br/>With which he gladden may this company?"<br/>"Who, Sir? my lord? Yea, Sir, withoute lie,<br/>He can of mirth and eke of jollity<br/>Not but enough; also, Sir, truste me,<br/>An ye him knew all so well as do I,<br/>Ye would wonder how well and craftily<br/>He coulde work, and that in sundry wise.<br/>He hath take on him many a great emprise,<br/>Which were full hard for any that is here<br/>To bring about, but they of him it lear.<br/>As homely as he rides amonges you,<br/>If ye him knew, it would be for your prow:<br/>Ye woulde not forego his acquaintance<br/>For muche good, I dare lay in balance<br/>All that I have in my possession.<br/>He is a man of high discretion.<br/>I warn you well, he is a passing man."<br/>Well," quoth our Host, "I pray thee tell me than,<br/>Is he a clerk, or no? Tell what he is."<br/>"Nay, he is greater than a clerk, y-wis,"<br/>Saide this Yeoman; "and, in wordes few,<br/>Host, of his craft somewhat I will you shew,<br/>I say, my lord can such a subtlety<br/>(But all his craft ye may not weet of me,<br/>And somewhat help I yet to his working),<br/>That all the ground on which we be riding<br/>Till that we come to Canterbury town,<br/>He could all cleane turnen up so down,<br/>And pave it all of silver and of gold."<br/>And when this Yeoman had this tale told<br/>Unto our Host, he said; "Ben'dicite!<br/>This thing is wonder marvellous to me,<br/>Since that thy lord is of so high prudence,<br/>Because of which men should him reverence,<br/>That of his worship recketh he so lite;<br/>His overest slop it is not worth a mite<br/>As in effect to him, so may I go;<br/>It is all baudy and to-tore also.<br/>Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee pray,<br/>And is of power better clothes to bey,<br/>If that his deed accordeth with thy speech?<br/>Telle me that, and that I thee beseech."<br/><br/>"Why?" quoth this Yeoman, "whereto ask ye me?<br/>God help me so, for he shall never the<br/>(But I will not avowe that I say,<br/>And therefore keep it secret, I you pray);<br/>He is too wise, in faith, as I believe.<br/>Thing that is overdone, it will not preve<br/>Aright, as clerkes say; it is a vice;<br/>Wherefore in that I hold him lewd and nice."<br/>For when a man hath over great a wit,<br/>Full oft him happens to misusen it;<br/>So doth my lord, and that me grieveth sore.<br/>God it amend; I can say now no more."<br/><br/>"Thereof no force, good Yeoman, "quoth our Host;<br/>"Since of the conning of thy lord, thou know'st,<br/>Tell how he doth, I pray thee heartily,<br/>Since that be is so crafty and so sly.<br/>Where dwelle ye, if it to telle be?"<br/>"In the suburbes of a town," quoth he,<br/>"Lurking in hernes and in lanes blind,<br/>Where as these robbers and these thieves by kind<br/>Holde their privy fearful residence,<br/>As they that dare not show their presence,<br/>So fare we, if I shall say the soothe."<br/>"Yet," quoth our Hoste, "let me talke to thee;<br/>Why art thou so discolour'd of thy face?"<br/>"Peter!" quoth he, "God give it harde grace,<br/>I am so us'd the hote fire to blow,<br/>That it hath changed my colour, I trow;<br/>I am not wont in no mirror to pry,<br/>But swinke sore, and learn to multiply.<br/>We blunder ever, and poren in the fire,<br/>And, for all that, we fail of our desire<br/>For ever we lack our conclusion<br/>To muche folk we do illusion,<br/>And borrow gold, be it a pound or two,<br/>Or ten or twelve, or many summes mo',<br/>And make them weenen, at the leaste way,<br/>That of a pounde we can make tway.<br/>Yet is it false; and aye we have good hope<br/>It for to do, and after it we grope:<br/>But that science is so far us beforn,<br/>That we may not, although we had it sworn,<br/>It overtake, it slides away so fast;<br/>It will us make beggars at the last."<br/>While this Yeoman was thus in his talking,<br/>This Canon drew him near, and heard all thing<br/>Which this Yeoman spake, for suspicion<br/>Of menne's speech ever had this Canon:<br/>For Cato saith, that he that guilty is,<br/>Deemeth all things be spoken of him y-wis;<br/>Because of that he gan so nigh to draw<br/>To his Yeoman, that he heard all his saw;<br/>And thus he said unto his Yeoman tho<br/>"Hold thou thy peace,and speak no wordes mo':<br/>For if thou do, thou shalt it dear abie.<br/>Thou slanderest me here in this company<br/>And eke discoverest that thou shouldest hide."<br/>"Yea," quoth our Host, "tell on, whatso betide;<br/>Of all his threatening reck not a mite."<br/>"In faith," quoth he, "no more do I but lite."<br/>And when this Canon saw it would not be<br/>But his Yeoman would tell his privity,<br/>He fled away for very sorrow and shame.<br/><br/>"Ah!" quoth the Yeoman, "here shall rise a game;<br/>All that I can anon I will you tell,<br/>Since he is gone; the foule fiend him quell!<br/>For ne'er hereafter will I with him meet,<br/>For penny nor for pound, I you behete.<br/>He that me broughte first unto that game,<br/>Ere that he die, sorrow have he and shame.<br/>For it is earnest to me, by my faith;<br/>That feel I well, what so any man saith;<br/>And yet for all my smart, and all my grief,<br/>For all my sorrow, labour, and mischief,<br/>I coulde never leave it in no wise.<br/>Now would to God my witte might suffice<br/>To tellen all that longeth to that art!<br/>But natheless yet will I telle part;<br/>Since that my lord is gone, I will not spare;<br/>Such thing as that I know, I will declare."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>With this Canon I dwelt have seven year,<br/>And of his science am I ne'er the near<br/>All that I had I have lost thereby,<br/>And, God wot, so have many more than I.<br/>Where I was wont to be right fresh and gay<br/>Of clothing, and of other good array<br/>Now may I wear an hose upon mine head;<br/>And where my colour was both fresh and red,<br/>Now is it wan, and of a leaden hue<br/>(Whoso it useth, sore shall he it rue);<br/>And of my swink yet bleared is mine eye;<br/>Lo what advantage is to multiply!<br/>That sliding science hath me made so bare,<br/>That I have no good, where that ever I fare;<br/>And yet I am indebted so thereby<br/>Of gold, that I have borrow'd truely,<br/>That, while I live, I shall it quite never;<br/>Let every man beware by me for ever.<br/>What manner man that casteth him thereto,<br/>If he continue, I hold his thrift y-do;<br/>So help me God, thereby shall he not win,<br/>But empty his purse, and make his wittes thin.<br/>And when he, through his madness and folly,<br/>Hath lost his owen good through jupartie,<br/>Then he exciteth other men thereto,<br/>To lose their good as he himself hath do'.<br/>For unto shrewes joy it is and ease<br/>To have their fellows in pain and disease.<br/>Thus was I ones learned of a clerk;<br/>Of that no charge; I will speak of our work.<br/><br/>When we be there as we shall exercise<br/>Our elvish craft, we seeme wonder wise,<br/>Our termes be so clergial and quaint.<br/>I blow the fire till that mine hearte faint.<br/>Why should I tellen each proportion<br/>Of thinges, whiche that we work upon,<br/>As on five or six ounces, may well be,<br/>Of silver, or some other quantity?<br/>And busy me to telle you the names,<br/>As orpiment, burnt bones, iron squames,<br/>That into powder grounden be full small?<br/>And in an earthen pot how put is all,<br/>And, salt y-put in, and also peppere,<br/>Before these powders that I speak of here,<br/>And well y-cover'd with a lamp of glass?<br/>And of much other thing which that there was?<br/>And of the pots and glasses engluting,<br/>That of the air might passen out no thing?<br/>And of the easy fire, and smart also,<br/>Which that was made? and of the care and woe<br/>That we had in our matters subliming,<br/>And in amalgaming, and calcining<br/>Of quicksilver, called mercury crude?<br/>For all our sleightes we can not conclude.<br/>Our orpiment, and sublim'd mercury,<br/>Our ground litharge eke on the porphyry,<br/>Of each of these of ounces a certain,<br/>Not helpeth us, our labour is in vain.<br/>Nor neither our spirits' ascensioun,<br/>Nor our matters that lie all fix'd adown,<br/>May in our working nothing us avail;<br/>For lost is all our labour and travail,<br/>And all the cost, a twenty devil way,<br/>Is lost also, which we upon it lay.<br/><br/>There is also full many another thing<br/>That is unto our craft appertaining,<br/>Though I by order them not rehearse can,<br/>Because that I am a lewed man;<br/>Yet will I tell them as they come to mind,<br/>Although I cannot set them in their kind,<br/>As sal-armoniac, verdigris, borace;<br/>And sundry vessels made of earth and glass;<br/>Our urinales, and our descensories,<br/>Phials, and croslets, and sublimatories,<br/>Cucurbites, and alembikes eke,<br/>And other suche, dear enough a leek,<br/>It needeth not for to rehearse them all.<br/>Waters rubifying, and bulles' gall,<br/>Arsenic, sal-armoniac, and brimstone,<br/>And herbes could I tell eke many a one,<br/>As egremoine, valerian, and lunary,<br/>And other such, if that me list to tarry;<br/>Our lampes burning bothe night and day,<br/>To bring about our craft if that we may;<br/>Our furnace eke of calcination,<br/>And of waters albification,<br/>Unslaked lime, chalk, and glair of an ey,<br/>Powders diverse, ashes, dung, piss, and clay,<br/>Seared pokettes, saltpetre, and vitriol;<br/>And divers fires made of wood and coal;<br/>Sal-tartar, alkali, salt preparate,<br/>And combust matters, and coagulate;<br/>Clay made with horse and manne's hair, and oil<br/>Of tartar, alum, glass, barm, wort, argoil,<br/>Rosalgar, and other matters imbibing;<br/>And eke of our matters encorporing,<br/>And of our silver citrination,<br/>Our cementing, and fermentation,<br/>Our ingots, tests, and many thinges mo'.<br/>I will you tell, as was me taught also,<br/>The foure spirits, and the bodies seven,<br/>By order, as oft I heard my lord them neven.<br/>The first spirit Quicksilver called is;<br/>The second Orpiment; the third, y-wis,<br/>Sal-Armoniac, and the fourth Brimstone.<br/>The bodies sev'n eke, lo them here anon.<br/>Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe<br/>Mars iron, Mercury quicksilver we clepe;<br/>Saturnus lead, and Jupiter is tin,<br/>And Venus copper, by my father's kin.<br/><br/>This cursed craft whoso will exercise,<br/>He shall no good have that him may suffice;<br/>For all the good he spendeth thereabout,<br/>He lose shall, thereof have I no doubt.<br/>Whoso that list to utter his folly,<br/>Let him come forth and learn to multiply:<br/>And every man that hath aught in his coffer,<br/>Let him appear, and wax a philosopher;<br/>Ascaunce that craft is so light to lear.<br/>Nay, nay, God wot, all be he monk or frere,<br/>Priest or canon, or any other wight;<br/>Though he sit at his book both day and night;<br/>In learning of this elvish nice lore,<br/>All is in vain; and pardie muche more,<br/>Is to learn a lew'd man this subtlety;<br/>Fie! speak not thereof, for it will not be.<br/>And conne he letterure, or conne he none,<br/>As in effect, he shall it find all one;<br/>For bothe two, by my salvation,<br/>Concluden in multiplication<br/>Alike well, when they have all y-do;<br/>This is to say, they faile bothe two.<br/>Yet forgot I to make rehearsale<br/>Of waters corrosive, and of limaile,<br/>And of bodies' mollification,<br/>And also of their induration,<br/>Oiles, ablutions, metal fusible,<br/>To tellen all, would passen any Bible<br/>That owhere is; wherefore, as for the best,<br/>Of all these names now will I me rest;<br/>For, as I trow, I have you told enough<br/>To raise a fiend, all look he ne'er so rough.<br/><br/>Ah! nay, let be; the philosopher's stone,<br/>Elixir call'd, we seeke fast each one;<br/>For had we him, then were we sicker enow;<br/>But unto God of heaven I make avow,<br/>For all our craft, when we have all y-do,<br/>And all our sleight, he will not come us to.<br/>He hath y-made us spende muche good,<br/>For sorrow of which almost we waxed wood,<br/>But that good hope creeped in our heart,<br/>Supposing ever, though we sore smart,<br/>To be relieved by him afterward.<br/>Such supposing and hope is sharp and hard.<br/>I warn you well it is to seeken ever.<br/>That future temps hath made men dissever,<br/>In trust thereof, from all that ever they had,<br/>Yet of that art they cannot waxe sad,<br/>For unto them it is a bitter sweet;<br/>So seemeth it; for had they but a sheet<br/>Which that they mighte wrap them in at night,<br/>And a bratt to walk in by dayelight,<br/>They would them sell, and spend it on this craft;<br/>They cannot stint, until no thing be laft.<br/>And evermore, wherever that they gon,<br/>Men may them knowe by smell of brimstone;<br/>For all the world they stinken as a goat;<br/>Their savour is so rammish and so hot,<br/>That though a man a mile from them be,<br/>The savour will infect him, truste me.<br/>Lo, thus by smelling and threadbare array,<br/>If that men list, this folk they knowe may.<br/>And if a man will ask them privily,<br/>Why they be clothed so unthriftily,<br/>They right anon will rownen in his ear,<br/>And sayen, if that they espied were,<br/>Men would them slay, because of their science:<br/>Lo, thus these folk betrayen innocence!<br/><br/>Pass over this; I go my tale unto.<br/>Ere that the pot be on the fire y-do<br/>Of metals, with a certain quantity<br/>My lord them tempers, and no man but he<br/>(Now he is gone, I dare say boldely);<br/>For as men say, he can do craftily,<br/>Algate I wot well he hath such a name,<br/>And yet full oft he runneth into blame;<br/>And know ye how? full oft it happ'neth so,<br/>The pot to-breaks, and farewell! all is go'.<br/>These metals be of so great violence,<br/>Our walles may not make them resistence,<br/>But if they were wrought of lime and stone;<br/>They pierce so, that through the wall they gon;<br/>And some of them sink down into the ground<br/>(Thus have we lost by times many a pound),<br/>And some are scatter'd all the floor about;<br/>Some leap into the roof withoute doubt.<br/>Though that the fiend not in our sight him show,<br/>I trowe that he be with us, that shrew;<br/>In helle, where that he is lord and sire,<br/>Is there no more woe, rancour, nor ire.<br/>When that our pot is broke, as I have said,<br/>Every man chides, and holds him evil apaid.<br/>Some said it was long on the fire-making;<br/>Some saide nay, it was on the blowing<br/>(Then was I fear'd, for that was mine office);<br/>"Straw!" quoth the third, "ye be lewed and nice,<br/>It was not temper'd as it ought to be."<br/>"Nay," quoth the fourthe, "stint and hearken me;<br/>Because our fire was not y-made of beech,<br/>That is the cause, and other none, so the'ch.<br/>I cannot tell whereon it was along,<br/>But well I wot great strife is us among."<br/>"What?" quoth my lord, "there is no more to do'n,<br/>Of these perils I will beware eftsoon.<br/>I am right sicker that the pot was crazed.<br/>Be as be may, be ye no thing amazed.<br/>As usage is, let sweep the floor as swithe;<br/>Pluck up your heartes and be glad and blithe."<br/><br/>The mullok on a heap y-sweeped was,<br/>And on the floor y-cast a canevas,<br/>And all this mullok in a sieve y-throw,<br/>And sifted, and y-picked many a throw.<br/>"Pardie," quoth one, "somewhat of our metal<br/>Yet is there here, though that we have not all.<br/>And though this thing mishapped hath as now,<br/>Another time it may be well enow.<br/>We muste put our good in adventure;<br/>A merchant, pardie, may not aye endure,<br/>Truste me well, in his prosperity:<br/>Sometimes his good is drenched in the sea,<br/>And sometimes comes it safe unto the land."<br/>"Peace," quoth my lord; "the next time I will fand<br/>To bring our craft all in another plight,<br/>And but I do, Sirs, let me have the wite;<br/>There was default in somewhat, well I wot."<br/>Another said, the fire was over hot.<br/>But be it hot or cold, I dare say this,<br/>That we concluden evermore amiss;<br/>We fail alway of that which we would have;<br/>And in our madness evermore we rave.<br/>And when we be together every one,<br/>Every man seemeth a Solomon.<br/>But all thing, which that shineth as the gold,<br/>It is not gold, as I have heard it told;<br/>Nor every apple that is fair at eye,<br/>It is not good, what so men clap or cry.<br/>Right so, lo, fareth it amonges us.<br/>He that the wisest seemeth, by Jesus,<br/>Is most fool, when it cometh to the prefe;<br/>And he that seemeth truest, is a thief.<br/>That shall ye know, ere that I from you wend;<br/>By that I of my tale have made an end.<br/><br/>There was a canon of religioun<br/>Amonges us, would infect all a town,<br/>Though it as great were as was Nineveh,<br/>Rome, Alisandre, Troy, or other three.<br/>His sleightes and his infinite falseness<br/>There coulde no man writen, as I guess,<br/>Though that he mighte live a thousand year;<br/>In all this world of falseness n'is his peer.<br/>For in his termes he will him so wind,<br/>And speak his wordes in so sly a kind,<br/>When he commune shall with any wight,<br/>That he will make him doat anon aright,<br/>But it a fiende be, as himself is.<br/>Full many a man hath he beguil'd ere this,<br/>And will, if that he may live any while;<br/>And yet men go and ride many a mile<br/>Him for to seek, and have his acquaintance,<br/>Not knowing of his false governance.<br/>And if you list to give me audience,<br/>I will it telle here in your presence.<br/>But, worshipful canons religious,<br/>Ne deeme not that I slander your house,<br/>Although that my tale of a canon be.<br/>Of every order some shrew is, pardie;<br/>And God forbid that all a company<br/>Should rue a singular manne's folly.<br/>To slander you is no thing mine intent;<br/>But to correct that is amiss I meant.<br/>This tale was not only told for you,<br/>But eke for other more; ye wot well how<br/>That amonges Christe's apostles twelve<br/>There was no traitor but Judas himselve;<br/>Then why should all the remenant have blame,<br/>That guiltless were? By you I say the same.<br/>Save only this, if ye will hearken me,<br/>If any Judas in your convent be,<br/>Remove him betimes, I you rede,<br/>If shame or loss may causen any dread.<br/>And be no thing displeased, I you pray;<br/>But in this case hearken what I say.<br/><br/>In London was a priest, an annualere,<br/>That therein dwelled hadde many a year,<br/>Which was so pleasant and so serviceable<br/>Unto the wife, where as he was at table,<br/>That she would suffer him no thing to pay<br/>For board nor clothing, went he ne'er so gay;<br/>And spending silver had he right enow;<br/>Thereof no force; will proceed as now,<br/>And telle forth my tale of the canon,<br/>That brought this prieste to confusion.<br/>This false canon came upon a day<br/>Unto the prieste's chamber, where he lay,<br/>Beseeching him to lend him a certain<br/>Of gold, and he would quit it him again.<br/>"Lend me a mark," quoth he, "but dayes three,<br/>And at my day I will it quite thee.<br/>And if it so be that thou find me false,<br/>Another day hang me up by the halse."<br/>This priest him took a mark, and that as swithe,<br/>And this canon him thanked often sithe,<br/>And took his leave, and wente forth his way;<br/>And at the thirde day brought his money;<br/>And to the priest he took his gold again,<br/>Whereof this priest was wondrous glad and fain.<br/>"Certes," quoth he, "nothing annoyeth me<br/>To lend a man a noble, or two, or three,<br/>Or what thing were in my possession,<br/>When he so true is of condition,<br/>That in no wise he breake will his day;<br/>To such a man I never can say nay."<br/>"What," quoth this canon, "should I be untrue?<br/>Nay, that were thing y-fallen all of new!<br/>Truth is a thing that I will ever keep,<br/>Unto the day in which that I shall creep<br/>Into my grave; and elles God forbid;<br/>Believe this as sicker as your creed.<br/>God thank I, and in good time be it said,<br/>That there was never man yet evil apaid<br/>For gold nor silver that he to me lent,<br/>Nor ever falsehood in mine heart I meant.<br/>And Sir," quoth he, "now of my privity,<br/>Since ye so goodly have been unto me,<br/>And kithed to me so great gentleness,<br/>Somewhat, to quite with your kindeness,<br/>I will you shew, and if you list to lear,<br/>I will you teache plainly the mannere<br/>How I can worken in philosophy.<br/>Take good heed, ye shall well see at eye<br/>That I will do a mas'try ere I go."<br/>"Yea," quoth the priest; "yea, Sir, and will ye so?<br/>Mary! thereof I pray you heartily."<br/>"At your commandement, Sir, truely,"<br/>Quoth the canon, "and elles God forbid."<br/>Lo, how this thiefe could his service bede!<br/><br/>Full sooth it is that such proffer'd service<br/>Stinketh, as witnesse these olde wise;<br/>And that full soon I will it verify<br/>In this canon, root of all treachery,<br/>That evermore delight had and gladness<br/>(Such fiendly thoughtes in his heart impress)<br/>How Christe's people he may to mischief bring.<br/>God keep us from his false dissimuling!<br/>What wiste this priest with whom that he dealt?<br/>Nor of his harm coming he nothing felt.<br/>O sely priest, O sely innocent!<br/>With covetise anon thou shalt be blent;<br/>O graceless, full blind is thy conceit!<br/>For nothing art thou ware of the deceit<br/>Which that this fox y-shapen hath to thee;<br/>His wily wrenches thou not mayest flee.<br/>Wherefore, to go to the conclusioun<br/>That referreth to thy confusion,<br/>Unhappy man, anon I will me hie<br/>To telle thine unwit and thy folly,<br/>And eke the falseness of that other wretch,<br/>As farforth as that my conning will stretch.<br/>This canon was my lord, ye woulde ween;<br/>Sir Host, in faith, and by the heaven's queen,<br/>It was another canon, and not he,<br/>That can an hundred fold more subtlety.<br/>He hath betrayed folkes many a time;<br/>Of his falseness it doleth me to rhyme.<br/>And ever, when I speak of his falsehead,<br/>For shame of him my cheekes waxe red;<br/>Algates they beginne for to glow,<br/>For redness have I none, right well I know,<br/>In my visage; for fumes diverse<br/>Of metals, which ye have me heard rehearse,<br/>Consumed have and wasted my redness.<br/>Now take heed of this canon's cursedness.<br/><br/>"Sir," quoth he to the priest, "let your man gon<br/>For quicksilver, that we it had anon;<br/>And let him bringen ounces two or three;<br/>And when he comes, as faste shall ye see<br/>A wondrous thing, which ye saw ne'er ere this."<br/>"Sir," quoth the priest, "it shall be done, y-wis."<br/>He bade his servant fetche him this thing,<br/>And he all ready was at his bidding,<br/>And went him forth, and came anon again<br/>With this quicksilver, shortly for to sayn;<br/>And took these ounces three to the canoun;<br/>And he them laide well and fair adown,<br/>And bade the servant coales for to bring,<br/>That he anon might go to his working.<br/>The coales right anon weren y-fet,<br/>And this canon y-took a crosselet<br/>Out of his bosom, and shew'd to the priest.<br/>"This instrument," quoth he, "which that thou seest,<br/>Take in thine hand, and put thyself therein<br/>Of this quicksilver an ounce, and here begin,<br/>In the name of Christ, to wax a philosopher.<br/>There be full few, which that I woulde proffer<br/>To shewe them thus much of my science;<br/>For here shall ye see by experience<br/>That this quicksilver I will mortify,<br/>Right in your sight anon withoute lie,<br/>And make it as good silver, and as fine,<br/>As there is any in your purse, or mine,<br/>Or elleswhere; and make it malleable,<br/>And elles holde me false and unable<br/>Amonge folk for ever to appear.<br/>I have a powder here that cost me dear,<br/>Shall make all good, for it is cause of all<br/>My conning, which that I you shewe shall.<br/>Voide your man, and let him be thereout;<br/>And shut the doore, while we be about<br/>Our privity, that no man us espy,<br/>While that we work in this phiosophy."<br/>All, as he bade, fulfilled was in deed.<br/>This ilke servant right anon out yede,<br/>And his master y-shut the door anon,<br/>And to their labour speedily they gon.<br/><br/>This priest, at this cursed canon's biddIng,<br/>Upon the fire anon he set this thing,<br/>And blew the fire, and busied him full fast.<br/>And this canon into the croslet cast<br/>A powder, I know not whereof it was<br/>Y-made, either of chalk, either of glass,<br/>Or somewhat elles, was not worth a fly,<br/>To blinden with this priest; and bade him hie<br/>The coales for to couchen all above<br/>The croslet; "for, in token I thee love,"<br/>Quoth this canon, "thine owen handes two<br/>Shall work all thing that here shall be do'."<br/>"Grand mercy," quoth the priest, and was full glad,<br/>And couch'd the coales as the canon bade.<br/>And while he busy was, this fiendly wretch,<br/>This false canon (the foule fiend him fetch),<br/>Out of his bosom took a beechen coal,<br/>In which full subtifly was made a hole,<br/>And therein put was of silver limaile<br/>An ounce, and stopped was withoute fail<br/>The hole with wax, to keep the limaile in.<br/>And understande, that this false gin<br/>Was not made there, but it was made before;<br/>And other thinges I shall tell you more,<br/>Hereafterward, which that he with him brought;<br/>Ere he came there, him to beguile he thought,<br/>And so he did, ere that they went atwin;<br/>Till he had turned him, could he not blin.<br/>It doleth me, when that I of him speak;<br/>On his falsehood fain would I me awreak,<br/>If I wist how, but he is here and there;<br/>He is so variant, he abides nowhere.<br/><br/>But take heed, Sirs, now for Godde's love.<br/>He took his coal, of which I spake above,<br/>And in his hand he bare it privily,<br/>And while the prieste couched busily<br/>The coales, as I tolde you ere this,<br/>This canon saide, "Friend, ye do amiss;<br/>This is not couched as it ought to be,<br/>But soon I shall amenden it," quoth he.<br/>"Now let me meddle therewith but a while,<br/>For of you have I pity, by Saint Gile.<br/>Ye be right hot, I see well how ye sweat;<br/>Have here a cloth, and wipe away the wet."<br/>And while that the prieste wip'd his face,<br/>This canon took his coal, -- with sorry grace, --<br/>And layed it above on the midward<br/>Of the croslet, and blew well afterward,<br/>Till that the coals beganne fast to brenn.<br/>"Now give us drinke," quoth this canon then,<br/>"And swithe all shall be well, I undertake.<br/>Sitte we down, and let us merry make."<br/>And whenne that this canon's beechen coal<br/>Was burnt, all the limaile out of the hole<br/>Into the crosselet anon fell down;<br/>And so it muste needes, by reasoun,<br/>Since it above so even couched was;<br/>But thereof wist the priest no thing, alas!<br/>He deemed all the coals alike good,<br/>For of the sleight he nothing understood.<br/><br/>And when this alchemister saw his time,<br/>"Rise up, Sir Priest," quoth he, "and stand by me;<br/>And, for I wot well ingot have ye none;<br/>Go, walke forth, and bring me a chalk stone;<br/>For I will make it of the same shape<br/>That is an ingot, if I may have hap.<br/>Bring eke with you a bowl, or else a pan,<br/>Full of water, and ye shall well see than<br/>How that our business shall hap and preve<br/>And yet, for ye shall have no misbelieve<br/>Nor wrong conceit of me, in your absence,<br/>I wille not be out of your presence,<br/>But go with you, and come with you again."<br/>The chamber-doore, shortly for to sayn,<br/>They opened and shut, and went their way,<br/>And forth with them they carried the key;<br/>And came again without any delay.<br/>Why should I tarry all the longe day?<br/>He took the chalk, and shap'd it in the wise<br/>Of an ingot, as I shall you devise;<br/>I say, he took out of his owen sleeve<br/>A teine of silver (evil may he cheve!)<br/>Which that ne was but a just ounce of weight.<br/>And take heed now of his cursed sleight;<br/>He shap'd his ingot, in length and in brede<br/>Of this teine, withouten any drede,<br/>So slily, that the priest it not espied;<br/>And in his sleeve again he gan it hide;<br/>And from the fire he took up his mattere,<br/>And in th' ingot put it with merry cheer;<br/>And in the water-vessel he it cast,<br/>When that him list, and bade the priest as fast<br/>Look what there is; "Put in thine hand and grope;<br/>There shalt thou finde silver, as I hope."<br/>What, devil of helle! should it elles be?<br/>Shaving of silver, silver is, pardie.<br/>He put his hand in, and took up a teine<br/>Of silver fine; and glad in every vein<br/>Was this priest, when he saw that it was so.<br/>"Godde's blessing, and his mother's also,<br/>And alle hallows, have ye, Sir Canon!"<br/>Saide this priest, "and I their malison<br/>But, an' ye vouchesafe to teache me<br/>This noble craft and this subtility,<br/>I will be yours in all that ever I may."<br/>Quoth the canon, "Yet will I make assay<br/>The second time, that ye may take heed,<br/>And be expert of this, and, in your need,<br/>Another day assay in mine absence<br/>This discipline, and this crafty science.<br/>Let take another ounce," quoth he tho,<br/>"Of quicksilver, withoute wordes mo',<br/>And do therewith as ye have done ere this<br/>With that other, which that now silver is. "<br/><br/>The priest him busied, all that e'er he can,<br/>To do as this canon, this cursed man,<br/>Commanded him, and fast he blew the fire<br/>For to come to th' effect of his desire.<br/>And this canon right in the meanewhile<br/>All ready was this priest eft to beguile,<br/>and, for a countenance, in his hande bare<br/>An hollow sticke (take keep and beware);<br/>Of silver limaile put was, as before<br/>Was in his coal, and stopped with wax well<br/>For to keep in his limaile every deal.<br/>And while this priest was in his business,<br/>This canon with his sticke gan him dress<br/>To him anon, and his powder cast in,<br/>As he did erst (the devil out of his skin<br/>Him turn, I pray to God, for his falsehead,<br/>For he was ever false in thought and deed),<br/>And with his stick, above the crosselet,<br/>That was ordained with that false get,<br/>He stirr'd the coales, till relente gan<br/>The wax against the fire, as every man,<br/>But he a fool be, knows well it must need.<br/>And all that in the sticke was out yede,<br/>And in the croslet hastily it fell.<br/>Now, goode Sirs, what will ye bet than well?<br/>When that this priest was thus beguil'd again,<br/>Supposing naught but truthe, sooth to sayn,<br/>He was so glad, that I can not express<br/>In no mannere his mirth and his gladness;<br/>And to the canon he proffer'd eftsoon<br/>Body and good. "Yea," quoth the canon soon,<br/>"Though poor I be, crafty thou shalt me find;<br/>I warn thee well, yet is there more behind.<br/>Is any copper here within?" said he.<br/>"Yea, Sir," the prieste said, "I trow there be."<br/>"Elles go buy us some, and that as swithe.<br/>Now, goode Sir, go forth thy way and hie thee."<br/>He went his way, and with the copper came,<br/>And this canon it in his handes name,<br/>And of that copper weighed out an ounce.<br/>Too simple is my tongue to pronounce,<br/>As minister of my wit, the doubleness<br/>Of this canon, root of all cursedness.<br/>He friendly seem'd to them that knew him not;<br/>But he was fiendly, both in work and thought.<br/>It wearieth me to tell of his falseness;<br/>And natheless yet will I it express,<br/>To that intent men may beware thereby,<br/>And for none other cause truely.<br/>He put this copper in the crosselet,<br/>And on the fire as swithe he hath it set,<br/>And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,<br/>And in his working for to stoope low,<br/>As he did erst, and all was but a jape;<br/>Right as him list the priest he made his ape.<br/>And afterward in the ingot he it cast,<br/>And in the pan he put it at the last<br/>Of water, and in he put his own hand;<br/>And in his sleeve, as ye beforehand<br/>Hearde me tell, he had a silver teine;<br/>He silly took it out, this cursed heine<br/>(Unweeting this priest of his false craft),<br/>And in the panne's bottom he it laft<br/>And in the water rumbleth to and fro,<br/>And wondrous privily took up also<br/>The copper teine (not knowing thilke priest),<br/>And hid it, and him hente by the breast,<br/>And to him spake, and thus said in his game;<br/>"Stoop now adown; by God, ye be to blame;<br/>Helpe me now, as I did you whilere;<br/>Put in your hand, and looke what is there."<br/><br/>This priest took up this silver teine anon;<br/>And thenne said the canon, "Let us gon,<br/>With these three teines which that we have wrought,<br/>To some goldsmith, and weet if they be aught:<br/>For, by my faith, I would not for my hood<br/>But if they were silver fine and good,<br/>And that as swithe well proved shall it be."<br/>Unto the goldsmith with these teines three<br/>They went anon, and put them in assay<br/>To fire and hammer; might no man say nay,<br/>But that they weren as they ought to be.<br/>This sotted priest, who gladder was than he?<br/>Was never bird gladder against the day;<br/>Nor nightingale in the season of May<br/>Was never none, that better list to sing;<br/>Nor lady lustier in carolling,<br/>Or for to speak of love and womanhead;<br/>Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed,<br/>To standen in grace of his lady dear,<br/>Than had this priest this crafte for to lear;<br/>And to the canon thus he spake and said;<br/>"For love of God, that for us alle died,<br/>And as I may deserve it unto you,<br/>What shall this receipt coste? tell me now."<br/>"By our Lady," quoth this canon, "it is dear.<br/>I warn you well, that, save I and a frere,<br/>In Engleland there can no man it make."<br/>"No force," quoth he; "now, Sir, for Godde's sake,<br/>What shall I pay? telle me, I you pray."<br/>"Y-wis," quoth he, "it is full dear, I say.<br/>Sir, at one word, if that you list it have,<br/>Ye shall pay forty pound, so God me save;<br/>And n'ere the friendship that ye did ere this<br/>To me, ye shoulde paye more, y-wis."<br/>This priest the sum of forty pound anon<br/>Of nobles fet, and took them every one<br/>To this canon, for this ilke receipt.<br/>All his working was but fraud and deceit.<br/>"Sir Priest," he said, "I keep to have no los<br/>Of my craft, for I would it were kept close;<br/>And as ye love me, keep it secre:<br/>For if men knewen all my subtlety,<br/>By God, they woulde have so great envy<br/>To me, because of my philosophy,<br/>I should be dead, there were no other way."<br/>"God it forbid," quoth the priest, "what ye say.<br/>Yet had I lever spenden all the good<br/>Which that I have (and elles were I wood),<br/>Than that ye shoulde fall in such mischief."<br/>"For your good will, Sir, have ye right good prefe,"<br/>Quoth the canon; "and farewell, grand mercy."<br/>He went his way, and never the priest him sey<br/>After that day; and when that this priest should<br/>Maken assay, at such time as he would,<br/>Of this receipt, farewell! it would not be.<br/>Lo, thus bejaped and beguil'd was he;<br/>Thus made he his introduction<br/>To bringe folk to their destruction.<br/><br/>Consider, Sirs, how that in each estate<br/>Betwixte men and gold there is debate,<br/>So farforth that unnethes is there none.<br/>This multiplying blint so many a one,<br/>That in good faith I trowe that it be<br/>The cause greatest of such scarcity.<br/>These philosophers speak so mistily<br/>In this craft, that men cannot come thereby,<br/>For any wit that men have how-a-days.<br/>They may well chatter, as do these jays,<br/>And in their termes set their lust and pain,<br/>But to their purpose shall they ne'er attain.<br/>A man may lightly learn, if he have aught,<br/>To multiply, and bring his good to naught.<br/>Lo, such a lucre is in this lusty game;<br/>A manne's mirth it will turn all to grame,<br/>And empty also great and heavy purses,<br/>And make folke for to purchase curses<br/>Of them that have thereto their good y-lent.<br/>Oh, fy for shame! they that have been brent,<br/>Alas! can they not flee the fire's heat?<br/>Ye that it use, I rede that ye it lete,<br/>Lest ye lose all; for better than never is late;<br/>Never to thrive, were too long a date.<br/>Though ye prowl aye, ye shall it never find;<br/>Ye be as bold as is Bayard the blind,<br/>That blunders forth, and peril casteth none;<br/>He is as bold to run against a stone,<br/>As for to go beside it in the way:<br/>So fare ye that multiply, I say.<br/>If that your eyen cannot see aright,<br/>Look that your minde lacke not his sight.<br/>For though you look never so broad, and stare,<br/>Ye shall not win a mite on that chaffare,<br/>But wasten all that ye may rape and renn.<br/>Withdraw the fire, lest it too faste brenn;<br/>Meddle no more with that art, I mean;<br/>For if ye do, your thrift is gone full clean.<br/>And right as swithe I will you telle here<br/>What philosophers say in this mattere.<br/><br/>Lo, thus saith Arnold of the newe town,<br/>As his Rosary maketh mentioun,<br/>He saith right thus, withouten any lie;<br/>"There may no man mercury mortify,<br/>But it be with his brother's knowledging."<br/>Lo, how that he, which firste said this thing,<br/>Of philosophers father was, Hermes;<br/>He saith, how that the dragon doubteless<br/>He dieth not, but if that he be slain<br/>With his brother. And this is for to sayn,<br/>By the dragon, Mercury, and none other,<br/>He understood, and Brimstone by his brother,<br/>That out of Sol and Luna were y-draw.<br/>"And therefore," said he, "take heed to my saw.<br/>Let no man busy him this art to seech,<br/>But if that he th'intention and speech<br/>Of philosophers understande can;<br/>And if he do, he is a lewed man.<br/>For this science and this conning," quoth he,<br/>"Is of the secret of secrets  pardie."<br/>Also there was a disciple of Plato,<br/>That on a time said his master to,<br/>As his book, Senior,  will bear witness,<br/>And this was his demand in soothfastness:<br/>"Tell me the name of thilke privy stone."<br/>And Plato answer'd unto him anon;<br/>"Take the stone that Titanos men name."<br/>"Which is that?" quoth he. "Magnesia is the same,"<br/>Saide Plato. "Yea, Sir, and is it thus?<br/>This is ignotum per ignotius.<br/>What is Magnesia, good Sir, I pray?"<br/>"It is a water that is made, I say,<br/>Of th' elementes foure," quoth Plato.<br/>"Tell me the roote, good Sir," quoth he tho,<br/>"Of that water, if that it be your will."<br/>"Nay, nay," quoth Plato, "certain that I n'ill.<br/>The philosophers sworn were every one,<br/>That they should not discover it to none,<br/>Nor in no book it write in no mannere;<br/>For unto God it is so lefe and dear,<br/>That he will not that it discover'd be,<br/>But where it liketh to his deity<br/>Man for to inspire, and eke for to defend'<br/>Whom that he liketh; lo, this is the end."<br/><br/>Then thus conclude I, since that God of heaven<br/>Will not that these philosophers neven<br/>How that a man shall come unto this stone,<br/>I rede as for the best to let it gon.<br/>For whoso maketh God his adversary,<br/>As for to work any thing in contrary<br/>Of his will, certes never shall he thrive,<br/>Though that he multiply term of his live.<br/>And there a point; for ended is my tale.<br/>God send ev'ry good man boot of his bale.
