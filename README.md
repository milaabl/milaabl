# üíÆ Epistle to Miss Blount, With the Works of Voiture. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    In these gay thoughts the Loves and Graces shine,<br/>And all the writer lives in every line;<br/>His easy art may happy nature seem,<br/>Trifles themselves are elegant in him.<br/>Sure, to charm all was his peculiar fate,<br/>Who without flattery pleased the fair and great;<br/>Still with esteem no less conversed than read;<br/>With wit well-natured, and with books well-bred:<br/>His heart, his mistress, and his friend did share,<br/>His time, the Muse, the witty, and the fair.<br/>Thus wisely careless, innocently gay,<br/>Cheerful he play'd the trifle, Life, away;<br/>Till Fate scarce felt his gentle breath suppress'd,<br/>As smiling infants sport themselves to rest.<br/>Even rival wits did Voiture's death deplore,<br/>And the gay mourn'd who never mourn'd before;<br/>The truest hearts for Voiture heaved with sighs,<br/>Voiture was wept by all the brightest eyes:<br/>The Smiles and Loves had died in Voiture's death,<br/>But that for ever in his lines they breathe.<br/><br/>Let the strict life of graver mortals be<br/>A long, exact, and serious comedy;<br/>In every scene some moral let it teach,<br/>And if it can, at once both please and preach.<br/>Let mine an innocent gay farce appear,<br/>And more diverting still than regular,<br/>Have humour, wit, a native ease and grace,<br/>Though not too strictly bound to time and place:<br/>Critics in wit, or life, are hard to please,<br/>Few write to those, and none can live to these.<br/><br/>Too much your sex is by their forms confined,<br/>Severe to all, but most to womankind;<br/>Custom, grown blind with age, must be your guide;<br/>Your pleasure is a vice, but not your pride;<br/>By nature yielding, stubborn but for fame;<br/>Made slaves by honour, and made fools by shame.<br/>Marriage may all those petty tyrants chase,<br/>But sets up one, a greater, in their place;<br/>Well might you wish for change, by those accursed,<br/>But the last tyrant ever proves the worst.<br/>Still in constraint your suffering sex remains,<br/>Or bound in formal, or in real chains:<br/>Whole years neglected, for some months adored,<br/>The fawning servant turns a haughty lord.<br/>Ah, quit not the free innocence of life,<br/>For the dull glory of a virtuous wife;<br/>Nor let false shows, or empty titles please:<br/>Aim not at joy, but rest content with ease!<br/><br/>The gods, to curse Pamela with her prayers,<br/>Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares,<br/>The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state,<br/>And, to complete her bliss, a fool for mate.<br/>She glares in balls, front boxes, and the Ring,<br/>A vain, unquiet, glittering, wretched thing!<br/>Pride, pomp, and state but reach her outward part:<br/>She sighs, and is no duchess at her heart.<br/><br/>But, madam, if the Fates withstand, and you<br/>Are destined Hymen's willing victim too:<br/>Trust not too much your now resistless charms,<br/>Those, age or sickness, soon or late, disarms:<br/>Good-humour only teaches charms to last,<br/>Still makes new conquests, and maintains the past;<br/>Love, raised on beauty, will like that decay,<br/>Our hearts may bear its slender chain a day;<br/>As flowery bands in wantonness are worn,<br/>A morning's pleasure, and at evening torn;<br/>This binds in ties more easy, yet more strong,<br/>The willing heart, and only holds it long.<br/><br/>Thus Voiture's early care still shone the same,<br/>And Monthansier was only changed in name:<br/>By this, even now they live, even now they charm,<br/>Their wit still sparkling, and their flames still warm.<br/><br/>Now crown'd with myrtle, on the Elysian coast,<br/>Amid those lovers, joys his gentle ghost:<br/>Pleased, while with smiles his happy lines you view,<br/>And finds a fairer Rambouillet in you.<br/>The brightest eyes of France inspired his Muse;<br/>The brightest eyes of Britain now peruse;<br/>And dead, as living, 'tis our author's pride<br/>Still to charm those who charm the world beside.
