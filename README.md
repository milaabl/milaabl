  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Madam Life's a Piece in Bloom by *William Ernest Henley*

<p>
    Madam Life's a piece in bloom<br/>Death goes dogging everywhere:<br/>She's the tenant of the room,<br/>He's the ruffian on the stair.<br/><br/>You shall see her as a friend,<br/>You shall bilk him once or twice;<br/>But he'll trap you in the end,<br/>And he'll stick you for her price.<br/><br/>With his kneebones at your chest,<br/>And his knuckles in your throat,<br/>You would reason -- plead -- protest!<br/>Clutching at her petticoat;<br/><br/>But she's heard it all before,<br/>Well she knows you've had your fun,<br/>Gingerly she gains the door,<br/>And your little job is done.
</p>
