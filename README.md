<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Faith by *George Herbert*

<p>
    Lord, how couldst thou so much appease<br/>Thy wrath for sin, as when man's sight was dim,<br/>And could see little, to regard his ease,<br/>And bring by Faith all things to him?<br/><br/>Hungry I was, and had no meat:<br/>I did conceit a most delicious feast;<br/>I had it straight, and did as truly eat,<br/>As ever did a welcome guest.<br/><br/>There is a rare outlandish root,<br/>Which when I could not get, I thought it here:<br/>That apprehension cur'd so well my foot,<br/>That I can walk to heav'n well near.<br/><br/>I owed thousands and much more.<br/>I did believe that I did nothing owe,<br/>And liv'd accordingly; my creditor<br/>Believes so too, and lets me go.<br/><br/>Faith makes me any thing, or all<br/>That I believe is in the sacred story:<br/>And where sin placeth me in Adam's fall,<br/>Faith sets me higher in his glory.<br/><br/>If I go lower in the book,<br/>What can be lower than the common manger?<br/>Faith puts me there with him, who sweetly took<br/>Our flesh and frailty, death and danger.<br/><br/>If bliss had lien in art or strength,<br/>None but the wise or strong had gained it:<br/>Where now by Faith all arms are of a length;<br/>One size doth all conditions fit.<br/><br/>A peasant may believe as much<br/>As a great Clerk, and reach the highest stature.<br/>Thus dost thou make proud knowledge bend and crouch<br/>While grace fills up uneven nature.<br/><br/>When creatures had no real light<br/>Inherent in them, thou didst make the sun<br/>Impute a lustre, and allow them bright;<br/>And in this show what Christ hath done.<br/><br/>That which before was darkned clean<br/>With bushy groves, pricking the looker's eye,<br/>Vanisht away, when Faith did change the scene:<br/>And then appear'd a glorious sky.<br/><br/>What though my body run to dust?<br/>Faith cleaves unto it, counting ev'ry grain<br/>With an exact and most particular trust,<br/>Reserving all for flesh again.
</p>
