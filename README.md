# üíÆ The Passion by *John Milton*

<p>
    I<br/><br/>Ere-while of Musick, and Ethereal mirth,<br/>Wherwith the stage of Ayr and Earth did ring,<br/>And joyous news of heav'nly Infants birth,<br/>My muse with Angels did divide to sing;<br/>But headlong joy is ever on the wing,<br/>In Wintry solstice like the shortn'd light<br/>Soon swallow'd up in dark and long out-living night.<br/><br/>II<br/><br/>For now to sorrow must I tune my song,<br/>And set my Harpe to notes of saddest wo,<br/>Which on our dearest Lord did sease er'e long,<br/>Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse then so,<br/>Which he for us did freely undergo.<br/>Most perfect Heroe, try'd in heaviest plight<br/>Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight.<br/><br/>III<br/><br/>He sov'ran Priest stooping his regall head<br/>That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,<br/>Poor fleshly Tabernacle entered,<br/>His starry front low-rooft beneath the skies;<br/>O what a Mask was there, what a disguise!<br/>Yet more; the stroke of death he must abide,<br/>Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethrens side.<br/><br/>IV<br/><br/>These latter scenes confine my roving vers,<br/>To this Horizon is my Phoebus bound,<br/>His Godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,<br/>And former sufferings other where are found;<br/>Loud o're the rest Cremona's Trump doth sound;<br/>Me softer airs befit, and softer strings<br/>Of Lute, or Viol still, more apt for mournful things.<br/><br/>Note: 22 latter] latest 1673.<br/><br/>V<br/><br/>Befriend me night best Patroness of grief,<br/>Over the Pole thy thickest mantle throw,<br/>And work my flatterd fancy to belief,<br/>That Heav'n and Earth are colour'd with my wo;<br/>My sorrows are too dark for day to know:<br/>The leaves should all be black wheron I write,<br/>And letters where my tears have washt a wannish white.<br/><br/>VI<br/><br/>See see the Chariot, and those rushing wheels,<br/>That whirl'd the Prophet up at Chebar flood,<br/>My spirit som transporting Cherub feels,<br/>To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,<br/>Once glorious Towers, now sunk in guiltles blood;<br/>There doth my soul in holy vision sit<br/>In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatick fit.<br/><br/>VII<br/><br/>Mine eye hath found that sad Sepulchral rock<br/>That was the Casket of Heav'ns richest store,<br/>And here though grief my feeble hands up-lock,<br/>Yet on the softned Quarry would I score<br/>My plaining vers as lively as before;<br/>For sure so well instructed are my tears,<br/>They would fitly fall in order'd Characters.<br/><br/>VIII<br/><br/>I thence hurried on viewles wing,<br/>Take up a weeping on the Mountains wilde,<br/>The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring<br/>Would soon unboosom all their Echoes milde,<br/>And I (for grief is easily beguild)<br/>Might think th'infection of my sorrows bound,<br/>Had got a race of mourners on som pregnant cloud.<br/><br/>Note: This subject the Author finding to be above the yeers he had,<br/>when he wrote it, and nothing satisfi'd with what was begun,<br/>left it unfinish'd.
