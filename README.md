  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To Florence by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Oh Lady! when I left the shore,<br/>  The distant shore which gave me birth,<br/>I hardly thought to grieve once more,<br/>  To quit another spot on earth:<br/><br/>Yet here, amidst this barren isle,<br/>  Where panting Nature droops the head,<br/>Where only thou art seen to smile,<br/>  I view my parting hour with dread.<br/><br/>Though far from Albin's craggy shore,<br/>  Divided by the dark-blue main;<br/>A few, brief, rolling seasons o'er,<br/>  Perchance I view her cliffs again:<br/><br/>But wheresoe'er I now may roam,<br/>  Through scorching clime, and varied sea,<br/>Though Time restore me to my home,<br/>  I ne'er shall bend mine eyes on thee:<br/><br/>On thee, in whom at once conspire<br/>  All charms which heedless hearts can move,<br/>Whom but to see is to admire,<br/>  And, oh! forgive the word--to love.<br/><br/>Forgive the word, in one who ne'er<br/>  With such a word can more offend;<br/>And since thy heart I cannot share,<br/>  Believe me, what I am, thy friend.<br/><br/>And who so cold as look on thee,<br/>  Thou lovely wand'rer, and be less?<br/>Nor be, what man should ever be,<br/>  The friend of Beauty in distress?<br/><br/>Ah! who would think that form had past<br/>  Through Danger's most destructive path,<br/>Had braved the death-winged tempest's blast,<br/>  And 'scaped a Tyrant's fiercer wrath?<br/><br/>Lady! when I shall view the walls<br/>  Where free Byzantium once arose,<br/>And Stamboul's Oriental halls<br/>  The Turkish tyrants now enclose;<br/><br/>Though mightiest in the lists of fame,<br/>  That glorious city still shall be;<br/>On me 'twill hold a dearer claim,<br/>  As spot of thy nativity:<br/><br/>And though I bid thee now farewell,<br/>  When I behold that wondrous scene--<br/>Since where thou art I may not dwell--<br/>  'Twill soothe to be where thou hast been.
</p>
