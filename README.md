# üíÆ Fare Thee Well by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
           "Alas! they had been friends in youth;<br/>       But whispering tongues can poison truth:<br/>       And Constancy lives in realms above;<br/>       And Life is thorny; and youth is vain:<br/>       And to be wroth with one we love,<br/>       Doth work like madness in the brain;<br/><br/>       But never either found another<br/>       To free the hollow heart from paining--<br/>       They stood aloof, the scars remaining,<br/>       Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;<br/>       A dreary sea now flows between,<br/>       But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,<br/>       Shall wholly do away, I ween,<br/>       The marks of that which once hath been."<br/>              Coleridge's Christabel.<br/><br/>Fare thee well! and if for ever,<br/>  Still for ever, fare _thee well:_<br/>Even though unforgiving, never<br/>  'Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.<br/>Would that breast were bared before thee<br/>  Where thy head so oft hath lain,<br/>While that placid sleep came o'er thee<br/>  Which thou ne'er canst know again:<br/>Would that breast, by thee glanced over,<br/>  Every inmost thought could show!<br/>Then thou would'st at last discover<br/>  'Twas not well to spurn it so.<br/>Though the world for this commend thee--<br/>  Though it smile upon the blow,<br/>Even its praises must offend thee,<br/>  Founded on another's woe:<br/>Though my many faults defaced me,<br/>  Could no other arm be found,<br/>Than the one which once embraced me,<br/>  To inflict a cureless wound?<br/>Yet, oh yet, thyself deceive not--<br/>  Love may sink by slow decay,<br/>But by sudden wrench, believe not<br/>  Hearts can thus be torn away:<br/>Still thine own its life retaineth--<br/>  Still must mine, though bleeding, beat;<br/>And the undying thought which paineth<br/>  Is--that we no more may meet.<br/>These are words of deeper sorrow<br/>  Than the wail above the dead;<br/>Both shall live--but every morrow<br/>  Wake us from a widowed bed.<br/>And when thou would'st solace gather--<br/>  When our child's first accents flow--<br/>Wilt thou teach her to say "Father!"<br/>  Though his care she must forego?<br/>When her little hands shall press thee--<br/>  When her lip to thine is pressed--<br/>Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee--<br/>  Think of him thy love _had_ blessed!<br/>Should her lineaments resemble<br/>  Those thou never more may'st see,<br/>Then thy heart will softly tremble<br/>  With a pulse yet true to me.<br/>All my faults perchance thou knowest--<br/>  All my madness--none can know;<br/>All my hopes--where'er thou goest--<br/>  Wither--yet with _thee_ they go.<br/>Every feeling hath been shaken;<br/>  Pride--which not a world could bow--<br/>Bows to thee--by thee forsaken,<br/>  Even my soul forsakes me now.<br/>But 'tis done--all words are idle--<br/>  Words from me are vainer still;<br/>But the thoughts we cannot bridle<br/>  Force their way without the will.<br/>Fare thee well! thus disunited--<br/>  Torn from every nearer tie--<br/>Seared in heart--and lone--and blighted--<br/>  More than this I scarce can die.
</p>
