  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ October by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    THE green elm with the one great bough of gold<br/>Lets leaves into the grass slip, one by one,--<br/>The short hill grass, the mushrooms small milk-white,<br/>Harebell and scabious and tormentil,<br/>That blackberry and gorse, in dew and sun,<br/>Bow down to; and the wind travels too light<br/>To shake the fallen birch leaves from the fern;<br/>The gossamers wander at their own will.<br/>At heavier steps than birds' the squirrels scold.<br/><br/>The rich scene has grown fresh again and new<br/>As Spring and to the touch is not more cool<br/>Than it is warm to the gaze; and now I might<br/>As happy be as earth is beautiful,<br/>Were I some other or with earth could turn<br/>In alternation of violet and rose,<br/>Harebell and snowdrop, at their season due,<br/>And gorse that has no time not to be gay.<br/>But if this be not happiness,--who knows?<br/>Some day I shall think this a happy day,<br/>And this mood by the name of melancholy<br/>Shall no more blackened and obscured be.
</p>
