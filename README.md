# üíÆ The Sailor-Boy by *John Clare*

<p>
    Tis three years and a quarter since I left my own fireside<br/>To go aboard a ship through love, and plough the ocean wide.<br/>I crossed my native fields, where the scarlet poppies grew,<br/>And the groundlark left his nest like a neighbour which I knew.<br/><br/>The pigeons from the dove cote cooed over the old lane,<br/>The crow flocks from the oakwood went flopping oer the grain;<br/>Like lots of dear old neighbours whom I shall see no more<br/>They greeted me that morning I left the English shore.<br/><br/>The sun was just a-rising above the heath of furze,<br/>And the shadows grow to giants; that bright ball never stirs:<br/>There the shepherds lay with their dogs by their side,<br/>And they started up and barked as my shadow they espied.<br/><br/>A maid of early morning twirled her mop upon the moor;<br/>I wished her my farewell before she closed the door.<br/>My friends I left behind me for other places new,<br/>Crows and pigeons all were strangers as oer my head they flew.<br/><br/>Trees and bushes were all strangers, the hedges and the lanes,<br/>The steeples and the houses and broad untrodden plains.<br/>I passed the pretty milkmaid with her red and rosy face;<br/>I knew not where I met her, I was strange to the place.<br/><br/>At last I saw the ocean, a pleasing sight to me:<br/>I stood upon the shore of a mighty glorious sea.<br/>The waves in easy motion went rolling on their way,<br/>English colours were a-flying where the British squadron lay.<br/><br/>I left my honest parents, the church clock and the village;<br/>I left the lads and lasses, the labour and the tillage;<br/>To plough the briny ocean, which soon became my joy--<br/>I sat and sang among the shrouds, a lonely sailor-boy.
