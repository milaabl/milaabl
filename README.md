  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Mesmerism by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    All I believed is true!<br/>        I am able yet<br/>        All I want, to get<br/>By a method as strange as new:<br/>Dare I trust the same to you?<br/><br/>If at night, when doors are shut,<br/>        And the wood-worm picks,<br/>        And the death-watch ticks,<br/>And the bar has a flag of smut,<br/>And a cat's in the water-butt--<br/><br/>And the socket floats and flares,<br/>        And the house-beams groan,<br/>        And a foot unknown<br/>Is surmised on the garret-stairs,<br/>And the locks slip unawares--<br/><br/>And the spider, to serve his ends,<br/>        By a sudden thread,<br/>        Arms and legs outspread,<br/>On the table's midst descends,<br/>Comes to find, God knows what friends!--<br/><br/>If since eve drew in, I say,<br/>        I have sat and brought<br/>        (So to speak) my thought<br/>To bear on the woman away,<br/>Till I felt my hair turn grey--<br/><br/>Till I seemed to have and hold,<br/>        In the vacancy<br/>        'Twixt the wall and me,<br/>From the hair-plait's chestnut gold<br/>To the foot in its muslin fold--<br/><br/>Have and hold, then and there,<br/>        Her, from head to foot<br/>        Breathing and mute,<br/>Passive and yet aware,<br/>In the grasp of my steady stare--<br/><br/>Hold and have, there and then,<br/>        All her body and soul<br/>        That completes my whole,<br/>All that women add to men,<br/>In the clutch of my steady ken--<br/><br/>Having and holding, till<br/>        I imprint her fast<br/>        On the void at last<br/>As the sun does whom he will<br/>By the calotypist's skill--<br/><br/>Then,--if my heart's strength serve,<br/>        And through all and each<br/>        Of the veils I reach<br/>To her soul and never swerve,<br/>Knitting an iron nerve--<br/><br/>Command her soul to advance<br/>        And inform the shape<br/>        Which has made escape<br/>And before my countenance<br/>Answers me glance for glance--<br/><br/>I, still with a gesture fit<br/>        Of my hands that best<br/>        Do my soul's behest,<br/>Pointing the power from it,<br/>While myself do steadfast sit--<br/><br/>Steadfast and still the same<br/>        On my object bent,<br/>        While the hands give vent<br/>To my ardour and my aim<br/>And break into very flame--<br/><br/>Then I reach, I must believe,<br/>        Not her soul in vain,<br/>        For to me again<br/>It reaches, and past retrieve<br/>Is wound in the toils I weave;<br/><br/>And must follow as I require,<br/>        As befits a thrall,<br/>        Bringing flesh and all,<br/>Essence and earth-attire<br/>To the source of the tractile fire:<br/><br/>Till the house called hers, not mine,<br/>        With a growing weight<br/>        Seems to suffocate<br/>If she break not its leaden line<br/>And escape from its close confine.<br/><br/>Out of doors into the night!<br/>        On to the maze<br/>        Of the wild wood-ways,<br/>Not turning to left nor right<br/>From the pathway, blind with sight--<br/><br/>Making thro' rain and wind<br/>        O'er the broken shrubs,<br/>        'Twixt the stems and stubs,<br/>With a still, composed, strong mind,<br/>Nor a care for the world behind--<br/><br/>Swifter and still more swift,<br/>        As the crowding peace<br/>        Doth to joy increase<br/>In the wide blind eyes uplift<br/>Thro' the darkness and the drift!<br/><br/>While I--to the shape, I too<br/>        Feel my soul dilate<br/>        Nor a whit abate,<br/>And relax not a gesture due,<br/>As I see my belief come true.<br/><br/>For, there! have I drawn or no<br/>        Life to that lip?<br/>        Do my fingers dip<br/>In a flame which again they throw<br/>On the cheek that breaks a-glow?<br/><br/>Ha! was the hair so first?<br/>        What, unfilleted,<br/>        Made alive, and spread<br/>Through the void with a rich outburst,<br/>Chestnut gold-interspersed?<br/><br/>Like the doors of a casket-shrine,<br/>        See, on either side,<br/>        Her two arms divide<br/>Till the heart betwixt makes sign,<br/>Take me, for I am thine!<br/><br/>"Now--now"--the door is heard!<br/>        Hark, the stairs! and near--<br/>        Nearer--and here--<br/>"Now!" and at call the third<br/>She enters without a word.<br/><br/>On doth she march and on<br/>        To the fancied shape;<br/>        It is, past escape,<br/>Herself, now: the dream is done<br/>And the shadow and she are one.<br/><br/>First I will pray. Do Thou<br/>        That ownest the soul,<br/>        Yet wilt grant control<br/>To another, nor disallow<br/>For a time, restrain me now!<br/><br/>I admonish me while I may,<br/>        Not to squander guilt,<br/>        Since require Thou wilt<br/>At my hand its price one day!<br/>What the price is, who can say?
