# 💮 To A Friend Who Sent Me Some Roses by *John Keats*

<p>
    As late I rambled in the happy fields,<br/>What time the skylark shakes the tremulous dew<br/>From his lush clover covert;—when anew<br/>Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields;<br/>I saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields,<br/>A fresh-blown musk-rose; 'twas the first that threw<br/>Its sweets upon the summer: graceful it grew<br/>As is the wand that Queen Titania wields.<br/>And, as I feasted on its fragrancy,<br/>I thought the garden-rose it far excelled;<br/>But when, O Wells! thy roses came to me,<br/>My sense with their deliciousness was spelled:<br/>Soft voices had they, that with tender plea<br/>Whispered of peace, and truth, and friendliness unquelled.
</p>
