# üíÆ Epithalamion by *Edmund Spenser*

<p>
    YE learned sisters, which have oftentimes<br/>Beene to me ayding, others to adorne,<br/>Whom ye thought worthy of your gracefull rymes,<br/>That even the greatest did not greatly scorne<br/>To heare theyr names sung in your simple layes,<br/>But joyed in theyr praise;<br/>And when ye list your owne mishaps to mourne,<br/>Which death, or love, or fortunes wreck did rayse,<br/>Your string could soone to sadder tenor turne,<br/>And teach the woods and waters to lament<br/>Your dolefull dreriment:<br/>Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside;<br/>And, having all your heads with girlands crownd,<br/>Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound;<br/>Ne let the same of any be envide:<br/>So Orpheus did for his owne bride!<br/>So I unto my selfe alone will sing;<br/>The woods shall to me answer, and my Eccho ring.<br/><br/>Early, before the worlds light-giving lampe<br/>His golden beame upon the hils doth spred,<br/>Having disperst the nights unchearefull dampe,<br/>Doe ye awake; and, with fresh lusty-hed,<br/>Go to the bowre of my beloved love,<br/>My truest turtle dove;<br/>Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,<br/>And long since ready forth his maske to move,<br/>With his bright Tead that flames with many a flake,<br/>And many a bachelor to waite on him,<br/>In theyr fresh garments trim.<br/>Bid her awake therefore, and soone her dight,<br/>For lo! the wished day is come at last,<br/>That shall, for all the paynes and sorrowes past,<br/>Pay to her usury of long delight:<br/>And, whylest she doth her dight,<br/>Doe ye to her of joy and solace sing,<br/>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.<br/><br/>Bring with you all the Nymphes that you can heare<br/>Both of the rivers and the forrests greene,<br/>And of the sea that neighbours to her neare:<br/>Al with gay girlands goodly wel beseene.<br/>And let them also with them bring in hand<br/>Another gay girland<br/>For my fayre love, of lillyes and of roses,<br/>Bound truelove wize, with a blew silke riband.<br/>And let them make great store of bridale poses,<br/>And let them eeke bring store of other flowers,<br/>To deck the bridale bowers.<br/>And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,<br/>For feare the stones her tender foot should wrong,<br/>Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,<br/>And diapred lyke the discolored mead.<br/>Which done, doe at her chamber dore awayt,<br/>For she will waken strayt;<br/>The whiles doe ye this song unto her sing,<br/>The woods shall to you answer, and your Eccho ring.<br/><br/>Ye Nymphes of Mulla, which with carefull heed<br/>The silver scaly trouts doe tend full well,<br/>And greedy pikes which use therein to feed;<br/>(Those trouts and pikes all others doo excell;)<br/>And ye likewise, which keepe the rushy lake,<br/>Where none doo fishes take;<br/>Bynd up the locks the which hang scatterd light,<br/>And in his waters, which your mirror make,<br/>Behold your faces as the christall bright,<br/>That when you come whereas my love doth lie,<br/>No blemish she may spie.<br/>And eke, ye lightfoot mayds, which keepe the deere,<br/>That on the hoary mountayne used to towre;<br/>And the wylde wolves, which seeke them to devoure,<br/>With your steele darts doo chace from comming neer;<br/>Be also present heere,<br/>To helpe to decke her, and to help to sing,<br/>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.<br/><br/>Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time;<br/>The Rosy Morne long since left Tithones bed,<br/>All ready to her silver coche to clyme;<br/>And Phoebus gins to shew his glorious hed.<br/>Hark! how the cheerefull birds do chaunt theyr laies<br/>And carroll of Loves praise.<br/>The merry Larke hir mattins sings aloft;<br/>The Thrush replyes; the Mavis descant playes;<br/>The Ouzell shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;<br/>So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,<br/>To this dayes merriment.<br/>Ah! my deere love, why doe ye sleepe thus long?<br/>When meeter were that ye should now awake,<br/>T' awayt the comming of your joyous make,<br/>And hearken to the birds love-learned song,<br/>The deawy leaves among!<br/>Nor they of joy and pleasance to you sing,<br/>That all the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring.<br/><br/>My love is now awake out of her dreames,<br/>And her fayre eyes, like stars that dimmed were<br/>With darksome cloud, now shew theyr goodly beams<br/>More bright then Hesperus his head doth rere.<br/>Come now, ye damzels, daughters of delight,<br/>Helpe quickly her to dight:<br/>But first come ye fayre houres, which were begot<br/>In Joves sweet paradice of Day and Night;<br/>Which doe the seasons of the yeare allot,<br/>And al, that ever in this world is fayre,<br/>Doe make and still repayre:<br/>And ye three handmayds of the Cyprian Queene,<br/>The which doe still adorne her beauties pride,<br/>Helpe to addorne my beautifullest bride:<br/>And, as ye her array, still throw betweene<br/>Some graces to be seene;<br/>And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,<br/>The whiles the woods shal answer, and your eccho ring.<br/><br/>Now is my love all ready forth to come:<br/>Let all the virgins therefore well awayt:<br/>And ye fresh boyes, that tend upon her groome,<br/>Prepare your selves; for he is comming strayt.<br/>Set all your things in seemely good aray,<br/>Fit for so joyfull day:<br/>The joyfulst day that ever sunne did see.<br/>Faire Sun! shew forth thy favourable ray,<br/>And let thy lifull heat not fervent be,<br/>For feare of burning her sunshyny face,<br/>Her beauty to disgrace.<br/>O fayrest Phoebus! father of the Muse!<br/>If ever I did honour thee aright,<br/>Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,<br/>Doe not thy servants simple boone refuse;<br/>But let this day, let this one day, be myne;<br/>Let all the rest be thine.<br/>Then I thy soverayne prayses loud wil sing,<br/>That all the woods shal answer, and theyr eccho ring.<br/><br/>Harke! how the Minstrils gin to shrill aloud<br/>Their merry Musick that resounds from far,<br/>The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling Croud,<br/>That well agree withouten breach or jar.<br/>But, most of all, the Damzels doe delite<br/>When they their tymbrels smyte,<br/>And thereunto doe daunce and carrol sweet,<br/>That all the sences they doe ravish quite;<br/>The whyles the boyes run up and downe the street,<br/>Crying aloud with strong confused noyce,<br/>As if it were one voyce,<br/>Hymen, i√∂ Hymen, Hymen, they do shout;<br/>That even to the heavens theyr shouting shrill<br/>Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;<br/>To which the people standing all about,<br/>As in approvance, doe thereto applaud,<br/>And loud advaunce her laud;<br/>And evermore they Hymen, Hymen sing,<br/>That al the woods them answer, and theyr eccho ring.<br/><br/>Loe! where she comes along with portly pace,<br/>Lyke Phoebe, from her chamber of the East,<br/>Arysing forth to run her mighty race,<br/>Clad all in white, that seemes a virgin best.<br/>So well it her beseemes, that ye would weene<br/>Some angell she had beene.<br/>Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,<br/>Sprinckled with perle, and perling flowres atweene,<br/>Doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre;<br/>And, being crowned with a girland greene,<br/>Seeme lyke some mayden Queene.<br/>Her modest eyes, abashed to behold<br/>So many gazers as on her do stare,<br/>Upon the lowly ground affixed are;<br/>Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,<br/>But blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,<br/>So farre from being proud.<br/>Nathlesse doe ye still loud her prayses sing,<br/>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.<br/><br/>Tell me, ye merchants daughters, did ye see<br/>So fayre a creature in your towne before;<br/>So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,<br/>Adornd with beautyes grace and vertues store?<br/>Her goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining bright,<br/>Her forehead yvory white,<br/>Her cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,<br/>Her lips lyke cherryes charming men to byte,<br/>Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,<br/>Her paps lyke lyllies budded,<br/>Her snowie necke lyke to a marble towre;<br/>And all her body like a pallace fayre,<br/>Ascending up, with many a stately stayre,<br/>To honors seat and chastities sweet bowre.<br/>Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,<br/>Upon her so to gaze,<br/>Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,<br/>To which the woods did answer, and your eccho ring?<br/><br/>But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,<br/>The inward beauty of her lively spright,<br/>Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree,<br/>Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,<br/>And stand astonisht lyke to those which red<br/>Medusaes mazeful hed.<br/>There dwels sweet love, and constant chastity,<br/>Unspotted fayth, and comely womanhood,<br/>Regard of honour, and mild modesty;<br/>There vertue raynes as Queene in royal throne,<br/>And giveth lawes alone,<br/>The which the base affections doe obay,<br/>And yeeld theyr services unto her will;<br/>Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may<br/>Thereto approch to tempt her mind to ill.<br/>Had ye once seene these her celestial threasures,<br/>And unrevealed pleasures,<br/>Then would ye wonder, and her prayses sing,<br/>That al the woods should answer, and your echo ring.<br/><br/>Open the temple gates unto my love,<br/>Open them wide that she may enter in,<br/>And all the postes adorne as doth behove,<br/>And all the pillours deck with girlands trim,<br/>For to receyve this Saynt with honour dew,<br/>That commeth in to you.<br/>With trembling steps, and humble reverence,<br/>She commeth in, before th' Almighties view;<br/>Of her ye virgins learne obedience,<br/>When so ye come into those holy places,<br/>To humble your proud faces:<br/>Bring her up to th' high altar, that she may<br/>The sacred ceremonies there partake,<br/>The which do endlesse matrimony make;<br/>And let the roring Organs loudly play<br/>The praises of the Lord in lively notes;<br/>The whiles, with hollow throates,<br/>The Choristers the joyous Antheme sing,<br/>That al the woods may answere, and their eccho ring.<br/><br/>Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,<br/>Hearing the holy priest that to her speakes,<br/>And blesseth her with his two happy hands,<br/>How the red roses flush up in her cheekes,<br/>And the pure snow, with goodly vermill stayne<br/>Like crimsin dyde in grayne:<br/>That even th' Angels, which continually<br/>About the sacred Altare doe remaine,<br/>Forget their service and about her fly,<br/>Ofte peeping in her face, that seems more fayre,<br/>The more they on it stare.<br/>But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,<br/>Are governed with goodly modesty,<br/>That suffers not one looke to glaunce awry,<br/>Which may let in a little thought unsownd.<br/>Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,<br/>The pledge of all our band!<br/>Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluya sing,<br/>That all the woods may answere, and your eccho ring.<br/><br/>Now al is done: bring home the bride againe;<br/>Bring home the triumph of our victory:<br/>Bring home with you the glory of her gaine;<br/>With joyance bring her and with jollity.<br/>Never had man more joyfull day then this,<br/>Whom heaven would heape with blis,<br/>Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;<br/>This day for ever to me holy is.<br/>Poure out the wine without restraint or stay,<br/>Poure not by cups, but by the belly full,<br/>Poure out to all that wull,<br/>And sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,<br/>That they may sweat, and drunken be withall.<br/>Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,<br/>And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine;<br/>And let the Graces daunce unto the rest,<br/>For they can doo it best:<br/>The whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,<br/>To which the woods shall answer, and theyr eccho ring.<br/><br/>Ring ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,<br/>And leave your wonted labors for this day:<br/>This day is holy; doe ye write it downe,<br/>That ye for ever it remember may.<br/>This day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,<br/>With Barnaby the bright,<br/>From whence declining daily by degrees,<br/>He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,<br/>When once the Crab behind his back he sees.<br/>But for this time it ill ordained was,<br/>To chose the longest day in all the yeare,<br/>And shortest night, when longest fitter weare:<br/>Yet never day so long, but late would passe.<br/>Ring ye the bels, to make it weare away,<br/>And bonefiers make all day;<br/>And daunce about them, and about them sing,<br/>That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.<br/><br/>Ah! when will this long weary day have end,<br/>And lende me leave to come unto my love?<br/>How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?<br/>How slowly does sad Time his feathers move?<br/>Hast thee, O fayrest Planet, to thy home,<br/>Within the Westerne fome:<br/>Thy tyred steedes long since have need of rest.<br/>Long though it be, at last I see it gloome,<br/>And the bright evening-star with golden creast<br/>Appeare out of the East.<br/>Fayre childe of beauty! glorious lampe of love!<br/>That all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,<br/>And guydest lovers through the nights sad dread,<br/>How chearefully thou lookest from above,<br/>And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light,<br/>As joying in the sight<br/>Of these glad many, which for joy doe sing,<br/>That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring!<br/><br/>Now ceasse, ye damsels, your delights fore-past;<br/>Enough it is that all the day was youres:<br/>Now day is doen, and night is nighing fast,<br/>Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.<br/>The night is come, now soon her disaray,<br/>And in her bed her lay;<br/>Lay her in lillies and in violets,<br/>And silken courteins over her display,<br/>And odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets.<br/>Behold how goodly my faire love does ly,<br/>In proud humility!<br/>Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took<br/>In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,<br/>Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,<br/>With bathing in the Acidalian brooke.<br/>Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon,<br/>And leave my love alone,<br/>And leave likewise your former lay to sing:<br/>The woods no more shall answere, nor your echo ring.<br/><br/>Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,<br/>That long daies labour doest at last defray,<br/>And all my cares, which cruell Love collected,<br/>Hast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:<br/>Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,<br/>That no man may us see;<br/>And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,<br/>From feare of perrill and foule horror free.<br/>Let no false treason seeke us to entrap,<br/>Nor any dread disquiet once annoy<br/>The safety of our joy;<br/>But let the night be calme, and quietsome,<br/>Without tempestuous storms or sad afray:<br/>Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,<br/>When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:<br/>Or lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie<br/>And begot Majesty.<br/>And let the mayds and yong men cease to sing;<br/>Ne let the woods them answer nor theyr eccho ring.<br/><br/>Let no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,<br/>Be heard all night within, nor yet without:<br/>Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,<br/>Breake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout.<br/>Let no deluding dreames, nor dreadfull sights,<br/>Make sudden sad affrights;<br/>Ne let house-fyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,<br/>Ne let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,<br/>Ne let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,<br/>Ne let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,<br/>Fray us with things that be not:<br/>Let not the shriech Oule nor the Storke be heard,<br/>Nor the night Raven, that still deadly yels;<br/>Nor damned ghosts, cald up with mighty spels,<br/>Nor griesly vultures, make us once affeard:<br/>Ne let th' unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking<br/>Make us to wish theyr choking.<br/>Let none of these theyr drery accents sing;<br/>Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.<br/><br/>But let stil Silence trew night-watches keepe,<br/>That sacred Peace may in assurance rayne,<br/>And tymely Sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,<br/>May poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne;<br/>The whiles an hundred little winged loves,<br/>Like divers-fethered doves,<br/>Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,<br/>And in the secret darke, that none reproves,<br/>Their prety stealthes shal worke, and snares shal spread<br/>To filch away sweet snatches of delight,<br/>Conceald through covert night.<br/>Ye sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will!<br/>For greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,<br/>Thinks more upon her paradise of joyes,<br/>Then what ye do, albe it good or ill.<br/>All night therefore attend your merry play,<br/>For it will soone be day:<br/>Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing;<br/>Ne will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.<br/><br/>Who is the same, which at my window peepes?<br/>Or whose is that faire face that shines so bright?<br/>Is it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,<br/>But walkes about high heaven al the night?<br/>O! fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy<br/>My love with me to spy:<br/>For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,<br/>And for a fleece of wooll, which privily<br/>The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought,<br/>His pleasures with thee wrought.<br/>Therefore to us be favorable now;<br/>And sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,<br/>And generation goodly dost enlarge,<br/>Encline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,<br/>And the chast wombe informe with timely seed<br/>That may our comfort breed:<br/>Till which we cease our hopefull hap to sing;<br/>Ne let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.<br/><br/>And thou, great Juno! which with awful might<br/>The lawes of wedlock still dost patronize;<br/>And the religion of the faith first plight<br/>With sacred rites hast taught to solemnize;<br/>And eeke for comfort often called art<br/>Of women in their smart;<br/>Eternally bind thou this lovely band,<br/>And all thy blessings unto us impart.<br/>And thou, glad Genius! in whose gentle hand<br/>The bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,<br/>Without blemish or staine;<br/>And the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight<br/>With secret ayde doest succour and supply,<br/>Till they bring forth the fruitfull progeny;<br/>Send us the timely fruit of this same night.<br/>And thou, fayre Hebe! and thou, Hymen free!<br/>Grant that it may so be.<br/>Til which we cease your further prayse to sing;<br/>Ne any woods shall answer, nor your Eccho ring.<br/><br/>And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,<br/>In which a thousand torches flaming bright<br/>Doe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods<br/>In dreadful darknesse lend desired light<br/>And all ye powers which in the same remayne,<br/>More then we men can fayne!<br/>Poure out your blessing on us plentiously,<br/>And happy influence upon us raine,<br/>That we may raise a large posterity,<br/>Which from the earth, which they may long possesse<br/>With lasting happinesse,<br/>Up to your haughty pallaces may mount;<br/>And, for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit,<br/>May heavenly tabernacles there inherit,<br/>Of blessed Saints for to increase the count.<br/>So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,<br/>And cease till then our tymely joyes to sing:<br/>The woods no more us answer, nor our eccho ring!<br/><br/>Song! made in lieu of many ornaments,<br/>With which my love should duly have been dect,<br/>Which cutting off through hasty accidents,<br/>Ye would not stay your dew time to expect,<br/>But promist both to recompens;<br/>Be unto her a goodly ornament,<br/>And for short time an endlesse moniment.
