  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ from Jubilate Agno, Fragment B, lines 695-768 by *Christopher Smart*

<p>
    For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.<br/>For he is the servant of the Living God, duly and daily serving him.<br/>For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.<br/>For is this done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.<br/>For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.<br/>For he rolls upon prank to work it in.<br/>For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.<br/>For this he performs in ten degrees.<br/>For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.<br/>For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.<br/>For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.<br/>For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.<br/>For fifthly he washes himself.<br/>For sixthly he rolls upon wash.<br/>For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.<br/>For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.<br/>For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.<br/>For tenthly he goes in quest of food.<br/>For having considered God and himself he will consider his neighbor.<br/>For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.<br/>For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.<br/>For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.<br/>For when his day's work is done his business more properly begins.<br/>For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary.<br/>For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.<br/>For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.<br/>For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.<br/>For he is of the tribe of Tiger.<br/>For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.<br/>For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.<br/>For he will not do destruction if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.<br/>For he purrs in thankfulness when God tells him he's a good Cat.<br/>For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.<br/>For every house is incomplete without him, and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.<br/>For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel<br/>from Egypt.<br/>For every family had one cat at least in the bag.<br/>For the English Cats are the best in Europe.<br/>For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.<br/>For the dexterity of his defense is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.<br/>For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.<br/>For he is tenacious of his point.<br/>For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.<br/>For he knows that God is his Saviour.<br/>For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.<br/>For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.<br/>For he is of the Lord's poor, and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually--Poor Jeoffry!<br/>poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.<br/>For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.<br/>For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.<br/>For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.<br/>For he is docile and can learn certain things.<br/>For he can sit up with gravity, which is patience upon approbation.<br/>For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.<br/>For he can jump over a stick, which is patience upon proof positive.<br/>For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.<br/>For he can jump from an eminence into his master's bosom.<br/>For he can catch the cork and toss it again.<br/>For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.<br/>For the former is afraid of detection.<br/>For the latter refuses the charge.<br/>For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.<br/>For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.<br/>For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.<br/>For he killed the Icneumon rat, very pernicious by land.<br/>For his ears are so acute that they sting again.<br/>For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.<br/>For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.<br/>For I perceived God's light about him both wax and fire.<br/>For the electrical fire is the spiritual substance which God sends from heaven to sustain the<br/>bodies both of man and beast.<br/>For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.<br/>For, though he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.<br/>For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.<br/>For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.<br/>For he can swim for life.<br/>For he can creep.
