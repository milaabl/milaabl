# üíÆ Comus by *John Milton*

<p>
    A Masque Presented At Ludlow Castle, 1634, Before<br/><br/>The Earl Of Bridgewater, Then President Of Wales.<br/><br/>The Persons<br/><br/>        The ATTENDANT SPIRIT, afterwards in the habit of THYRSIS.<br/>COMUS, with his Crew.<br/>The LADY.<br/>FIRST BROTHER.<br/>SECOND BROTHER.<br/>SABRINA, the Nymph.<br/><br/>The Chief Persons which presented were:‚Äî<br/><br/>The Lord Brackley;<br/>Mr. Thomas Egerton, his Brother;<br/>The Lady Alice Egerton.<br/><br/><br/>The first Scene discovers a wild wood.<br/>The ATTENDANT SPIRIT descends or enters.<br/><br/><br/>BEFORE the starry threshold of Jove's court<br/>My mansion is, where those immortal shapes<br/>Of bright aerial spirits live insphered<br/>In regions mild of calm and serene air,<br/>Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot<br/>Which men call Earth, and, with low-thoughted care,<br/>Confined and pestered in this pinfold here,<br/>Strive to keep up a frail and feverish being,<br/>Unmindful of the crown that Virtue gives,<br/>After this mortal change, to her true servants<br/>Amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats.<br/>Yet some there be that by due steps aspire<br/>To lay their just hands on that golden key<br/>That opes the palace of eternity.<br/>To Such my errand is; and, but for such,<br/>I would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds<br/>With the rank vapours of this sin-worn mould.<br/>         But to my task. Neptune, besides the sway<br/>Of every salt flood and each ebbing stream,<br/>Took in by lot, 'twixt high and nether Jove,<br/>Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles<br/>That, like to rich and various gems, inlay<br/>The unadorned bosom of the deep;<br/>Which he, to grace his tributary gods,<br/>By course commits to several government,<br/>And gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns<br/>And wield their little tridents. But this Isle,<br/>The greatest and the best of all the main,<br/>He quarters to his blue-haired deities;<br/>And all this tract that fronts the falling sun<br/>A noble Peer of mickle trust and power<br/>Has in his charge, with tempered awe to guide<br/>An old and haughty nation, proud in arms:<br/>Where his fair offspring, nursed in princely lore,<br/>Are coming to attend their father's state,<br/>And new-intrusted sceptre. But their way<br/>Lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood,<br/>The nodding horror of whose shady brows<br/>Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger;<br/>And here their tender age might suffer peril,<br/>But that, by quick command from sovran Jove,<br/>I was despatched for their defence and guard:<br/>And listen why; for I will tell you now<br/>What never yet was heard in tale or song,<br/>From old or modern bard, in hall or bower.<br/>         Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape<br/>Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine,<br/>After the Tuscan mariners transformed,<br/>Coasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,<br/>On Circe's island fell. (Who knows not Circe,<br/>The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup<br/>Whoever tasted lost his upright shape,<br/>And downward fell into a grovelling swine?)<br/>This Nymph, that gazed upon his clustering locks,<br/>With ivy berries wreathed, and his blithe youth,<br/>Had by him, ere he parted thence, a son<br/>Much like his father, but his mother more,<br/>Whom therefore she brought up, and Comus named:<br/>Who, ripe and frolic of his full-grown age,<br/>Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields,<br/>At last betakes him to this ominous wood,<br/>And, in thick shelter of black shades imbowered,<br/>Excels his mother at her mighty art;<br/>Offering to every weary traveller<br/>His orient liquor in a crystal glass,<br/>To quench the drouth of Phoebus; which as they taste<br/>(For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst),<br/>Soon as the potion works, their human count'nance,<br/>The express resemblance of the gods, is changed<br/>Into some brutish form of wolf or bear,<br/>Or ounce or tiger, hog, or bearded goat,<br/>All other parts remaining as they were.<br/>And they, so perfect is their misery,<br/>Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,<br/>But boast themselves more comely than before,<br/>And all their friends and native home forget,<br/>To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.<br/>Therefore, when any favoured of high Jove<br/>Chances to pass through this adventurous glade,<br/>Swift as the sparkle of a glancing star<br/>I shoot from heaven, to give him safe convoy,<br/>As now I do. But first I must put off<br/>These my sky-robes, spun out of Iris' woof,<br/>And take the weeds and likeness of a swain<br/>That to the service of this house belongs,<br/>Who, with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song,<br/>Well knows to still the wild winds when they roar,<br/>And hush the waving woods; nor of less faith<br/>And in this office of his mountain watch<br/>Likeliest, and nearest to the present aid<br/>Of this occasion. But I hear the tread<br/>Of hateful steps; I must be viewless now.<br/><br/><br/>COMUS enters, with a charming-rod in one hand, his glass in the<br/>other: with him a rout of monsters, headed like sundry sorts of<br/>wild<br/>beasts, but otherwise like men and women, their apparel<br/>glistering.<br/>They come in making a riotous and unruly noise, with torches in<br/>their hands.<br/><br/><br/>         COMUS. The star that bids the shepherd fold<br/>Now the top of heaven doth hold;<br/>And the gilded car of day<br/>His glowing axle doth allay<br/>In the steep Atlantic stream;<br/>And the slope sun his upward beam<br/>Shoots against the dusky pole,<br/>Pacing toward the other goal<br/>Of his chamber in the east.<br/>Meanwhile, welcome joy and feast,<br/>Midnight shout and revelry,<br/>Tipsy dance and jollity.<br/>Braid your locks with rosy twine,<br/>Dropping odours, dropping wine.<br/>Rigour now is gone to bed;<br/>And Advice with scrupulous head,<br/>Strict Age, and sour Severity,<br/>With their grave saws, in slumber lie.<br/>We, that are of purer fire,<br/>Imitate the starry quire,<br/>Who, in their nightly watchful spheres,<br/>Lead in swift round the months and years.<br/>The sounds and seas, with all their finny drove,<br/>Now to the moon in wavering morrice move;<br/>And on the tawny sands and shelves<br/>Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves.<br/>By dimpled brook and fountain-brim,<br/>The wood-nymphs, decked with daisies trim,<br/>Their merry wakes and pastimes keep:<br/>What hath night to do with sleep?<br/>Night hath better sweets to prove;<br/>Venus now wakes, and wakens Love.<br/>Come, let us our rights begin;<br/>'T is only daylight that makes sin,<br/>Which these dun shades will ne'er report.<br/>Hail, goddess of nocturnal sport,<br/>Dark-veiled Cotytto, to whom the secret flame<br/>Of midnight torches burns! mysterious dame,<br/>That ne'er art called but when the dragon womb<br/>Of Stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom,<br/>And makes one blot of all the air!<br/>Stay thy cloudy ebon chair,<br/>Wherein thou ridest with Hecat', and befriend<br/>Us thy vowed priests, till utmost end<br/>Of all thy dues be done, and none left out,<br/>Ere the blabbing eastern scout,<br/>The nice Morn on the Indian steep,<br/>From her cabined loop-hole peep,<br/>And to the tell-tale Sun descry<br/>Our concealed solemnity.<br/>Come, knit hands, and beat the ground<br/>In a light fantastic round.<br/><br/>                              The Measure.<br/><br/>         Break off, break off! I feel the different pace<br/>Of some chaste footing near about this ground.<br/>Run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees;<br/>Our number may affright. Some virgin sure<br/>(For so I can distinguish by mine art)<br/>Benighted in these woods! Now to my charms,<br/>And to my wily trains: I shall ere long<br/>Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed<br/>About my mother Circe. Thus I hurl<br/>My dazzling spells into the spongy air,<br/>Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,<br/>And give it false presentments, lest the place<br/>And my quaint habits breed astonishment,<br/>And put the damsel to suspicious flight;<br/>Which must not be, for that's against my course.<br/>I, under fair pretence of friendly ends,<br/>And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,<br/>Baited with reasons not unplausible,<br/>Wind me into the easy-hearted man,<br/>And hug him into snares. When once her eye<br/>Hath met the virtue of this magic dust,<br/>I shall appear some harmless villager<br/>Whom thrift keeps up about his country gear.<br/>But here she comes; I fairly step aside,<br/>And hearken, if I may her business hear.<br/><br/>The LADY enters.<br/><br/>         LADY. This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,<br/>My best guide now. Methought it was the sound<br/>Of riot and ill-managed merriment,<br/>Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe<br/>Stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds,<br/>When, for their teeming flocks and granges full,<br/>In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan,<br/>And thank the gods amiss. I should be loth<br/>To meet the rudeness and swilled insolence<br/>Of such late wassailers; yet, oh! where else<br/>Shall I inform my unacquainted feet<br/>In the blind mazes of this tangled wood?<br/>My brothers, when they saw me wearied out<br/>With this long way, resolving here to lodge<br/>Under the spreading favour of these pines,<br/>Stepped, as they said, to the next thicket-side<br/>To bring me berries, or such cooling fruit<br/>As the kind hospitable woods provide.<br/>They left me then when the grey-hooded Even,<br/>Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,<br/>Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain.<br/>But where they are, and why they came not back,<br/>Is now the labour of my thoughts. TTis likeliest<br/>They had engaged their wandering steps too far;<br/>And envious darkness, ere they could return,<br/>Had stole them from me. Else, O thievish Night,<br/>Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,<br/>In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars<br/>That Nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps<br/>With everlasting oil to give due light<br/>To the misled and lonely traveller?<br/>This is the place, as well as I may guess,<br/>Whence even now the tumult of loud mirth<br/>Was rife, and perfect in my listening ear;<br/>Yet nought but single darkness do I find.<br/>What might this be ? A thousand fantasies<br/>Begin to throng into my memory,<br/>Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,<br/>And airy tongues that syllable men's names<br/>On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.<br/>These thoughts may startle well, but not astound<br/>The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended<br/>By a strong siding champion, Conscience.<br/>O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,<br/>Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,<br/>And thou unblemished form of Chastity!<br/>I see ye visibly, and now believe<br/>That He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill<br/>Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,<br/>Would send a glistering guardian, if need were,<br/>To keep my life and honour unassailed. . . .<br/>Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud<br/>Turn forth her silver lining on the night?<br/>I did not err: there does a sable cloud<br/>Turn forth her silver lining on the night,<br/>And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.<br/>I cannot hallo to my brothers, but<br/>Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest<br/>I'll venture; for my new-enlivened spirits<br/>Prompt me, and they perhaps are not far off.<br/><br/>Song.<br/><br/>Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen<br/>                 Within thy airy shell<br/>         By slow Meander's margent green,<br/>And in the violet-embroidered vale<br/>         Where the love-lorn nightingale<br/>Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:<br/>Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair<br/>         That likest thy Narcissus are?<br/>                  O, if thou have<br/>         Hid them in some flowery cave,<br/>                  Tell me but where,<br/>         Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere!<br/>         So may'st thou be translated to the skies,<br/>And give resounding grace to all Heaven's harmonies!<br/><br/><br/>         COMUS. Can any mortal mixture of earthUs mould<br/>Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?<br/>Sure something holy lodges in that breast,<br/>And with these raptures moves the vocal air<br/>To testify his hidden residence.<br/>How sweetly did they float upon the wings<br/>Of silence, through the empty-vaulted night,<br/>At every fall smoothing the raven down<br/>Of darkness till it smiled! I have oft heard<br/>My mother Circe with the Sirens three,<br/>Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,<br/>Culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs,<br/>Who, as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,<br/>And lap it in Elysium: Scylla wept,<br/>And chid her barking waves into attention,<br/>And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause.<br/>Yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,<br/>And in sweet madness robbed it of itself;<br/>But such a sacred and home-felt delight,<br/>Such sober certainty of waking bliss,<br/>I never heard till now. I'll speak to her,<br/>And she shall be my queen.QHail, foreign wonder!<br/>Whom certain these rough shades did never breed,<br/>Unless the goddess that in rural shrine<br/>Dwell'st here with Pan or Sylvan, by blest song<br/>Forbidding every bleak unkindly fog<br/>To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood.<br/>         LADY. Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is lost that praise<br/>That is addressed to unattending ears.<br/>Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift<br/>How to regain my severed company,<br/>Compelled me to awake the courteous Echo<br/>To give me answer from her mossy couch.<br/>         COMUS: What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?<br/>         LADY. Dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth.<br/>         COMUS. Could that divide you from near-ushering guides?<br/>         LADY. They left me weary on a grassy turf.<br/>         COMUS. By falsehood, or discourtesy, or why?<br/>         LADY. To seek i' the valley some cool friendly spring.<br/>         COMUS. And left your fair side all unguarded, Lady?<br/>         LADY. They were but twain, and purposed quick return.<br/>         COMUS. Perhaps forestalling night prevented them.<br/>         LADY. How easy my misfortune is to hit!<br/>         COMUS. Imports their loss, beside the present need?<br/>         LADY. No less than if I should my brothers lose.<br/>         COMUS. Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom?<br/>         LADY. As smooth as Hebe's their unrazored lips.<br/>         COMUS. Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox<br/>In his loose traces from the furrow came,<br/>And the swinked hedger at his supper sat.<br/>I saw them under a green mantling vine,<br/>That crawls along the side of yon small hill,<br/>Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots;<br/>Their port was more than human, as they stood.<br/>I took it for a faery vision<br/>Of some gay creatures of the element,<br/>That in the colours of the rainbow live,<br/>And play i' the plighted clouds. I was awe-strook,<br/>And, as I passed, I worshiped. If those you seek,<br/>It were a journey like the path to Heaven<br/>To help you find them.<br/>         LADY.                          Gentle villager,<br/>What readiest way would bring me to that place?<br/>         COMUS. Due west it rises from this shrubby point.<br/>         LADY. To find out that, good shepherd, I suppose,<br/>In such a scant allowance of star-light,<br/>Would overtask the best land-pilot's art,<br/>Without the sure guess of well-practised feet.<br/>        COMUS. I know each lane, and every alley green,<br/>Dingle, or bushy dell, of this wild wood,<br/>And every bosky bourn from side to side,<br/>My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood;<br/>And, if your stray attendance be yet lodged,<br/>Or shroud within these limits, I shall know<br/>Ere morrow wake, or the low-roosted lark<br/>From her thatched pallet rouse. If otherwise,<br/>I can conduct you, Lady, to a low<br/>But loyal cottage, where you may be safe<br/>Till further quest.<br/>         LADY.        Shepherd, I take thy word,<br/>And trust thy honest-offered courtesy,<br/>Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds,<br/>With smoky rafters, than in tapestry halls<br/>And courts of princes, where it first was named,<br/>And yet is most pretended. In a place<br/>Less warranted than this, or less secure,<br/>I cannot be, that I should fear to change it.<br/>Eye me, blest Providence, and square my trial<br/>To my proportioned strength! Shepherd, lead on.<br/><br/>The TWO BROTHERS.<br/><br/>         ELD. BRO. Unmuffle, ye faint stars; and thou, fair moon,<br/>That wont'st to love the traveller's benison,<br/>Stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,<br/>And disinherit Chaos, that reigns here<br/>In double night of darkness and of shades;<br/>Or, if your influence be quite dammed up<br/>With black usurping mists, some gentle taper,<br/>Though a rush-candle from the wicker hole<br/>Of some clay habitation, visit us<br/>With thy long levelled rule of streaming light,<br/>And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,<br/>Or Tyrian Cynosure.<br/>         SEC. BRO.                    Or, if our eyes<br/>Be barred that happiness, might we but hear<br/>The folded flocks, penned in their wattled cotes,<br/>Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,<br/>Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock<br/>Count the night-watches to his feathery dames,<br/>'T would be some solace yet, some little cheering,<br/>In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs.<br/>But, oh, that hapless virgin, our lost sister!<br/>Where may she wander now, whither betake her<br/>From the chill dew, amongst rude burs and thistles<br/>Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now,<br/>Or 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm<br/>Leans her unpillowed head, fraught with sad fears.<br/>What if in wild amazement and affright,<br/>Or, while we speak, within the direful grasp<br/>Of savage hunger, or of savage heat!<br/>         ELD. BRO. Peace, brother: be not over-exquisite<br/>To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;<br/>For, grant they be so, while they rest unknown,<br/>What need a man forestall his date of grief,<br/>And run to meet what he would most avoid?<br/>Or, if they be but false alarms of fear,<br/>How bitter is such self-delusion!<br/>I do not think my sister so to seek,<br/>Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,<br/>And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,<br/>As that the single want of light and noise<br/>(Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)<br/>Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,<br/>And put them into misbecoming plight.<br/>Virtue could see to do what Virtue would<br/>By her own radiant light, though sun and moon<br/>Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self<br/>Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,<br/>Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,<br/>She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,<br/>That, in the various bustle of resort,<br/>Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired.<br/>He that has light within his own clear breast<br/>May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:<br/>But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts<br/>Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;<br/>Himself is his own dungeon.<br/>         SEC. BRO.                             'Tis most true<br/>That musing meditation most affects<br/>The pensive secrecy of desert cell,<br/>Far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds,<br/>And sits as safe as in a senate house<br/>For who would rob a hermit of his weeds,<br/>His few books, or his beads, or maple dish,<br/>Or do his grey hairs any violence?<br/>But Beauty, like the fair Hesperian tree<br/>Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard<br/>Of dragon-watch with unenchanted eye<br/>To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit,<br/>From the rash hand of bold Incontinence.<br/>You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps<br/>Of miser's treasure by an outlaw's den,<br/>And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope<br/>Danger will wink on Opportunity,<br/>And let a single helpless maiden pass<br/>Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.<br/>Of night or loneliness it recks me not;<br/>I fear the dread events that dog them both,<br/>Lest some ill-greeting touch attempt the person<br/>Of our unowned sister.<br/>         ELD. BRO.

To the ocean now I fly,<br/>And those happy climes that lie<br/>Where day never shuts his eye,<br/>Up in the broad fields of the sky.<br/>There I suck the liquid air,<br/>All amidst the gardens fair<br/>Of Hesperus, and his daughters three<br/>That sing about the golden tree.<br/>Along the crisped shades and bowers<br/>Revels the spruce and jocund Spring;<br/>The Graces and the rosy-bosomed Hours<br/>Thither all their bounties bring.<br/>There eternal Summer dwells;<br/>And west winds with musky wing<br/>About the cedarn alleys fling<br/>Nard and cassia's balmy smells.<br/>Iris there with humid bow<br/>Waters the odorous banks, that blow<br/>Flowers of more mingled hue<br/>Than her purfled scarf can shew,<br/>And drenches with Elysian dew<br/>(List, mortals, if your ears be true)<br/>Beds of hyacinth and roses,<br/>Where young Adonis oft reposes,<br/>Waxing well of his deep wound,<br/>In slumber soft, and on the ground<br/>Sadly sits the Assyrian queen.<br/>But far above, in spangled sheen,<br/>Celestial Cupid, her famed son, advanced<br/>Holds his dear Psyche, sweet entranced<br/>After her wandering labours long,<br/>Till free consent the gods among<br/>Make her his eternal bride,<br/>And from her fair unspotted side<br/>Two blissful twins are to be born,<br/>Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn.<br/>         But now my task is smoothly done:<br/>I can fly, or I can run,<br/>Quickly to the green earth's end,<br/>Where the bowed welkin slow doth bend,<br/>And from thence can soar as soon<br/>To the corners of the moon.<br/>Mortals, that would follow me,<br/>Love virtue; she alone is free.<br/>She can teach ye how to climb<br/>Higher than the sphery chime;<br/>Or, if Virtue feeble were,<br/>Heaven itself would stoop to her.
