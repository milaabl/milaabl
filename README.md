<!-- Start poem -->
# 💮 Prayer of Columbus. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    A BATTER’D, wreck’d old man,<br/>Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,<br/>Pent by the sea, and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,<br/>Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken’d, and nigh to death,<br/>I take my way along the island’s edge,<br/>Venting a heavy heart.<br/><br/>I am too full of woe!<br/>Haply, I may not live another day;<br/>I can not rest, O God—I can not eat or drink or sleep,<br/>Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,<br/>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee—commune with Thee,<br/>Report myself once more to Thee.<br/><br/>Thou knowest my years entire, my life,<br/>(My long and crowded life of active work—not adoration merely;)<br/>Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth;<br/>Thou knowest my manhood’s solemn and visionary meditations;<br/>Thou knowest how, before I commenced, I devoted all to come to Thee;<br/>Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows, and strictly kept them;<br/>Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee;<br/>(In shackles, prison’d, in disgrace, repining not,<br/>Accepting all from Thee—as duly come from Thee.)<br/><br/>All my emprises have been fill’d with Thee,<br/>My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee,<br/>Sailing the deep, or journeying the land for Thee;<br/>Intentions, purports, aspirations mine—leaving results to Thee.<br/><br/>O I am sure they really come from Thee!<br/>The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,<br/>The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,<br/>A message from the Heavens, whispering to me even in sleep,<br/>These sped me on.<br/><br/>By me, and these, the work so far accomplish’d (for what has been, has been;)<br/>By me Earth’s elder, cloy’d and stifled lands, uncloy’d, unloos’d;<br/>By me the hemispheres rounded and tied—the unknown to the known.<br/><br/>The end I know not—it is all in Thee;<br/>Or small, or great, I know not—haply, what broad fields, what lands;<br/>Haply, the brutish, measureless human undergrowth I know,<br/>Transplanted there, may rise to stature, knowledge worthy Thee;<br/>Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn’d to reaping-tools;<br/>Haply the lifeless cross I know—Europe’s dead cross—may bud and blossom<br/>    there.<br/><br/>One effort more—my altar this bleak sand:<br/>That Thou, O God, my life hast lighted,<br/>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,<br/>(Light rare, untellable—lighting the very light!<br/>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages!)<br/>For that, O God—be it my latest word—here on my knees,<br/>Old, poor, and paralyzed—I thank Thee.<br/><br/>My terminus near,<br/>The clouds already closing in upon me,<br/>The voyage balk’d—the course disputed, lost,<br/>I yield my ships to Thee.<br/><br/>Steersman unseen! henceforth the helms are Thine;<br/>Take Thou command—(what to my petty skill Thy navigation?)<br/>My hands, my limbs grow nerveless;<br/>My brain feels rack’d, bewilder’d; Let the old timbers part—I will not<br/>    part!<br/>I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me;<br/>Thee, Thee, at least, I know.<br/><br/>Is it the prophet’s thought I speak, or am I raving?<br/>What do I know of life? what of myself?<br/>I know not even my own work, past or present;<br/>Dim, ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,<br/>Of newer, better worlds, their mighty parturition,<br/>Mocking, perplexing me.<br/><br/>And these things I see suddenly—what mean they?<br/>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal’d my eyes,<br/>Shadowy, vast shapes, smile through the air and sky,<br/>And on the distant waves sail countless ships,<br/>And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.
