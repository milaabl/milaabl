# üíÆ The Triumph of Life by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Swift as a spirit hastening to his task<br/>Of glory and of good, the Sun sprang forth<br/>Rejoicing in his splendour, and the mask<br/><br/>Of darkness fell from the awakened Earth--<br/>The smokeless altars of the mountain snows<br/>Flamed above crimson clouds, and at the birth<br/><br/>Of light, the Ocean's orison arose,<br/>To which the birds tempered their matin lay.<br/>All flowers in field or forest which unclose<br/><br/>Their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day,<br/>Swinging their censers in the element,<br/>With orient incense lit by the new ray<br/><br/>Burned slow and inconsumably, and sent<br/>Their odorous sighs up to the smiling air;<br/>And, in succession due, did continent,<br/><br/>Isle, ocean, and all things that in them wear<br/>The form and character of mortal mould,<br/>Rise as the Sun their father rose, to bear<br/><br/>Their portion of the toil, which he of old<br/>Took as his own, and then imposed on them:<br/>But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold<br/><br/>Had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem<br/>The cone of night, now they were laid asleep<br/>Stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem<br/><br/>Which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep<br/>Of a green Apennine: before me fled<br/>The night; behind me rose the day; the deep<br/><br/>Was at my feet, and Heaven above my head,--<br/>When a strange trance over my fancy grew<br/>Which was not slumber, for the shade it spread<br/><br/>Was so transparent, that the scene came through<br/>As clear as when a veil of light is drawn<br/>O'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew<br/><br/>That I had felt the freshness of that dawn<br/>Bathe in the same cold dew my brow and hair,<br/>And sate as thus upon that slope of lawn<br/><br/>Under the self-same bough, and heard as there<br/>The birds, the fountains and the ocean hold<br/>Sweet talk in music through the enamoured air,<br/>And then a vision on my train was rolled.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As in that trance of wondrous thought I lay,<br/>This was the tenour of my waking dream:--<br/>Methought I sate beside a public way<br/><br/>Thick strewn with summer dust, and a great stream<br/>Of people there was hurrying to and fro,<br/>Numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,<br/><br/>All hastening onward, yet none seemed to know<br/>Whither he went, or whence he came, or why<br/>He made one of the multitude, and so<br/><br/>Was borne amid the crowd, as through the sky<br/>One of the million leaves of summer's bier;<br/>Old age and youth, manhood and infancy,<br/><br/>Mixed in one mighty torrent did appear,<br/>Some flying from the thing they feared, and some<br/>Seeking the object of another's fear;<br/><br/>And others, as with steps towards the tomb,<br/>Pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,<br/>And others mournfully within the gloom<br/><br/>Of their own shadow walked, and called it death;<br/>And some fled from it as it were a ghost,<br/>Half fainting in the affliction of vain breath:<br/><br/>But more, with motions which each other crossed,<br/>Pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw,<br/>Or birds within the noonday aether lost,<br/><br/>Upon that path where flowers never grew,--<br/>And, weary with vain toil and faint for thirst,<br/>Heard not the fountains, whose melodious dew<br/><br/>Out of their mossy cells forever burst;<br/>Nor felt the breeze which from the forest told<br/>Of grassy paths and wood-lawns interspersed<br/><br/>With overarching elms and caverns cold,<br/>And violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they<br/>Pursued their serious folly as of old.<br/><br/>And as I gazed, methought that in the way<br/>The throng grew wilder, as the woods of June<br/>When the south wind shakes the extinguished day,<br/><br/>And a cold glare, intenser than the noon,<br/>But icy cold, obscured with blinding light<br/>The sun, as he the stars. Like the young moon--<br/><br/>When on the sunlit limits of the night<br/>Her white shell trembles amid crimson air,<br/>And whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might--<br/><br/>Doth, as the herald of its coming, bear<br/>The ghost of its dead mother, whose dim form<br/>Bends in dark aether from her infant's chair,--<br/><br/>So came a chariot on the silent storm<br/>Of its own rushing splendour, and a Shape<br/>So sate within, as one whom years deform,<br/><br/>Beneath a dusky hood and double cape,<br/>Crouching within the shadow of a tomb;<br/>And o'er what seemed the head a cloud-like crape<br/><br/>Was bent, a dun and faint aethereal gloom<br/>Tempering the light. Upon the chariot-beam<br/>A Janus-visaged Shadow did assume<br/><br/>The guidance of that wonder-winged team;<br/>The shapes which drew it in thick lightenings<br/>Were lost:--I heard alone on the air's soft stream<br/><br/>The music of their ever-moving wings.<br/>All the four faces of that Charioteer<br/>Had their eyes banded; little profit brings<br/><br/>Speed in the van and blindness in the rear,<br/>Nor then avail the beams that quench the sun,--<br/>Or that with banded eyes could pierce the sphere<br/><br/>Of all that is, has been or will be done;<br/>So ill was the car guided--but it passed<br/>With solemn speed majestically on.<br/><br/>The crowd gave way, and I arose aghast,<br/>Or seemed to rise, so mighty was the trance,<br/>And saw, like clouds upon the thunder-blast,<br/><br/>The million with fierce song and maniac dance<br/>Raging around--such seemed the jubilee<br/>As when to greet some conqueror's advance<br/><br/>Imperial Rome poured forth her living sea<br/>From senate-house, and forum, and theatre,<br/>When ... upon the free<br/><br/>Had bound a yoke, which soon they stooped to bear.<br/>Nor wanted here the just similitude<br/>Of a triumphal pageant, for where'er<br/><br/>The chariot rolled, a captive multitude<br/>Was driven;--all those who had grown old in power<br/>Or misery,--all who had their age subdued<br/><br/>By action or by suffering, and whose hour<br/>Was drained to its last sand in weal or woe,<br/>So that the trunk survived both fruit and flower;--<br/><br/>All those whose fame or infamy must grow<br/>Till the great winter lay the form and name<br/>Of this green earth with them for ever low;--<br/><br/>All but the sacred few who could not tame<br/>Their spirits to the conquerors--but as soon<br/>As they had touched the world with living flame,<br/><br/>Fled back like eagles to their native noon,<br/>Or those who put aside the diadem<br/>Of earthly thrones or gems...<br/><br/>Were there, of Athens or Jerusalem.<br/>Were neither mid the mighty captives seen,<br/>Nor mid the ribald crowd that followed them,<br/><br/>Nor those who went before fierce and obscene.<br/>The wild dance maddens in the van, and those<br/>Who lead it--fleet as shadows on the green,<br/><br/>Outspeed the chariot, and without repose<br/>Mix with each other in tempestuous measure<br/>To savage music, wilder as it grows,<br/><br/>They, tortured by their agonizing pleasure,<br/>Convulsed and on the rapid whirlwinds spun<br/>Of that fierce Spirit, whose unholy leisure<br/><br/>Was soothed by mischief since the world begun,<br/>Throw back their heads and loose their streaming hair;<br/>And in their dance round her who dims the sun,<br/><br/>Maidens and youths fling their wild arms in air<br/>As their feet twinkle; they recede, and now<br/>Bending within each other's atmosphere,<br/><br/>Kindle invisibly--and as they glow,<br/>Like moths by light attracted and repelled,<br/>Oft to their bright destruction come and go,<br/><br/>Till like two clouds into one vale impelled,<br/>That shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle<br/>And die in rain--the fiery band which held<br/><br/>Their natures, snaps--while the shock still may tingle<br/>One falls and then another in the path<br/>Senseless--nor is the desolation single,<br/><br/>Yet ere I can say WHERE--the chariot hath<br/>Passed over them--nor other trace I find<br/>But as of foam after the ocean's wrath<br/><br/>Is spent upon the desert shore;--behind,<br/>Old men and women foully disarrayed,<br/>Shake their gray hairs in the insulting wind,<br/><br/>And follow in the dance, with limbs decayed,<br/>Seeking to reach the light which leaves them still<br/>Farther behind and deeper in the shade.<br/><br/>But not the less with impotence of will<br/>They wheel, though ghastly shadows interpose<br/>Round them and round each other, and fulfil<br/><br/>Their work, and in the dust from whence they rose<br/>Sink, and corruption veils them as they lie,<br/>And past in these performs what ... in those.<br/><br/>Struck to the heart by this sad pageantry,<br/>Half to myself I said--'And what is this?<br/>Whose shape is that within the car? And why--'<br/><br/>I would have added--'is all here amiss?--'<br/>But a voice answered--'Life!'--I turned, and knew<br/>(O Heaven, have mercy on such wretchedness!)<br/><br/>That what I thought was an old root which grew<br/>To strange distortion out of the hill side,<br/>Was indeed one of those deluded crew,<br/><br/>And that the grass, which methought hung so wide<br/>And white, was but his thin discoloured hair,<br/>And that the holes he vainly sought to hide,<br/><br/>Were or had been eyes:--'If thou canst forbear<br/>To join the dance, which I had well forborne,'<br/>Said the grim Feature, of my thought aware,<br/><br/>'I will unfold that which to this deep scorn<br/>Led me and my companions, and relate<br/>The progress of the pageant since the morn;<br/><br/>'If thirst of knowledge shall not then abate,<br/>Follow it thou even to the night, but I<br/>Am weary.'--Then like one who with the weight<br/><br/>Of his own words is staggered, wearily<br/>He paused; and ere he could resume, I cried:<br/>'First, who art thou?'--'Before thy memory,<br/><br/>'I feared, loved, hated, suffered, did and died,<br/>And if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit<br/>Had been with purer nutriment supplied,<br/><br/>'Corruption would not now thus much inherit<br/>Of what was once Rousseau,--nor this disguise<br/>Stain that which ought to have disdained to wear it;<br/><br/>'If I have been extinguished, yet there rise<br/>A thousand beacons from the spark I bore'--<br/>'And who are those chained to the car?'--'The wise,<br/><br/>'The great, the unforgotten,--they who wore<br/>Mitres and helms and crowns, or wreaths of light,<br/>Signs of thought's empire over thought--their lore<br/><br/>'Taught them not this, to know themselves; their might<br/>Could not repress the mystery within,<br/>And for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night<br/><br/>'Caught them ere evening.'--'Who is he with chin<br/>Upon his breast, and hands crossed on his chain?'--<br/>'The child of a fierce hour; he sought to win<br/><br/>'The world, and lost all that it did contain<br/>Of greatness, in its hope destroyed; and more<br/>Of fame and peace than virtue's self can gain<br/><br/>'Without the opportunity which bore<br/>Him on its eagle pinions to the peak<br/>From which a thousand climbers have before<br/><br/>'Fallen, as Napoleon fell.'--I felt my cheek<br/>Alter, to see the shadow pass away,<br/>Whose grasp had left the giant world so weak<br/><br/>That every pigmy kicked it as it lay;<br/>And much I grieved to think how power and will<br/>In opposition rule our mortal day,<br/><br/>And why God made irreconcilable<br/>Good and the means of good; and for despair<br/>I half disdained mine eyes' desire to fill<br/><br/>With the spent vision of the times that were<br/>And scarce have ceased to be.--'Dost thou behold,'<br/>Said my guide, 'those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire,<br/><br/>'Frederick, and Paul, Catherine, and Leopold,<br/>And hoary anarchs, demagogues, and sage--<br/>names which the world thinks always old,<br/><br/>'For in the battle Life and they did wage,<br/>She remained conqueror. I was overcome<br/>By my own heart alone, which neither age,<br/><br/>'Nor tears, nor infamy, nor now the tomb<br/>Could temper to its object.'--'Let them pass,'<br/>I cried, 'the world and its mysterious doom<br/><br/>'Is not so much more glorious than it was,<br/>That I desire to worship those who drew<br/>New figures on its false and fragile glass<br/><br/>'As the old faded.'--'Figures ever new<br/>Rise on the bubble, paint them as you may;<br/>We have but thrown, as those before us threw,<br/><br/>'Our shadows on it as it passed away.<br/>But mark how chained to the triumphal chair<br/>The mighty phantoms of an elder day;<br/><br/>'All that is mortal of great Plato there<br/>Expiates the joy and woe his master knew not;<br/>The star that ruled his doom was far too fair.<br/><br/>'And life, where long that flower of Heaven grew not,<br/>Conquered that heart by love, which gold, or pain,<br/>Or age, or sloth, or slavery could subdue not.<br/><br/>'And near him walk the ... twain,<br/>The tutor and his pupil, whom Dominion<br/>Followed as tame as vulture in a chain.<br/><br/>'The world was darkened beneath either pinion<br/>Of him whom from the flock of conquerors<br/>Fame singled out for her thunder-bearing minion;<br/><br/>'The other long outlived both woes and wars,<br/>Throned in the thoughts of men, and still had kept<br/>The jealous key of Truth's eternal doors,<br/><br/>'If Bacon's eagle spirit had not lept<br/>Like lightning out of darkness--he compelled<br/>The Proteus shape of Nature, as it slept<br/><br/>'To wake, and lead him to the caves that held<br/>The treasure of the secrets of its reign.<br/>See the great bards of elder time, who quelled<br/><br/>'The passions which they sung, as by their strain<br/>May well be known: their living melody<br/>Tempers its own contagion to the vein<br/><br/>'Of those who are infected with it--I<br/>Have suffered what I wrote, or viler pain!<br/>And so my words have seeds of misery--<br/><br/>'Even as the deeds of others, not as theirs.'<br/>And then he pointed to a company,<br/><br/>'Midst whom I quickly recognized the heirs<br/>Of Caesar's crime, from him to Constantine;<br/>The anarch chiefs, whose force and murderous snares<br/><br/>Had founded many a sceptre-bearing line,<br/>And spread the plague of gold and blood abroad:<br/>And Gregory and John, and men divine,<br/><br/>Who rose like shadows between man and God;<br/>Till that eclipse, still hanging over heaven,<br/>Was worshipped by the world o'er which they strode,<br/><br/>For the true sun it quenched--'Their power was given<br/>But to destroy,' replied the leader:--'I<br/>Am one of those who have created, even<br/><br/>'If it be but a world of agony.'--<br/>'Whence camest thou? and whither goest thou?<br/>How did thy course begin?' I said, 'and why?<br/><br/>'Mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow<br/>Of people, and my heart sick of one sad thought--<br/>Speak!'--'Whence I am, I partly seem to know,<br/><br/>'And how and by what paths I have been brought<br/>To this dread pass, methinks even thou mayst guess;--<br/>Why this should be, my mind can compass not;<br/><br/>'Whither the conqueror hurries me, still less;--<br/>But follow thou, and from spectator turn<br/>Actor or victim in this wretchedness,<br/><br/>'And what thou wouldst be taught I then may learn<br/>From thee. Now listen:--In the April prime,<br/>When all the forest-tips began to burn<br/><br/>'With kindling green, touched by the azure clime<br/>Of the young season, I was laid asleep<br/>Under a mountain, which from unknown time<br/><br/>'Had yawned into a cavern, high and deep;<br/>And from it came a gentle rivulet,<br/>Whose water, like clear air, in its calm sweep<br/><br/>'Bent the soft grass, and kept for ever wet<br/>The stems of the sweet flowers, and filled the grove<br/>With sounds, which whoso hears must needs forget<br/><br/>'All pleasure and all pain, all hate and love,<br/>Which they had known before that hour of rest;<br/>A sleeping mother then would dream not of<br/><br/>'Her only child who died upon the breast<br/>At eventide--a king would mourn no more<br/>The crown of which his brows were dispossessed<br/><br/>'When the sun lingered o'er his ocean floor<br/>To gild his rival's new prosperity.<br/>'Thou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore<br/><br/>'Ills, which if ills can find no cure from thee,<br/>The thought of which no other sleep will quell,<br/>Nor other music blot from memory,<br/><br/>'So sweet and deep is the oblivious spell;<br/>And whether life had been before that sleep<br/>The Heaven which I imagine, or a Hell<br/><br/>'Like this harsh world in which I woke to weep,<br/>I know not. I arose, and for a space<br/>The scene of woods and waters seemed to keep,<br/><br/>Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace<br/>Of light diviner than the common sun<br/>Sheds on the common earth, and all the place<br/><br/>'Was filled with magic sounds woven into one<br/>Oblivious melody, confusing sense<br/>Amid the gliding waves and shadows dun;<br/><br/>'And, as I looked, the bright omnipresence<br/>Of morning through the orient cavern flowed,<br/>And the sun's image radiantly intense<br/><br/>'Burned on the waters of the well that glowed<br/>Like gold, and threaded all the forest's maze<br/>With winding paths of emerald fire; there stood<br/><br/>'Amid the sun, as he amid the blaze<br/>Of his own glory, on the vibrating<br/>Floor of the fountain, paved with flashing rays,<br/><br/>'A Shape all light, which with one hand did fling<br/>Dew on the earth, as if she were the dawn,<br/>And the invisible rain did ever sing<br/><br/>'A silver music on the mossy lawn;<br/>And still before me on the dusky grass,<br/>Iris her many-coloured scarf had drawn:<br/><br/>'In her right hand she bore a crystal glass,<br/>Mantling with bright Nepenthe; the fierce splendour<br/>Fell from her as she moved under the mass<br/><br/>'Of the deep cavern, and with palms so tender,<br/>Their tread broke not the mirror of its billow,<br/>Glided along the river, and did bend her<br/><br/>'Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow<br/>Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream<br/>That whispered with delight to be its pillow.<br/><br/>'As one enamoured is upborne in dream<br/>O'er lily-paven lakes, mid silver mist<br/>To wondrous music, so this shape might seem<br/><br/>'Partly to tread the waves with feet which kissed<br/>The dancing foam; partly to glide along<br/>The air which roughened the moist amethyst,<br/><br/>'Or the faint morning beams that fell among<br/>The trees, or the soft shadows of the trees;<br/>And her feet, ever to the ceaseless song<br/><br/>'Of leaves, and winds, and waves, and birds, and bees,<br/>And falling drops, moved in a measure new<br/>Yet sweet, as on the summer evening breeze,<br/><br/>'Up from the lake a shape of golden dew<br/>Between two rocks, athwart the rising moon,<br/>Dances i' the wind, where never eagle flew;<br/><br/>'And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune<br/>To which they moved, seemed as they moved to blot<br/>The thoughts of him who gazed on them; and soon<br/><br/>'All that was, seemed as if it had been not;<br/>And all the gazer's mind was strewn beneath<br/>Her feet like embers; and she, thought by thought,<br/><br/>'Trampled its sparks into the dust of death<br/>As day upon the threshold of the east<br/>Treads out the lamps of night, until the breath<br/><br/>'Of darkness re-illumine even the least<br/>Of heaven's living eyes--like day she came,<br/>Making the night a dream; and ere she ceased<br/><br/>'To move, as one between desire and shame<br/>Suspended, I said--If, as it doth seem,<br/>Thou comest from the realm without a name<br/><br/>'Into this valley of perpetual dream,<br/>Show whence I came, and where I am, and why--<br/>Pass not away upon the passing stream.<br/><br/>'Arise and quench thy thirst, was her reply.<br/>And as a shut lily stricken by the wand<br/>Of dewy morning's vital alchemy,<br/><br/>'I rose; and, bending at her sweet command,<br/>Touched with faint lips the cup she raised,<br/>And suddenly my brain became as sand<br/><br/>'Where the first wave had more than half erased<br/>The track of deer on desert Labrador;<br/>Whilst the wolf, from which they fled amazed,<br/><br/>'Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore,<br/>Until the second bursts;--so on my sight<br/>Burst a new vision, never seen before,<br/><br/>'And the fair shape waned in the coming light,<br/>As veil by veil the silent splendour drops<br/>From Lucifer, amid the chrysolite<br/><br/>'Of sunrise, ere it tinge the mountain-tops;<br/>And as the presence of that fairest planet,<br/>Although unseen, is felt by one who hopes<br/><br/>'That his day's path may end as he began it,<br/>In that star's smile, whose light is like the scent<br/>Of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it,<br/><br/>'Or the soft note in which his dear lament<br/>The Brescian shepherd breathes, or the caress<br/>That turned his weary slumber to content;<br/><br/>'So knew I in that light's severe excess<br/>The presence of that Shape which on the stream<br/>Moved, as I moved along the wilderness,<br/><br/>'More dimly than a day-appearing dream,<br/>The host of a forgotten form of sleep;<br/>A light of heaven, whose half-extinguished beam<br/><br/>'Through the sick day in which we wake to weep<br/>Glimmers, for ever sought, for ever lost;<br/>So did that shape its obscure tenour keep<br/><br/>'Beside my path, as silent as a ghost;<br/>But the new Vision, and the cold bright car,<br/>With solemn speed and stunning music, crossed<br/><br/>'The forest, and as if from some dread war<br/>Triumphantly returning, the loud million<br/>Fiercely extolled the fortune of her star.<br/><br/>'A moving arch of victory, the vermilion<br/>And green and azure plumes of Iris had<br/>Built high over her wind-winged pavilion,<br/><br/>'And underneath aethereal glory clad<br/>The wilderness, and far before her flew<br/>The tempest of the splendour, which forbade<br/><br/>'Shadow to fall from leaf and stone; the crew<br/>Seemed in that light, like atomies to dance<br/>Within a sunbeam;--some upon the new<br/><br/>'Embroidery of flowers, that did enhance<br/>The grassy vesture of the desert, played,<br/>Forgetful of the chariot's swift advance;<br/><br/>'Others stood gazing, till within the shade<br/>Of the great mountain its light left them dim;<br/>Others outspeeded it; and others made<br/><br/>'Circles around it, like the clouds that swim<br/>Round the high moon in a bright sea of air;<br/>And more did follow, with exulting hymn,<br/><br/>'The chariot and the captives fettered there:--<br/>But all like bubbles on an eddying flood<br/>Fell into the same track at last, and were<br/><br/>'Borne onward.--I among the multitude<br/>Was swept--me, sweetest flowers delayed not long;<br/>Me, not the shadow nor the solitude;<br/><br/>'Me, not that falling stream's Lethean song;<br/>Me, not the phantom of that early Form<br/>Which moved upon its motion--but among<br/><br/>'The thickest billows of that living storm<br/>I plunged, and bared my bosom to the clime<br/>Of that cold light, whose airs too soon deform.<br/><br/>'Before the chariot had begun to climb<br/>The opposing steep of that mysterious dell,<br/>Behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme<br/><br/>'Of him who from the lowest depths of hell,<br/>Through every paradise and through all glory,<br/>Love led serene, and who returned to tell<br/><br/>'The words of hate and awe; the wondrous story<br/>How all things are transfigured except Love;<br/>For deaf as is a sea, which wrath makes hoary,<br/><br/>'The world can hear not the sweet notes that move<br/>The sphere whose light is melody to lovers--<br/>A wonder worthy of his rhyme.--The grove<br/><br/>'Grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers,<br/>The earth was gray with phantoms, and the air<br/>Was peopled with dim forms, as when there hovers<br/><br/>'A flock of vampire-bats before the glare<br/>Of the tropic sun, bringing, ere evening,<br/>Strange night upon some Indian isle;--thus were<br/><br/>'Phantoms diffused around; and some did fling<br/>Shadows of shadows, yet unlike themselves,<br/>Behind them; some like eaglets on the wing<br/><br/>'Were lost in the white day; others like elves<br/>Danced in a thousand unimagined shapes<br/>Upon the sunny streams and grassy shelves;<br/><br/>'And others sate chattering like restless apes<br/>On vulgar hands,...<br/>Some made a cradle of the ermined capes<br/><br/>'Of kingly mantles; some across the tiar<br/>Of pontiffs sate like vultures; others played<br/>Under the crown which girt with empire<br/><br/>'A baby's or an idiot's brow, and made<br/>Their nests in it. The old anatomies<br/>Sate hatching their bare broods under the shade<br/><br/>'Of daemon wings, and laughed from their dead eyes<br/>To reassume the delegated power,<br/>Arrayed in which those worms did monarchize,<br/><br/>'Who made this earth their charnel. Others more<br/>Humble, like falcons, sate upon the fist<br/>Of common men, and round their heads did soar;<br/><br/>Or like small gnats and flies, as thick as mist<br/>On evening marshes, thronged about the brow<br/>Of lawyers, statesmen, priest and theorist;--<br/><br/>'And others, like discoloured flakes of snow<br/>On fairest bosoms and the sunniest hair,<br/>Fell, and were melted by the youthful glow<br/><br/>'Which they extinguished; and, like tears, they were<br/>A veil to those from whose faint lids they rained<br/>In drops of sorrow. I became aware<br/><br/>'Of whence those forms proceeded which thus stained<br/>The track in which we moved. After brief space,<br/>From every form the beauty slowly waned;<br/><br/>'From every firmest limb and fairest face<br/>The strength and freshness fell like dust, and left<br/>The action and the shape without the grace<br/><br/>'Of life. The marble brow of youth was cleft<br/>With care; and in those eyes where once hope shone,<br/>Desire, like a lioness bereft<br/><br/>'Of her last cub, glared ere it died; each one<br/>Of that great crowd sent forth incessantly<br/>These shadows, numerous as the dead leaves blown<br/><br/>'In autumn evening from a poplar tree.<br/>Each like himself and like each other were<br/>At first; but some distorted seemed to be<br/><br/>'Obscure clouds, moulded by the casual air;<br/>And of this stuff the car's creative ray<br/>Wrought all the busy phantoms that were there,<br/><br/>'As the sun shapes the clouds; thus on the way<br/>Mask after mask fell from the countenance<br/>And form of all; and long before the day<br/><br/>'Was old, the joy which waked like heaven's glance<br/>The sleepers in the oblivious valley, died;<br/>And some grew weary of the ghastly dance,<br/><br/>'And fell, as I have fallen, by the wayside;--<br/>Those soonest from whose forms most shadows passed,<br/>And least of strength and beauty did abide.<br/><br/>'Then, what is life? I cried.'--<br/><br/>STANZA, WRITTEN AT BRACKNELL.<br/><br/>Thy dewy looks sink in my breast;<br/>Thy gentle words stir poison there;<br/>Thou hast disturbed the only rest<br/>That was the portion of despair!<br/>Subdued to Duty's hard control,<br/>I could have borne my wayward lot:<br/>The chains that bind this ruined soul<br/>Had cankered then--but crushed it not.<br/><br/>STANZAS.--APRIL, 1814.<br/><br/>Away! the moor is dark beneath the moon,<br/>Rapid clouds have drank the last pale beam of even:<br/>Away! the gathering winds will call the darkness soon,<br/>And profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven.<br/><br/>Pause not! The time is past! Every voice cries, Away!<br/>Tempt not with one last tear thy friend's ungentle mood:<br/>Thy lover's eye, so glazed and cold, dares not entreat thy stay:<br/>Duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude.<br/><br/>Away, away! to thy sad and silent home;<br/>Pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth;<br/>Watch the dim shades as like ghosts they go and come,<br/>And complicate strange webs of melancholy mirth.<br/><br/>The leaves of wasted autumn woods shall float around thine head:<br/>The blooms of dewy spring shall gleam beneath thy feet:<br/>But thy soul or this world must fade in the frost that binds the dead,<br/>Ere midnight's frown and morning's smile, ere thou and peace may meet.<br/><br/>The cloud shadows of midnight possess their own repose,<br/>For the weary winds are silent, or the moon is in the deep:<br/>Some respite to its turbulence unresting ocean knows;<br/>Whatever moves, or toils, or grieves, hath its appointed sleep.<br/><br/>Thou in the grave shalt rest--yet till the phantoms flee<br/>Which that house and heath and garden made dear to thee erewhile,<br/>Thy remembrance, and repentance, and deep musings are not free<br/>From the music of two voices and the light of one sweet smile.
