# üíÆ The Prophecy of Dante by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
         "'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,<br/>      And coming events cast their shadows before."<br/><br/>                        Campbell, .<br/><br/>DEDICATION.<br/><br/>Lady! if for the cold and cloudy clime<br/>  Where I was born, but where I would not die,<br/>  Of the great Poet-Sire of Italy<br/>I dare to build the imitative rhyme,<br/>Harsh Runic copy of the South's sublime,<br/>  Thou art the cause; and howsoever I<br/>  Fall short of his immortal harmony,<br/>Thy gentle heart will pardon me the crime.<br/>Thou, in the pride of Beauty and of Youth,<br/>   Spakest; and for thee to speak and be obeyed<br/>Are one; but only in the sunny South<br/>  Such sounds are uttered, and such charms displayed,<br/>So sweet a language from so fair a mouth--<br/>  Ah! to what effort would it not persuade?<br/><br/>CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>Once more in Man's frail world! which I had left<br/>  So long that 'twas forgotten; and I feel<br/>  The weight of clay again,--too soon bereft<br/>Of the Immortal Vision which could heal<br/>  My earthly sorrows, and to God's own skies<br/>  Lift me from that deep Gulf without repeal,<br/>Where late my ears rung with the damned cries<br/>  Of Souls in hopeless bale; and from that place<br/>  Of lesser torment, whence men may arise<br/>Pure from the fire to join the Angelic race;<br/>  Midst whom my own bright Beatricƒì blessed<br/>  My spirit with her light; and to the base<br/>Of the Eternal Triad! first, last, best,<br/>  Mysterious, three, sole, infinite, great God!<br/>  Soul universal! led the mortal guest,<br/>Unblasted by the Glory, though he trod<br/>  From star to star to reach the almighty throne.<br/>  Oh Beatrice! whose sweet limbs the sod<br/>So long hath pressed, and the cold marble stone,<br/>  Thou sole pure Seraph of my earliest love,<br/>  Love so ineffable, and so alone,<br/>That nought on earth could more my bosom move,<br/>  And meeting thee in Heaven was but to meet<br/>  That without which my Soul, like the arkless dove,<br/>Had wandered still in search of, nor her feet<br/>  Relieved her wing till found; without thy light<br/>  My Paradise had still been incomplete.<br/>Since my tenth sun gave summer to my sight<br/>  Thou wert my Life, the Essence of my thought,<br/>  Loved ere I knew the name of Love, and bright<br/>Still in these dim old eyes, now overwrought<br/>  With the World's war, and years, and banishment,<br/>  And tears for thee, by other woes untaught;<br/>For mine is not a nature to be bent<br/>  By tyrannous faction, and the brawling crowd,<br/>  And though the long, long conflict hath been spent<br/>In vain,--and never more, save when the cloud<br/>  Which overhangs the Apennine my mind's eye<br/>  Pierces to fancy Florence, once so proud<br/>Of me, can I return, though but to die,<br/>  Unto my native soil,--they have not yet<br/>  Quenched the old exile's spirit, stern and high.<br/>But the Sun, though not overcast, must set<br/>  And the night cometh; I am old in days,<br/>  And deeds, and contemplation, and have met<br/>Destruction face to face in all his ways.<br/>  The World hath left me, what it found me, pure,<br/>  And if I have not gathered yet its praise,<br/>I sought it not by any baser lure;<br/>  Man wrongs, and Time avenges, and my name<br/>  May form a monument not all obscure,<br/>Though such was not my Ambition's end or aim,<br/>  To add to the vain-glorious list of those<br/>  Who dabble in the pettiness of fame,<br/>And make men's fickle breath the wind that blows<br/>  Their sail, and deem it glory to be classed<br/>  With conquerors, and Virtue's other foes,<br/>In bloody chronicles of ages past.<br/>  I would have had my Florence great and free;<br/>  Oh Florence! Florence! unto me thou wast<br/>Like that Jerusalem which the Almighty He<br/>  Wept over, "but thou wouldst not;" as the bird<br/>  Gathers its young, I would have gathered thee<br/>Beneath a parent pinion, hadst thou heard<br/>  My voice; but as the adder, deaf and fierce,<br/>  Against the breast that cherished thee was stirred<br/>Thy venom, and my state thou didst amerce,<br/>  And doom this body forfeit to the fire.<br/>  Alas! how bitter is his country's curse<br/>To him who _for_ that country would expire,<br/>  But did not merit to expire _by_ her,<br/>  And loves her, loves her even in her ire.<br/>The day may come when she will cease to err,<br/>  The day may come she would be proud to have<br/>  The dust she dooms to scatter, and transfer<br/>Of him, whom she denied a home, the grave.<br/>  But this shall not be granted; let my dust<br/>  Lie where it falls; nor shall the soil which gave<br/>Me breath, but in her sudden fury thrust<br/>  Me forth to breathe elsewhere, so reassume<br/>  My indignant bones, because her angry gust<br/>Forsooth is over, and repealed her doom;<br/>  No,--she denied me what was mine--my roof,<br/>  And shall not have what is not hers--my tomb.<br/>Too long her arm√©d wrath hath kept aloof<br/>  The breast which would have bled for her, the heart<br/>  That beat, the mind that was temptation proof,<br/>The man who fought, toiled, travelled, and each part<br/>  Of a true citizen fulfilled, and saw<br/>  For his reward the Guelf's ascendant art<br/>Pass his destruction even into a law.<br/>  These things are not made for forgetfulness,<br/>  Florence shall be forgotten first; too raw<br/>The wound, too deep the wrong, and the distress<br/>  Of such endurance too prolonged to make<br/>  My pardon greater, her injustice less,<br/>Though late repented; yet--yet for her sake<br/>  I feel some fonder yearnings, and for thine,<br/>  My own Beatricƒì, I would hardly take<br/>Vengeance upon the land which once was mine,<br/>  And still is hallowed by thy dust's return,<br/>  Which would protect the murderess like a shrine,<br/>And save ten thousand foes by thy sole urn.<br/>  Though, like old Marius from Minturn√¶'s marsh<br/>  And Carthage ruins, my lone breast may burn<br/>At times with evil feelings hot and harsh,<br/>  And sometimes the last pangs of a vile foe<br/>  Writhe in a dream before me, and o'erarch<br/>My brow with hopes of triumph,--let them go!<br/>  Such are the last infirmities of those<br/>  Who long have suffered more than mortal woe,<br/>And yet being mortal still, have no repose<br/>  But on the pillow of Revenge--Revenge,<br/>  Who sleeps to dream of blood, and waking glows<br/>With the oft-baffled, slakeless thirst of change,<br/>  When we shall mount again, and they that trod<br/>  Be trampled on, while Death and At√© range<br/>O'er humbled heads and severed necks----Great God!<br/>  Take these thoughts from me--to thy hands I yield<br/>  My many wrongs, and thine Almighty rod<br/>Will fall on those who smote me,--be my Shield!<br/>  As thou hast been in peril, and in pain,<br/>  In turbulent cities, and the tented field--<br/>In toil, and many troubles borne in vain<br/>  For Florence,--I appeal from her to Thee!<br/>  Thee, whom I late saw in thy loftiest reign,<br/>Even in that glorious Vision, which to see<br/>  And live was never granted until now,<br/>  And yet thou hast permitted this to me.<br/>Alas! with what a weight upon my brow<br/>  The sense of earth and earthly things come back,<br/>  Corrosive passions, feelings dull and low,<br/>The heart's quick throb upon the mental rack,<br/>  Long day, and dreary night; the retrospect<br/>  Of half a century bloody and black,<br/>And the frail few years I may yet expect<br/>  Hoary and hopeless, but less hard to bear,<br/>  For I have been too long and deeply wrecked<br/>On the lone rock of desolate Despair,<br/>  To lift my eyes more to the passing sail<br/>  Which shuns that reef so horrible and bare;<br/>Nor raise my voice--for who would heed my wail?<br/>  I am not of this people, nor this age,<br/>  And yet my harpings will unfold a tale<br/>Which shall preserve these times when not a page<br/>  Of their perturb√©d annals could attract<br/>  An eye to gaze upon their civil rage,<br/>Did not my verse embalm full many an act<br/>  Worthless as they who wrought it: 'tis the doom<br/>  Of spirits of my order to be racked<br/>In life, to wear their hearts out, and consume<br/>  Their days in endless strife, and die alone;<br/>  Then future thousands crowd around their tomb,<br/>And pilgrims come from climes where they have known<br/>  The name of him--who now is but a name,<br/>  And wasting homage o'er the sullen stone,<br/>Spread his--by him unheard, unheeded--fame;<br/>  And mine at least hath cost me dear: to die<br/>  Is nothing; but to wither thus--to tame<br/>My mind down from its own infinity--<br/>  To live in narrow ways with little men,<br/>  A common sight to every common eye,<br/>A wanderer, while even wolves can find a den,<br/>  Ripped from all kindred, from all home, all things<br/>  That make communion sweet, and soften pain--<br/>To feel me in the solitude of kings<br/>  Without the power that makes them bear a crown--<br/>  To envy every dove his nest and wings<br/>Which waft him where the Apennine looks down<br/>  On Arno, till he perches, it may be,<br/>  Within my all inexorable town,<br/>Where yet my boys are, and that fatal She,<br/>  Their mother, the cold partner who hath brought<br/>  Destruction for a dowry--this to see<br/>And feel, and know without repair, hath taught<br/>  A bitter lesson; but it leaves me free:<br/>  I have not vilely found, nor basely sought,<br/>They made an Exile--not a Slave of me.<br/><br/>CANTO THE SECOND.<br/><br/>The Spirit of the fervent days of Old,<br/>  When words were things that came to pass, and Thought<br/>  Flashed o'er the future, bidding men behold<br/>Their children's children's doom already brought<br/>  Forth from the abyss of Time which is to be,<br/>  The Chaos of events, where lie half-wrought<br/>Shapes that must undergo mortality;<br/>  What the great Seers of Israel wore within,<br/>  That Spirit was on them, and is on me,<br/>And if, Cassandra-like, amidst the din<br/>  Of conflict none will hear, or hearing heed<br/>  This voice from out the Wilderness, the sin<br/>Be theirs, and my own feelings be my meed,<br/>  The only guerdon I have ever known.<br/>  Hast thou not bled? and hast thou still to bleed,<br/>Italia? Ah! to me such things, foreshown<br/>  With dim sepulchral light, bid me forget<br/>  In thine irreparable wrongs my own;<br/>We can have but one Country, and even yet<br/>  Thou'rt mine--my bones shall be within thy breast,<br/>  My Soul within thy language, which once set<br/>With our old Roman sway in the wide West;<br/>  But I will make another tongue arise<br/>  As lofty and more sweet, in which expressed<br/>The hero's ardour, or the lover's sighs,<br/>  Shall find alike such sounds for every theme<br/>  That every word, as brilliant as thy skies,<br/>Shall realise a Poet's proudest dream,<br/>  And make thee Europe's Nightingale of Song;<br/>  So that all present speech to thine shall seem<br/>The note of meaner birds, and every tongue<br/>  Confess its barbarism when compared with thine.<br/>  This shalt thou owe to him thou didst so wrong,<br/>Thy Tuscan bard, the banished Ghibelline.<br/>  Woe! woe! the veil of coming centuries<br/>  Is rent,--a thousand years which yet supine<br/>Lie like the ocean waves ere winds arise,<br/>  Heaving in dark and sullen undulation,<br/>  Float from Eternity into these eyes;<br/>The storms yet sleep, the clouds still keep their station,<br/>  The unborn Earthquake yet is in the womb,<br/>  The bloody Chaos yet expects Creation,<br/>But all things are disposing for thy doom;<br/>  The Elements await but for the Word,<br/>  "Let there be darkness!" and thou grow'st a tomb!<br/>Yes! thou, so beautiful, shalt feel the sword,<br/>  Thou, Italy! so fair that Paradise,<br/>  Revived in thee, blooms forth to man restored:<br/>Ah! must the sons of Adam lose it twice?<br/>  Thou, Italy! whose ever golden fields,<br/>  Ploughed by the sunbeams solely, would suffice<br/>For the world's granary; thou, whose sky Heaven gilds<br/>  With brighter stars, and robes with deeper blue;<br/>  Thou, in whose pleasant places Summer builds<br/>Her palace, in whose cradle Empire grew,<br/>  And formed the Eternal City's ornaments<br/>  From spoils of Kings whom freemen overthrew;<br/>Birthplace of heroes, sanctuary of Saints,<br/>  Where earthly first, then heavenly glory made<br/>  Her home; thou, all which fondest Fancy paints,<br/>And finds her prior vision but portrayed<br/>  In feeble colours, when the eye--from the Alp<br/>  Of horrid snow, and rock, and shaggy shade<br/>Of desert-loving pine, whose emerald scalp<br/>  Nods to the storm--dilates and dotes o'er thee,<br/>  And wistfully implores, as 'twere, for help<br/>To see thy sunny fields, my Italy,<br/>  Nearer and nearer yet, and dearer still<br/>  The more approached, and dearest were they free,<br/>Thou--Thou must wither to each tyrant's will:<br/>  The Goth hath been,--the German, Frank, and Hun<br/>  Are yet to come,--and on the imperial hill<br/>Ruin, already proud of the deeds done<br/>  By the old barbarians, there awaits the new,<br/>  Throned on the Palatine, while lost and won<br/>Rome at her feet lies bleeding; and the hue<br/>  Of human sacrifice and Roman slaughter<br/>  Troubles the clotted air, of late so blue,<br/>And deepens into red the saffron water<br/>  Of Tiber, thick with dead; the helpless priest,<br/>  And still more helpless nor less holy daughter,<br/>Vowed to their God, have shrieking fled, and ceased<br/>  Their ministry: the nations take their prey,<br/>  Iberian, Almain, Lombard, and the beast<br/>And bird, wolf, vulture, more humane than they<br/>  Are; these but gorge the flesh, and lap the gore<br/>  Of the departed, and then go their way;<br/>But those, the human savages, explore<br/>  All paths of torture, and insatiate yet,<br/>  With Ugolino hunger prowl for more.<br/>Nine moons shall rise o'er scenes like this and set;<br/>  The chiefless army of the dead, which late<br/>  Beneath the traitor Prince's banner met,<br/>Hath left its leader's ashes at the gate;<br/>  Had but the royal Rebel lived, perchance<br/>  Thou hadst been spared, but his involved thy fate.<br/>Oh! Rome, the Spoiler or the spoil of France,<br/>  From Brennus to the Bourbon, never, never<br/>  Shall foreign standard to thy walls advance,<br/>But Tiber shall become a mournful river.<br/>  Oh! when the strangers pass the Alps and Po,<br/>  Crush them, ye Rocks! Floods whelm them, and for ever!<br/>Why sleep the idle Avalanches so,<br/>  To topple on the lonely pilgrim's head?<br/>  Why doth Eridanus but overflow<br/>The peasant's harvest from his turbid bed?<br/>  Were not each barbarous horde a nobler prey?<br/>  Over Cambyses' host the desert spread<br/>Her sandy ocean, and the Sea-waves' sway<br/>  Rolled over Pharaoh and his thousands,--why,<br/>  Mountains and waters, do ye not as they?<br/>And you, ye Men! Romans, who dare not die,<br/>  Sons of the conquerors who overthrew<br/>  Those who overthrew proud Xerxes, where yet lie<br/>The dead whose tomb Oblivion never knew,<br/>  Are the Alps weaker than Thermopyl√¶?<br/>  Their passes more alluring to the view<br/>Of an invader? is it they, or ye,<br/>  That to each host the mountain-gate unbar,<br/>  And leave the march in peace, the passage free?<br/>Why, Nature's self detains the Victor's car,<br/>  And makes your land impregnable, if earth<br/>  Could be so; but alone she will not war,<br/>Yet aids the warrior worthy of his birth<br/>  In a soil where the mothers bring forth men:<br/>  Not so with those whose souls are little worth;<br/>For them no fortress can avail,--the den<br/>  Of the poor reptile which preserves its sting<br/>  Is more secure than walls of adamant, when<br/>The hearts of those within are quivering.<br/>  Are ye not brave? Yes, yet the Ausonian soil<br/>  Hath hearts, and hands, and arms, and hosts to bring<br/>Against Oppression; but how vain the toil,<br/>  While still Division sows the seeds of woe<br/>  And weakness, till the Stranger reaps the spoil.<br/>Oh! my own beauteous land! so long laid low,<br/>  So long the grave of thy own children's hopes,<br/>  When there is but required a single blow<br/>To break the chain, yet--yet the Avenger stops,<br/>  And Doubt and Discord step 'twixt thine and thee,<br/>  And join their strength to that which with thee copes;<br/>What is there wanting then to set thee free,<br/>  And show thy beauty in its fullest light?<br/>  To make the Alps impassable; and we,<br/>Her Sons, may do this with one deed--Unite.<br/><br/>CANTO THE THIRD.<br/><br/>From out the mass of never-dying ill,<br/>  The Plague, the Prince, the Stranger, and the Sword,<br/>  Vials of wrath but emptied to refill<br/>And flow again, I cannot all record<br/>  That crowds on my prophetic eye: the Earth<br/>  And Ocean written o'er would not afford<br/>Space for the annal, yet it shall go forth;<br/>  Yes, all, though not by human pen, is graven,<br/>  There where the farthest suns and stars have birth,<br/>Spread like a banner at the gate of Heaven,<br/>  The bloody scroll of our millennial wrongs<br/>  Waves, and the echo of our groans is driven<br/>Athwart the sound of archangelic songs,<br/>  And Italy, the martyred nation's gore,<br/>  Will not in vain arise to where belongs<br/>Omnipotence and Mercy evermore:<br/>  Like to a harpstring stricken by the wind,<br/>  The sound of her lament shall, rising o'er<br/>The Seraph voices, touch the Almighty Mind.<br/>  Meantime I, humblest of thy sons, and of<br/>  Earth's dust by immortality refined<br/>To Sense and Suffering, though the vain may scoff,<br/>  And tyrants threat, and meeker victims bow<br/>  Before the storm because its breath is rough,<br/>To thee, my Country! whom before, as now,<br/>  I loved and love, devote the mournful lyre<br/>  And melancholy gift high Powers allow<br/>To read the future: and if now my fire<br/>  Is not as once it shone o'er thee, forgive!<br/>  I but foretell thy fortunes--then expire;<br/>Think not that I would look on them and live.<br/>  A Spirit forces me to see and speak,<br/>  And for my guerdon grants _not_ to survive;<br/>My Heart shall be poured over thee and break:<br/>  Yet for a moment, ere I must resume<br/>  Thy sable web of Sorrow, let me take<br/>Over the gleams that flash athwart thy gloom<br/>  A softer glimpse; some stars shine through thy night,<br/>  And many meteors, and above thy tomb<br/>Leans sculptured Beauty, which Death cannot blight:<br/>  And from thine ashes boundless Spirits rise<br/>  To give thee honour, and the earth delight;<br/>Thy soil shall still be pregnant with the wise,<br/>  The gay, the learned, the generous, and the brave,<br/>  Native to thee as Summer to thy skies,<br/>Conquerors on foreign shores, and the far wave,<br/>  Discoverers of new worlds, which take their name;<br/>  For _thee_ alone they have no arm to save,<br/>And all thy recompense is in their fame,<br/>  A noble one to them, but not to thee--<br/>  Shall they be glorious, and thou still the same?<br/>Oh! more than these illustrious far shall be<br/>  The Being--and even yet he may be born--<br/>  The mortal Saviour who shall set thee free,<br/>And see thy diadem, so changed and worn<br/>  By fresh barbarians, on thy brow replaced;<br/>  And the sweet Sun replenishing thy morn,<br/>Thy moral morn, too long with clouds defaced,<br/>  And noxious vapours from Avernus risen,<br/>  Such as all they must breathe who are debased<br/>By Servitude, and have the mind in prison.<br/>  Yet through this centuried eclipse of woe<br/>  Some voices shall be heard, and Earth shall listen;<br/>Poets shall follow in the path I show,<br/>  And make it broader: the same brilliant sky<br/>  Which cheers the birds to song shall bid them glow,<br/>And raise their notes as natural and high;<br/>  Tuneful shall be their numbers; they shall sing<br/>  Many of Love, and some of Liberty,<br/>But few shall soar upon that Eagle's wing,<br/>  And look in the Sun's face, with Eagle's gaze,<br/>  All free and fearless as the feathered King,<br/>But fly more near the earth; how many a phrase<br/>  Sublime shall lavished be on some small prince<br/>  In all the prodigality of Praise!<br/>And language, eloquently false, evince<br/>  The harlotry of Genius, which, like Beauty,<br/>  Too oft forgets its own self-reverence,<br/>And looks on prostitution as a duty.<br/>  He who once enters in a Tyrant's hall<br/>  As guest is slave--his thoughts become a booty,<br/>And the first day which sees the chain enthral<br/>  A captive, sees his half of Manhood gone--<br/>  The Soul's emasculation saddens all<br/>His spirit; thus the Bard too near the throne<br/>  Quails from his inspiration, bound to _please_,--<br/>  How servile is the task to please alone!<br/>To smooth the verse to suit his Sovereign's ease<br/>  And royal leisure, nor too much prolong<br/>  Aught save his eulogy, and find, and seize,<br/>Or force, or forge fit argument of Song!<br/>  Thus trammelled, thus condemned to Flattery's trebles,<br/>  He toils through all, still trembling to be wrong:<br/>For fear some noble thoughts, like heavenly rebels,<br/>  Should rise up in high treason to his brain,<br/>  He sings, as the Athenian spoke, with pebbles<br/>In's mouth, lest Truth should stammer through his strain.<br/>  But out of the long file of sonneteers<br/>  There shall be some who will not sing in vain,<br/>And he, their Prince, shall rank among my peers,<br/>  And Love shall be his torment; but his grief<br/>  Shall make an immortality of tears,<br/>And Italy shall hail him as the Chief<br/>  Of Poet-lovers, and his higher song<br/>  Of Freedom wreathe him with as green a leaf.<br/>But in a farther age shall rise along<br/>  The banks of Po two greater still than he;<br/>  The World which smiled on him shall do them wrong<br/>Till they are ashes, and repose with me.<br/>  The first will make an epoch with his lyre,<br/>  And fill the earth with feats of Chivalry:<br/>His Fancy like a rainbow, and his Fire,<br/>  Like that of Heaven, immortal, and his Thought<br/>  Borne onward with a wing that cannot tire;<br/>Pleasure shall, like a butterfly new caught,<br/>  Flutter her lovely pinions o'er his theme,<br/>  And Art itself seem into Nature wrought<br/>By the transparency of his bright dream.--<br/>  The second, of a tenderer, sadder mood,<br/>  Shall pour his soul out o'er Jerusalem;<br/>He, too, shall sing of Arms, and Christian blood<br/>  Shed where Christ bled for man; and his high harp<br/>  Shall, by the willow over Jordan's flood,<br/>Revive a song of Sion, and the sharp<br/>  Conflict, and final triumph of the brave<br/>  And pious, and the strife of Hell to warp<br/>Their hearts from their great purpose, until wave<br/>  The red-cross banners where the first red Cross<br/>  Was crimsoned from His veins who died to save,<br/>Shall be his sacred argument; the loss<br/>  Of years, of favour, freedom, even of fame<br/>  Contested for a time, while the smooth gloss<br/>Of Courts would slide o'er his forgotten name<br/>  And call Captivity a kindness--meant<br/>  To shield him from insanity or shame--<br/>Such shall be his meek guerdon! who was sent<br/>  To be Christ's Laureate--they reward him well!<br/>  Florence dooms me but death or banishment,<br/>Ferrara him a pittance and a cell,<br/>  Harder to bear and less deserved, for I<br/>  Had stung the factions which I strove to quell;<br/>But this meek man who with a lover's eye<br/>  Will look on Earth and Heaven, and who will deign<br/>  To embalm with his celestial flattery,<br/>As poor a thing as e'er was spawned to reign,<br/>  What will _he_ do to merit such a doom?<br/>  Perhaps he'll _love_,--and is not Love in vain<br/>Torture enough without a living tomb?<br/>  Yet it will be so--he and his compeer,<br/>  The Bard of Chivalry, will both consume<br/>In penury and pain too many a year,<br/>  And, dying in despondency, bequeath<br/>  To the kind World, which scarce will yield a tear,<br/>A heritage enriching all who breathe<br/>  With the wealth of a genuine Poet's soul,<br/>  And to their country a redoubled wreath,<br/>Unmatched by time; not Hellas can unroll<br/>  Through her Olympiads two such names, though one<br/>  Of hers be mighty;--and is this the whole<br/>Of such men's destiny beneath the Sun?<br/>  Must all the finer thoughts, the thrilling sense,<br/>  The electric blood with which their arteries run,<br/>Their body's self turned soul with the intense<br/>  Feeling of that which is, and fancy of<br/>  That which should be, to such a recompense<br/>Conduct? shall their bright plumage on the rough<br/>  Storm be still scattered? Yes, and it must be;<br/>  For, formed of far too penetrable stuff,<br/>These birds of Paradise but long to flee<br/>  Back to their native mansion, soon they find<br/>  Earth's mist with their pure pinions not agree,<br/>And die or are degraded; for the mind<br/>  Succumbs to long infection, and despair,<br/>  And vulture Passions flying close behind,<br/>Await the moment to assail and tear;<br/>  And when, at length, the wing√©d wanderers stoop,<br/>  Then is the Prey-birds' triumph, then they share<br/>The spoil, o'erpowered at length by one fell swoop.<br/>  Yet some have been untouched who learned to bear,<br/>  Some whom no Power could ever force to droop,<br/>Who could resist themselves even, hardest care!<br/>  And task most hopeless; but some such have been,<br/>  And if my name amongst the number were,<br/>That Destiny austere, and yet serene,<br/>  Were prouder than more dazzling fame unblessed;<br/>  The Alp's snow summit nearer heaven is seen<br/>Than the Volcano's fierce eruptive crest,<br/>  Whose splendour from the black abyss is flung,<br/>  While the scorched mountain, from whose burning breast<br/>A temporary torturing flame is wrung,<br/>  Shines for a night of terror, then repels<br/>  Its fire back to the Hell from whence it sprung,<br/>The Hell which in its entrails ever dwells.<br/><br/>CANTO THE FOURTH.<br/><br/>Many are Poets who have never penned<br/>  Their inspiration, and perchance the best:<br/>  They felt, and loved, and died, but would not lend<br/>Their thoughts to meaner beings; they compressed<br/>  The God within them, and rejoined the stars<br/>  Unlaurelled upon earth, but far more blessed<br/>Than those who are degraded by the jars<br/>  Of Passion, and their frailties linked to fame,<br/>  Conquerors of high renown, but full of scars.<br/>Many are Poets but without the name;<br/>  For what is Poesy but to create<br/>  From overfeeling Good or Ill; and aim<br/>At an external life beyond our fate,<br/>  And be the new Prometheus of new men,<br/>  Bestowing fire from Heaven, and then, too late,<br/>Finding the pleasure given repaid with pain,<br/>  And vultures to the heart of the bestower,<br/>  Who, having lavished his high gift in vain,<br/>Lies to his lone rock by the sea-shore?<br/>  So be it: we can bear.--But thus all they<br/>  Whose Intellect is an o'ermastering Power<br/>Which still recoils from its encumbering clay<br/>  Or lightens it to spirit, whatsoe'er<br/>  The form which their creations may essay,<br/>Are bards; the kindled Marble's bust may wear<br/>  More poesy upon its speaking brow<br/>  Than aught less than the Homeric page may bear;<br/>One noble stroke with a whole life may glow,<br/>  Or deify the canvass till it shine<br/>  With beauty so surpassing all below,<br/>That they who kneel to Idols so divine<br/>  Break no commandment, for high Heaven is there<br/>  Transfused, transfigurated: and the line<br/>Of Poesy, which peoples but the air<br/>  With Thought and Beings of our thought reflected,<br/>  Can do no more: then let the artist share<br/>The palm, he shares the peril, and dejected<br/>  Faints o'er the labour unapproved--Alas!<br/>  Despair and Genius are too oft connected.<br/>Within the ages which before me pass<br/>  Art shall resume and equal even the sway<br/>  Which with Apelles and old Phidias<br/>She held in Hellas' unforgotten day.<br/>  Ye shall be taught by Ruin to revive<br/>  The Grecian forms at least from their decay,<br/>And Roman souls at last again shall live<br/>  In Roman works wrought by Italian hands,<br/>  And temples, loftier than the old temples, give<br/>New wonders to the World; and while still stands<br/>  The austere Pantheon, into heaven shall soar<br/>  A Dome, its image, while the base expands<br/>Into a fane surpassing all before,<br/>  Such as all flesh shall flock to kneel in: ne'er<br/>  Such sight hath been unfolded by a door<br/>As this, to which all nations shall repair,<br/>  And lay their sins at this huge gate of Heaven.<br/>  And the bold Architect unto whose care<br/>The daring charge to raise it shall be given,<br/>  Whom all Arts shall acknowledge as their Lord,<br/>  Whether into the marble chaos driven<br/>His chisel bid the Hebrew, at whose word<br/>  Israel left Egypt, stop the waves in stone,<br/>  Or hues of Hell be by his pencil poured<br/>Over the damned before the Judgement-throne,<br/>  Such as I saw them, such as all shall see,<br/>  Or fanes be built of grandeur yet unknown--<br/>The Stream of his great thoughts shall spring from me<br/>  The Ghibelline, who traversed the three realms<br/>  Which form the Empire of Eternity.<br/>Amidst the clash of swords, and clang of helms,<br/>  The age which I anticipate, no less<br/>  Shall be the Age of Beauty, and while whelms<br/>Calamity the nations with distress,<br/>  The Genius of my Country shall arise,<br/>  A Cedar towering o'er the Wilderness,<br/>Lovely in all its branches to all eyes,<br/>  Fragrant as fair, and recognised afar,<br/>  Wafting its native incense through the skies.<br/>Sovereigns shall pause amidst their sport of war,<br/>  Weaned for an hour from blood, to turn and gaze<br/>  On canvass or on stone; and they who mar<br/>All beauty upon earth, compelled to praise,<br/>  Shall feel the power of that which they destroy;<br/>  And Art's mistaken gratitude shall raise<br/>To tyrants, who but take her for a toy,<br/>  Emblems and monuments, and prostitute<br/>  Her charms to Pontiffs proud, who but employ<br/>The man of Genius as the meanest brute<br/>  To bear a burthen, and to serve a need,<br/>  To sell his labours, and his soul to boot.<br/>Who toils for nations may be poor indeed,<br/>  But free; who sweats for Monarchs is no more<br/>  Than the gilt Chamberlain, who, clothed and feed,<br/>Stands sleek and slavish, bowing at his door.<br/>  Oh, Power that rulest and inspirest! how<br/>  Is it that they on earth, whose earthly power<br/>Is likest thine in heaven in outward show,<br/>  Least like to thee in attributes divine,<br/>  Tread on the universal necks that bow,<br/>And then assure us that their rights are thine?<br/>  And how is it that they, the Sons of Fame,<br/>  Whose inspiration seems to them to shine<br/>From high, they whom the nations oftest name,<br/>  Must pass their days in penury or pain,<br/>  Or step to grandeur through the paths of shame,<br/>And wear a deeper brand and gaudier chain?<br/>  Or if their Destiny be born aloof<br/>  From lowliness, or tempted thence in vain,<br/>In their own souls sustain a harder proof,<br/>  The inner war of Passions deep and fierce?<br/>  Florence! when thy harsh sentence razed my roof,<br/>I loved thee; but the vengeance of my verse,<br/>  The hate of injuries which every year<br/>  Makes greater, and accumulates my curse,<br/>Shall live, outliving all thou holdest dear--<br/>  Thy pride, thy wealth, thy freedom, and even _that_,<br/>  The most infernal of all evils here,<br/>The sway of petty tyrants in a state;<br/>  For such sway is not limited to Kings,<br/>  And Demagogues yield to them but in date,<br/>As swept off sooner; in all deadly things,<br/>  Which make men hate themselves, and one another,<br/>  In discord, cowardice, cruelty, all that springs<br/>From Death the Sin-born's incest with his mother,<br/>  In rank oppression in its rudest shape,<br/>  The faction Chief is but the Sultan's brother,<br/>And the worst Despot's far less human ape.<br/>  Florence! when this lone spirit, which so long<br/>  Yearned, as the captive toiling at escape,<br/>To fly back to thee in despite of wrong,<br/>  An exile, saddest of all prisoners,<br/>  Who has the whole world for a dungeon strong,<br/>Seas, mountains, and the horizon's verge for bars,<br/>  Which shut him from the sole small spot of earth<br/>  Where--whatsoe'er his fate--he still were hers,<br/>His Country's, and might die where he had birth--<br/>  Florence! when this lone Spirit shall return<br/>  To kindred Spirits, thou wilt feel my worth,<br/>And seek to honour with an empty urn<br/>  The ashes thou shalt ne'er obtain--Alas!<br/>  "What have I done to thee, my People?" Stern<br/>Are all thy dealings, but in this they pass<br/>  The limits of Man's common malice, for<br/>  All that a citizen could be I was--<br/>Raised by thy will, all thine in peace or war--<br/>  And for this thou hast warred with me.--'Tis done:<br/>  I may not overleap the eternal bar<br/>Built up between us, and will die alone,<br/>  Beholding with the dark eye of a Seer<br/>  The evil days to gifted souls foreshown,<br/>Foretelling them to those who will not hear;<br/>  As in the old time, till the hour be come<br/>  When Truth shall strike their eyes through many a tear,<br/>And make them own the Prophet in his tomb.
