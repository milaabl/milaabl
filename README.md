# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 04 by *John Milton*

<p>
    O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw<br/>The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,<br/>Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,<br/>Came furious down to be revenged on men,<br/>Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,<br/>While time was, our first parents had been warned<br/>The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped,<br/>Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare:  For now<br/>Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,<br/>The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,<br/>To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss<br/>Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:<br/>Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold<br/>Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br/>Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth<br/>Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast,<br/>And like a devilish engine back recoils<br/>Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract<br/>His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir<br/>The Hell within him; for within him Hell<br/>He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br/>One step, no more than from himself, can fly<br/>By change of place:  Now conscience wakes despair,<br/>That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory<br/>Of what he was, what is, and what must be<br/>Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.<br/>Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view<br/>Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;<br/>Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun,<br/>Which now sat high in his meridian tower:<br/>Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.<br/>O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned,<br/>Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God<br/>Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars<br/>Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call,<br/>But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,<br/>Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,<br/>That bring to my remembrance from what state<br/>I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;<br/>Till pride and worse ambition threw me down<br/>Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King:<br/>Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return<br/>From me, whom he created what I was<br/>In that bright eminence, and with his good<br/>Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.<br/>What could be less than to afford him praise,<br/>The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,<br/>How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,<br/>And wrought but malice; lifted up so high<br/>I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher<br/>Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br/>The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br/>So burdensome still paying, still to owe,<br/>Forgetful what from him I still received,<br/>And understood not that a grateful mind<br/>By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br/>Indebted and discharged; what burden then<br/>O, had his powerful destiny ordained<br/>Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood<br/>Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised<br/>Ambition!  Yet why not some other Power<br/>As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,<br/>Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great<br/>Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within<br/>Or from without, to all temptations armed.<br/>Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?<br/>Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<br/>But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all?<br/>Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,<br/>To me alike, it deals eternal woe.<br/>Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will<br/>Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br/>Me miserable! which way shall I fly<br/>Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?<br/>Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;<br/>And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep<br/>Still threatening to devour me opens wide,<br/>To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.<br/>O, then, at last relent:  Is there no place<br/>Left for repentance, none for pardon left?<br/>None left but by submission; and that word<br/>Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame<br/>Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced<br/>With other promises and other vaunts<br/>Than to submit, boasting I could subdue<br/>The Omnipotent.  Ay me! they little know<br/>How dearly I abide that boast so vain,<br/>Under what torments inwardly I groan,<br/>While they adore me on the throne of Hell.<br/>With diadem and scepter high advanced,<br/>The lower still I fall, only supreme<br/>In misery:  Such joy ambition finds.<br/>But say I could repent, and could obtain,<br/>By act of grace, my former state; how soon<br/>Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay<br/>What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant<br/>Vows made in pain, as violent and void.<br/>For never can true reconcilement grow,<br/>Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:<br/>Which would but lead me to a worse relapse<br/>And heavier fall:  so should I purchase dear<br/>Short intermission bought with double smart.<br/>This knows my Punisher; therefore as far<br/>From granting he, as I from begging, peace;<br/>All hope excluded thus, behold, in stead<br/>Mankind created, and for him this world.<br/>So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear;<br/>Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;<br/>Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least<br/>Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,<br/>By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;<br/>As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.<br/>Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face<br/>Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;<br/>Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed<br/>Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.<br/>For heavenly minds from such distempers foul<br/>Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware,<br/>Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,<br/>Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br/>That practised falsehood under saintly show,<br/>Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:<br/>Yet not enough had practised to deceive<br/>Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down<br/> The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount<br/> Saw him disfigured, more than could befall<br/> Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce<br/> He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,<br/> As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.<br/> So on he fares, and to the border comes<br/> Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,<br/> Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,<br/> As with a rural mound, the champaign head<br/> Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides<br/>Access denied; and overhead upgrew<br/> Insuperable height of loftiest shade,<br/> Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,<br/> A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,<br/> Shade above shade, a woody theatre<br/> Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops<br/> The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;<br/><br/>Which to our general sire gave prospect large<br/>Into his nether empire neighbouring round.<br/>And higher than that wall a circling row<br/>Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,<br/>Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,<br/>Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:<br/>On which the sun more glad impressed his beams<br/>Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,<br/>When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed<br/>That landskip:  And of pure now purer air<br/>Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires<br/>Vernal delight and joy, able to drive<br/>All sadness but despair:  Now gentle gales,<br/>Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense<br/>Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole<br/>Those balmy spoils.  As when to them who fail<br/>Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past<br/>Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow<br/>Sabean odours from the spicy shore<br/>Of Araby the blest; with such delay<br/>Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league<br/>Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles:<br/>So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend,<br/>Who came their bane; though with them better pleased<br/>Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume<br/>That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse<br/>Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent<br/>From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.<br/>Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill<br/>Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;<br/>But further way found none, so thick entwined,<br/>As one continued brake, the undergrowth<br/>Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed<br/>All path of man or beast that passed that way.<br/>One gate there only was, and that looked east<br/>On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,<br/>Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,<br/>At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound<br/>Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within<br/>Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling wolf,<br/>Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,<br/>Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve<br/>In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,<br/>Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold:<br/>Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash<br/>Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,<br/>Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,<br/>In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles:<br/>So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold;<br/>So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.<br/>Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,<br/>The middle tree and highest there that grew,<br/>Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life<br/>Thereby regained, but sat devising death<br/>To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought<br/>Of that life-giving plant, but only used<br/>For prospect, what well used had been the pledge<br/>Of immortality.  So little knows<br/>Any, but God alone, to value right<br/>The good before him, but perverts best things<br/>To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.<br/>Beneath him with new wonder now he views,<br/>To all delight of human sense exposed,<br/>In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more,<br/>A Heaven on Earth:  For blissful Paradise<br/>Of God the garden was, by him in the east<br/>Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line<br/>From Auran eastward to the royal towers<br/>Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,<br/>Of where the sons of Eden long before<br/>Dwelt in Telassar:  In this pleasant soil<br/>His far more pleasant garden God ordained;<br/>Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow<br/>All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;<br/>And all amid them stood the tree of life,<br/>High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit<br/>Of vegetable gold; and next to life,<br/>Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,<br/>Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.<br/>Southward through Eden went a river large,<br/>Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill<br/>Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown<br/>That mountain as his garden-mould high raised<br/>Upon the rapid current, which, through veins<br/>Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,<br/>Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill<br/>Watered the garden; thence united fell<br/>Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,<br/>Which from his darksome passage now appears,<br/>And now, divided into four main streams,<br/>Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm<br/>And country, whereof here needs no account;<br/>But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,<br/>How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,<br/>Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,<br/>With mazy errour under pendant shades<br/>Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br/>Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art<br/>In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon<br/>Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,<br/>Both where the morning sun first warmly smote<br/>The open field, and where the unpierced shade<br/>Imbrowned the noontide bowers:  Thus was this place<br/>A happy rural seat of various view;<br/>Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,<br/>Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,<br/>Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,<br/>If true, here only, and of delicious taste:<br/>Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks<br/>Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,<br/>Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap<br/>Of some irriguous valley spread her store,<br/>Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:<br/>Another side, umbrageous grots and caves<br/>Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine<br/>Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps<br/>Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall<br/>Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,<br/>That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned<br/>Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.<br/>The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,<br/>Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune<br/>The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,<br/>Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,<br/>Led on the eternal Spring.  Not that fair field<br/>Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,<br/>Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis<br/>Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain<br/>To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove<br/>Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired<br/>Castalian spring, might with this Paradise<br/>Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle<br/>Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,<br/>Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,<br/>Hid Amalthea, and her florid son<br/>Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye;<br/>Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,<br/>Mount Amara, though this by some supposed<br/>True Paradise under the Ethiop line<br/>By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock,<br/>A whole day's journey high, but wide remote<br/>From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend<br/>Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind<br/>Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange<br/>Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,<br/>Godlike erect, with native honour clad<br/>In naked majesty seemed lords of all:<br/>And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine<br/>The image of their glorious Maker shone,<br/>Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,<br/>(Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,)<br/>Whence true authority in men; though both<br/>Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;<br/>For contemplation he and valour formed;<br/>For softness she and sweet attractive grace;<br/>He for God only, she for God in him:<br/>His fair large front and eye sublime declared<br/>Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks<br/>Round from his parted forelock manly hung<br/>Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:<br/>She, as a veil, down to the slender waist<br/>Her unadorned golden tresses wore<br/>Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved<br/>As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied<br/>Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br/>And by her yielded, by him best received,<br/>Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,<br/>And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.<br/>Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed;<br/>Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame<br/>Of nature's works, honour dishonourable,<br/>Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind<br/>With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,<br/>And banished from man's life his happiest life,<br/>Simplicity and spotless innocence!<br/>So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight<br/>Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:<br/>So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair,<br/>That ever since in love's embraces met;<br/>Adam the goodliest man of men since born<br/>His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.<br/>Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br/>Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side<br/>They sat them down; and, after no more toil<br/>Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed<br/>To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease<br/>More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite<br/>More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell,<br/>Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs<br/>Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline<br/>On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:<br/>The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,<br/>Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream;<br/>Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles<br/>Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems<br/>Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,<br/>Alone as they.  About them frisking played<br/>All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase<br/>In wood or wilderness, forest or den;<br/>Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw<br/>Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,<br/>Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,<br/>To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed<br/>His?kithetmroboscis; close the serpent sly,<br/>Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine<br/>His braided train, and of his fatal guile<br/>Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass<br/>Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,<br/>Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,<br/>Declined, was hasting now with prone career<br/>To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale<br/>Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:<br/>When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,<br/>Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.<br/>O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold!<br/>Into our room of bliss thus high advanced<br/>Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,<br/>Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright<br/>Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue<br/>With wonder, and could love, so lively shines<br/>In them divine resemblance, and such grace<br/>The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.<br/>Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh<br/>Your change approaches, when all these delights<br/>Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;<br/>More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;<br/>Happy, but for so happy ill secured<br/>Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven<br/>Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe<br/>As now is entered; yet no purposed foe<br/>To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,<br/>Though I unpitied:  League with you I seek,<br/>And mutual amity, so strait, so close,<br/>That I with you must dwell, or you with me<br/>Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please,<br/>Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such<br/>Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me,<br/>Which I as freely give:  Hell shall unfold,<br/>To entertain you two, her widest gates,<br/>And send forth all her kings; there will be room,<br/>Not like these narrow limits, to receive<br/>Your numerous offspring; if no better place,<br/>Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge<br/>On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.<br/>And should I at your harmless innocence<br/>Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just,<br/>Honour and empire with revenge enlarged,<br/>By conquering this new world, compels me now<br/>To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.<br/>So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,<br/>The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds.<br/>Then from his lofty stand on that high tree<br/>Down he alights among the sportful herd<br/>Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,<br/>Now other, as their shape served best his end<br/>Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,<br/>To mark what of their state he more might learn,<br/>By word or action marked. About them round<br/>A lion now he stalks with fiery glare;<br/>Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied<br/>In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play,<br/>Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft<br/>His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,<br/>Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both,<br/>Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men<br/>To first of women Eve thus moving speech,<br/>Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.<br/>Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,<br/>Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power<br/>That made us, and for us this ample world,<br/>Be infinitely good, and of his good<br/>As liberal and free as infinite;<br/>That raised us from the dust, and placed us here<br/>In all this happiness, who at his hand<br/>Have nothing merited, nor can perform<br/>Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires<br/>From us no other service than to keep<br/>This one, this easy charge, of all the trees<br/>In Paradise that bear delicious fruit<br/>So various, not to taste that only tree<br/>Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life;<br/>So near grows death to life, whate'er death is,<br/>Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest<br/>God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree,<br/>The only sign of our obedience left,<br/>Among so many signs of power and rule<br/>Conferred upon us, and dominion given<br/>Over all other creatures that possess<br/>Earth, air, and sea.  Then let us not think hard<br/>One easy prohibition, who enjoy<br/>Free leave so large to all things else, and choice<br/>Unlimited of manifold delights:<br/>But let us ever praise him, and extol<br/>His bounty, following our delightful task,<br/>To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers,<br/>Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.<br/>To whom thus Eve replied.  O thou for whom<br/>And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,<br/>And without whom am to no end, my guide<br/>And head! what thou hast said is just and right.<br/>For we to him indeed all praises owe,<br/>And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy<br/>So far the happier lot, enjoying thee<br/>Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou<br/>Like consort to thyself canst no where find.<br/>That day I oft remember, when from sleep<br/>I first awaked, and found myself reposed<br/>Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where<br/>And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.<br/>Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound<br/>Of waters issued from a cave, and spread<br/>Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved<br/>Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went<br/>With unexperienced thought, and laid me down<br/>On the green bank, to look into the clear<br/>Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.<br/>As I bent down to look, just opposite<br/>A shape within the watery gleam appeared,<br/>Bending to look on me:  I started back,<br/>It started back; but pleased I soon returned,<br/>Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks<br/>Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed<br/>Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,<br/>Had not a voice thus warned me;  'What thou seest,<br/>'What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;<br/>'With thee it came and goes: but follow me,<br/>'And I will bring thee where no shadow stays<br/>'Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he<br/>'Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy<br/>'Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear<br/>'Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called<br/>'Mother of human race.'  What could I do,<br/>But follow straight, invisibly thus led?<br/>Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,<br/>Under a platane; yet methought less fair,<br/>Less winning soft, less amiably mild,<br/>Than that smooth watery image:  Back I turned;<br/>Thou following cryedst aloud, 'Return, fair Eve;<br/>'Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest, of him thou art,<br/>'His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent<br/>'Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,<br/>'Substantial life, to have thee by my side<br/>'Henceforth an individual solace dear;<br/>'Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim<br/>'My other half:'  With that thy gentle hand<br/>Seised mine:  I yielded;and from that time see<br/>How beauty is excelled by manly grace,<br/>And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.<br/>So spake our general mother, and with eyes<br/>Of conjugal attraction unreproved,<br/>And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned<br/>On our first father; half her swelling breast<br/>Naked met his, under the flowing gold<br/>Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight<br/>Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,<br/>Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter<br/>On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds<br/>That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip<br/>With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned<br/>For envy; yet with jealous leer malign<br/>Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.<br/>Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,<br/>Imparadised in one another's arms,<br/>The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill<br/>Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust,<br/>Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,<br/>Among our other torments not the least,<br/>Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.<br/>Yet let me not forget what I have gained<br/>From their own mouths:  All is not theirs, it seems;<br/>One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,<br/>Forbidden them to taste:  Knowledge forbidden<br/>Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord<br/>Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know?<br/>Can it be death?  And do they only stand<br/>By ignorance?  Is that their happy state,<br/>The proof of their obedience and their faith?<br/>O fair foundation laid whereon to build<br/>Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds<br/>With more desire to know, and to reject<br/>Envious commands, invented with design<br/>To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt<br/>Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,<br/>They taste and die:  What likelier can ensue<br/>But first with narrow search I must walk round<br/>This garden, and no corner leave unspied;<br/>A chance but chance may lead where I may meet<br/>Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,<br/>Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw<br/>What further would be learned.  Live while ye may,<br/>Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,<br/>Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!<br/>So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,<br/>But with sly circumspection, and began<br/>Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale, his roam<br/>Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven<br/>With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun<br/>Slowly descended, and with right aspect<br/>Against the eastern gate of Paradise<br/>Levelled his evening rays:  It was a rock<br/>Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds,<br/>Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent<br/>Accessible from earth, one entrance high;<br/>The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung<br/>Still as it rose, impossible to climb.<br/>Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,<br/>Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night;<br/>About him exercised heroick games<br/>The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand<br/>Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears,<br/>Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.<br/>Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even<br/>On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star<br/>In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired<br/>Impress the air, and shows the mariner<br/>From what point of his compass to beware<br/>Impetuous winds:  He thus began in haste.<br/>Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given<br/>Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place<br/>No evil thing approach or enter in.<br/>This day at highth of noon came to my sphere<br/>A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know<br/>More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man,<br/>God's latest image:  I described his way<br/>Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait;<br/>But in the mount that lies from Eden north,<br/>Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks<br/>Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:<br/>Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade<br/>Lost sight of him:  One of the banished crew,<br/>I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise<br/>New troubles; him thy care must be to find.<br/>To whom the winged warriour thus returned.<br/>Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,<br/>Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst,<br/>See far and wide:  In at this gate none pass<br/>The vigilance here placed, but such as come<br/>Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour<br/>No creature thence:  If Spirit of other sort,<br/>So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds<br/>On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude<br/>Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.<br/>But if within the circuit of these walks,<br/>In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom<br/>Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.<br/>So promised he; and Uriel to his charge<br/>Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised<br/>Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen<br/>Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,<br/>Incredible how swift, had thither rolled<br/>Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,<br/>By shorter flight to the east, had left him there<br/>Arraying with reflected purple and gold<br/>The clouds that on his western throne attend.<br/>Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray<br/>Had in her sober livery all things clad;<br/>Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,<br/>They to their grassy couch, these to their nests<br/>Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;<br/>She all night long her amorous descant sung;<br/>Silence was pleased:  Now glowed the firmament<br/>With living sapphires:  Hesperus, that led<br/>The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,<br/>Rising in clouded majesty, at length<br/>Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,<br/>And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.<br/>When Adam thus to Eve.  Fair Consort, the hour<br/>Of night, and all things now retired to rest,<br/>Mind us of like repose; since God hath set<br/>Labour and rest, as day and night, to men<br/>Successive; and the timely dew of sleep,<br/>Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines<br/>Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long<br/>Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;<br/>Man hath his daily work of body or mind<br/>Appointed, which declares his dignity,<br/>And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;<br/>While other animals unactive range,<br/>And of their doings God takes no account.<br/>To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east<br/>With first approach of light, we must be risen,<br/>And at our pleasant labour, to reform<br/>Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green,<br/>Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,<br/>That mock our scant manuring, and require<br/>More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth:<br/>Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,<br/>That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,<br/>Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;<br/>Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.<br/>To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned<br/>My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst<br/>Unargued I obey:  So God ordains;<br/>God is thy law, thou mine:  To know no more<br/>Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise.<br/>With thee conversing I forget all time;<br/>All seasons, and their change, all please alike.<br/>Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,<br/>With charm of earliest birds:  pleasant the sun,<br/>When first on this delightful land he spreads<br/>His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,<br/>Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth<br/>After soft showers; and sweet the coming on<br/>Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,<br/>With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,<br/>And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:<br/>But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends<br/>With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun<br/>On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,<br/>Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;<br/>Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,<br/>With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,<br/>Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.<br/>But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom<br/>This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?<br/>To whom our general ancestor replied.<br/>Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,<br/>These have their course to finish round the earth,<br/>By morrow evening, and from land to land<br/>In order, though to nations yet unborn,<br/>Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;<br/>Lest total Darkness should by night regain<br/>Her old possession, and extinguish life<br/>In Nature and all things; which these soft fires<br/>Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat<br/>Of various influence foment and warm,<br/>Temper or nourish, or in part shed down<br/>Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow<br/>On earth, made hereby apter to receive<br/>Perfection from the sun's more potent ray.<br/>These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,<br/>Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,<br/>That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:<br/>Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth<br/>Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:<br/>All these with ceaseless praise his works behold<br/>Both day and night:  How often from the steep<br/>Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard<br/>Celestial voices to the midnight air,<br/>Sole, or responsive each to others note,<br/>Singing their great Creator? oft in bands<br/>While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,<br/>With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds<br/>In full harmonick number joined, their songs<br/>Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.<br/>Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed<br/>On to their blissful bower: it was a place<br/>Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed<br/>All things to Man's delightful use; the roof<br/>Of thickest covert was inwoven shade<br/>Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew<br/>Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side<br/>Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub,<br/>Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower,<br/>Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,<br/>Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought<br/>Mosaick; underfoot the violet,<br/>Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay<br/>Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone<br/>Of costliest emblem:  Other creature here,<br/>Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none,<br/>Such was their awe of Man.  In shadier bower<br/>More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,<br/>Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph<br/>Nor Faunus haunted.  Here, in close recess,<br/>With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,<br/>Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed;<br/>And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,<br/>What day the genial Angel to our sire<br/>Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,<br/>More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods<br/>Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like<br/>In sad event, when to the unwiser son<br/>Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared<br/>Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged<br/>On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire.<br/>Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,<br/>Both turned, and under open sky adored<br/>The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,<br/>Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,<br/>And starry pole:  Thou also madest the night,<br/>Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,<br/>Which we, in our appointed work employed,<br/>Have finished, happy in our mutual help<br/>And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss<br/>Ordained by thee; and this delicious place<br/>For us too large, where thy abundance wants<br/>Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.<br/>But thou hast promised from us two a race<br/>To fill the earth, who shall with us extol<br/>Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,<br/>And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.<br/>This said unanimous, and other rites<br/>Observing none, but adoration pure<br/>Which God likes best, into their inmost bower<br/>Handed they went; and, eased the putting off<br/>These troublesome disguises which we wear,<br/>Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween,<br/>Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites<br/>Mysterious of connubial love refused:<br/>Whatever hypocrites austerely talk<br/>Of purity, and place, and innocence,<br/>Defaming as impure what God declares<br/>Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.<br/>Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain<br/>But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?<br/>Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source<br/>Of human offspring, sole propriety<br/>In Paradise of all things common else!<br/>By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men<br/>Among the bestial herds to range; by thee<br/>Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,<br/>Relations dear, and all the charities<br/>Of father, son, and brother, first were known.<br/>Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,<br/>Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,<br/>Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets,<br/>Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,<br/>Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.<br/>Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights<br/>His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,<br/>Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile<br/>Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,<br/>Casual fruition; nor in court-amours,<br/>Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,<br/>Or serenate, which the starved lover sings<br/>To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.<br/>These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept,<br/>And on their naked limbs the flowery roof<br/>Showered roses, which the morn repaired.  Sleep on,<br/>Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek<br/>No happier state, and know to know no more.<br/>Now had night measured with her shadowy cone<br/>Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,<br/>And from their ivory port the Cherubim,<br/>Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed<br/>To their night watches in warlike parade;<br/>When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.<br/>Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south<br/>With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;<br/>Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part,<br/>Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.<br/>From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called<br/>That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.<br/>Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed<br/>Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook;<br/>But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,<br/>Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.<br/>This evening from the sun's decline arrived,<br/>Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen<br/>Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped<br/>The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:<br/>Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.<br/>So saying, on he led his radiant files,<br/>Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct<br/>In search of whom they sought:  Him there they found<br/>Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,<br/>Assaying by his devilish art to reach<br/>The organs of her fancy, and with them forge<br/>Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams;<br/>Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint<br/>The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise<br/>Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise<br/>At least distempered, discontented thoughts,<br/>Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,<br/>Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.<br/>Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear<br/>Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure<br/>Touch of celestial temper, but returns<br/>Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts<br/>Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark<br/>Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid<br/>Fit for the tun some magazine to store<br/>Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,<br/>With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;<br/>So started up in his own shape the Fiend.<br/>Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed<br/>So sudden to behold the grisly king;<br/>Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.<br/>Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell<br/>Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed,<br/>Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait,<br/>Here watching at the head of these that sleep?<br/>Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn,<br/>Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate<br/>For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar:<br/>Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,<br/>The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,<br/>Why ask ye, and superfluous begin<br/>Your message, like to end as much in vain?<br/>To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.<br/>Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,<br/>Or undiminished brightness to be known,<br/>As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure;<br/>That glory then, when thou no more wast good,<br/>Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now<br/>Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.<br/>But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account<br/>To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep<br/>This place inviolable, and these from harm.<br/>So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,<br/>Severe in youthful beauty, added grace<br/>Invincible:  Abashed the Devil stood,<br/>And felt how awful goodness is, and saw<br/>Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined<br/>His loss; but chiefly to find here observed<br/>His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed<br/>Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,<br/>Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,<br/>Or all at once; more glory will be won,<br/>Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold,<br/>Will save us trial what the least can do<br/>Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.<br/>The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;<br/>But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,<br/>Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly<br/>He held it vain; awe from above had quelled<br/>His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh<br/>The western point, where those half-rounding guards<br/>Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,<br/>A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief,<br/>Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.<br/>O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet<br/>Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern<br/>Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;<br/>And with them comes a third of regal port,<br/>But faded splendour wan; who by his gait<br/>And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,<br/>Not likely to part hence without contest;<br/>Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.<br/>He scarce had ended, when those two approached,<br/>And brief related whom they brought, where found,<br/>How busied, in what form and posture couched.<br/>To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.<br/>Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed<br/>To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge<br/>Of others, who approve not to transgress<br/>By thy example, but have power and right<br/>To question thy bold entrance on this place;<br/>Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those<br/>Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!<br/>To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.<br/>Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,<br/>And such I held thee; but this question asked<br/>Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain!<br/>Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,<br/>Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt<br/>And boldly venture to whatever place<br/>Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change<br/>Torment with ease, and soonest recompense<br/>Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;<br/>To thee no reason, who knowest only good,<br/>But evil hast not tried: and wilt object<br/>His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar<br/>His iron gates, if he intends our stay<br/>In that dark durance:  Thus much what was asked.<br/>The rest is true, they found me where they say;<br/>But that implies not violence or harm.<br/>Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved,<br/>Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.<br/>O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise<br/>Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,<br/>And now returns him from his prison 'scaped,<br/>Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise<br/>Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither<br/>Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed;<br/>So wise he judges it to fly from pain<br/>However, and to 'scape his punishment!<br/>So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,<br/>Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight<br/>Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,<br/>Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain<br/>Can equal anger infinite provoked.<br/>But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee<br/>Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they<br/>Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief!<br/>The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged<br/>To thy deserted host this cause of flight,<br/>Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.<br/>To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.<br/>Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,<br/>Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood<br/>Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid<br/>The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,<br/>And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.<br/>But still thy words at random, as before,<br/>Argue thy inexperience what behoves<br/>From hard assays and ill successes past<br/>A faithful leader, not to hazard all<br/>Through ways of danger by himself untried:<br/>I, therefore, I alone first undertook<br/>To wing the desolate abyss, and spy<br/>This new created world, whereof in Hell<br/>Fame is not silent, here in hope to find<br/>Better abode, and my afflicted Powers<br/>To settle here on earth, or in mid air;<br/>Though for possession put to try once more<br/>What thou and thy gay legions dare against;<br/>Whose easier business were to serve their Lord<br/>High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne,<br/>And practised distances to cringe, not fight,<br/>To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.<br/>To say and straight unsay, pretending first<br/>Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,<br/>Argues no leader but a liear traced,<br/>Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,<br/>O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!<br/>Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?<br/>Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.<br/>Was this your discipline and faith engaged,<br/>Your military obedience, to dissolve<br/>Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?<br/>And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem<br/>Patron of liberty, who more than thou<br/>Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored<br/>Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope<br/>To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?<br/>But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant;<br/>Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour<br/>Within these hallowed limits thou appear,<br/>Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,<br/>And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn<br/>The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.<br/>So threatened he; but Satan to no threats<br/>Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.<br/>Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,<br/>Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then<br/>Far heavier load thyself expect to feel<br/>From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King<br/>Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,<br/>Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels<br/>In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.<br/>While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright<br/>Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns<br/>Their phalanx, and began to hem him round<br/>With ported spears, as thick as when a field<br/>Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends<br/>Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind<br/>Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands,<br/>Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves<br/>Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed,<br/>Collecting all his might, dilated stood,<br/>Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:<br/>His stature reached the sky, and on his crest<br/>Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp<br/>What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds<br/>Might have ensued, nor only Paradise<br/>In this commotion, but the starry cope<br/>Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements<br/>At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn<br/>With violence of this conflict, had not soon<br/>The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,<br/>Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen<br/>Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,<br/>Wherein all things created first he weighed,<br/>The pendulous round earth with balanced air<br/>In counterpoise, now ponders all events,<br/>Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights,<br/>The sequel each of parting and of fight:<br/>The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam,<br/>Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.<br/>Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine;<br/>Neither our own, but given:  What folly then<br/>To boast what arms can do? since thine no more<br/>Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now<br/>To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up,<br/>And read thy lot in yon celestial sign;<br/>Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,<br/>If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew<br/>His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more;but fled<br/>Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
