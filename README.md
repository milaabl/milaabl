  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Prayer by *Richard Crashaw*

<p>
    LO here a little volume, but great Book<br/>A nest of new-born sweets;<br/>Whose native fires disdaining<br/>To ly thus folded, and complaining<br/>Of these ignoble sheets,<br/>Affect more comly bands<br/>(Fair one) from the kind hands<br/>And confidently look<br/>To find the rest<br/>Of a rich binding in your Brest.<br/>It is, in one choise handfull, heavenn; and all<br/>Heavn‚Äôs Royall host; incamp‚Äôt thus small<br/>To prove that true schooles use to tell,<br/>Ten thousand Angels in one point can dwell.<br/>It is love‚Äôs great artillery<br/>Which here contracts itself, and comes to ly<br/>Close couch‚Äôt in their white bosom: and from thence<br/>As from a snowy fortresse of defence,<br/>Against their ghostly foes to take their part,<br/>And fortify the hold of their chast heart.<br/>It is an armory of light<br/>Let constant use but keep it bright,<br/>You‚Äôl find it yeilds<br/>To holy hands and humble hearts<br/>More swords and sheilds<br/>Then sin hath snares, or Hell hath darts.<br/>Only be sure<br/>The hands be pure<br/>That hold these weapons; and the eyes<br/>Those of turtles, chast and true;<br/>Wakefull and wise;<br/>Here is a freind shall fight for you,<br/>Hold but this book before their heart;<br/>Let prayer alone to play his part,<br/>But —Ñ the heart<br/>That studyes this high Art<br/>Must be a sure house-keeper<br/>And yet no sleeper.<br/>Dear soul, be strong.<br/>Mercy will come e‚Äôre long<br/>And bring his bosom fraught with blessings,<br/>Flowers of never fading graces<br/>To make immortall dressings<br/>For worthy soules, whose wise embraces<br/>Store up themselves for Him, who is alone<br/>The Spouse of Virgins and the Virgin‚Äôs son.<br/>But if the noble Bridegroom, when he come<br/>Shall find the loytering Heart from home;<br/>Leaving her chast aboad<br/>To gadde abroad<br/>Among the gay mates of the god of flyes;<br/>To take her pleasure and to play<br/>And keep the devill‚Äôs holyday;<br/>To dance th‚Äôsunshine of some smiling<br/>But beguiling<br/>Spheares of sweet and sugred Lyes,<br/>Some slippery Pair<br/>Of false, perhaps as fair,<br/>Flattering but forswearing eyes;<br/>Doubtlesse some other heart<br/>Will gett the start<br/>Mean while, and stepping in before<br/>Will take possession of that sacred store<br/>Of hidden sweets and holy ioyes.<br/>Words which are not heard with Eares<br/>(Those tumultuous shops of noise)<br/>Effectuall wispers, whose still voice<br/>The soul it selfe more feeles then heares;<br/>Amorous languishments; luminous trances;<br/>Sights which are not seen with eyes;<br/>Spirituall and soul-peircing glances<br/>Whose pure and subtil lightning flyes<br/>Home to the heart, and setts the house on fire<br/>And melts it down in sweet desire<br/>Yet does not stay<br/>To ask the windows leave to passe that way;<br/>Delicious Deaths; soft exalations<br/>Of soul; dear and divine annihilations;<br/>A thousand unknown rites<br/>Of ioyes and rarefy‚Äôd delights;<br/>A hundred thousand goods, glories, and graces,<br/>And many a mystick thing<br/>Which the divine embraces<br/>Of the deare spouse of spirits with them will bring<br/>For which it is no shame<br/>That dull mortality must not know a name.<br/>Of all this store<br/>Of blessings and ten thousand more<br/>(If when he come<br/>He find the Heart from home)<br/>Doubtlesse he will unload<br/>Himself some other where,<br/>And poure abroad<br/>His pretious sweets<br/>On the fair soul whom first he meets.<br/>O fair, —Ñ fortunate! O riche, —Ñ dear!<br/>O happy and thrice happy she<br/>Selected dove<br/>Who ere she be,<br/>Whose early love<br/>With winged vowes<br/>Makes hast to meet her morning spouse<br/>And close with his immortall kisses.<br/>Happy indeed, who never misses<br/>To improve that pretious hour,<br/>And every day<br/>Seize her sweet prey<br/>All fresh and fragrant as he rises<br/>Dropping with a baulmy Showr<br/>A delicious dew of spices;<br/>O let the blissfull heart hold fast<br/>Her heavnly arm-full, she shall tast<br/>At once ten thousand paradises;<br/>She shall have power<br/>To rifle and deflour<br/>The rich and roseall spring of those rare sweets<br/>Which with a swelling bosome there she meets<br/>Boundles and infinite<br/>Bottomles treasures<br/>Of pure inebriating pleasures<br/>Happy proof! she shal discover<br/>What ioy, what blisse,<br/>How many Heav‚Äôns at once it is<br/>To have her God become her Lover.
