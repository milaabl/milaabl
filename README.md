<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Age of Bronze by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    The "good old times"--all times when old are good--<br/>Are gone; the present might be if they would;<br/>Great things have been, and are, and greater still<br/>Want little of mere mortals but their will:<br/>A wider space, a greener field, is given<br/>To those who play their "tricks before high heaven."<br/>I know not if the angels weep, but men<br/>Have wept enough--for what?--to weep again!<br/><br/>All is exploded--be it good or bad.<br/>Reader! remember when thou wert a lad,<br/>Then Pitt was all; or, if not all, so much,<br/>His very rival almost deemed him such.<br/>We--we have seen the intellectual race<br/>Of giants stand, like Titans, face to face--<br/>Athos and Ida, with a dashing sea<br/>Of eloquence between, which flowed all free,<br/>As the deep billows of the √Ügean roar<br/>Betwixt the Hellenic and the Phrygian shore.<br/>But where are they--the rivals! a few feet<br/>Of sullen earth divide each winding sheet.<br/>How peaceful and how powerful is the grave,<br/>Which hushes all! a calm, unstormy wave,<br/>Which oversweeps the World. The theme is old<br/>Of "Dust to Dust," but half its tale untold:<br/>Time tempers not its terrors--still the worm<br/>Winds its cold folds, the tomb preserves its form,<br/>Varied above, but still alike below;<br/>The urn may shine--the ashes will not glow--<br/>Though Cleopatra's mummy cross the sea<br/>O'er which from empire she lured Anthony;<br/>Though Alexander's urn a show be grown<br/>On shores he wept to conquer, though unknown--<br/>How vain, how worse than vain, at length appear<br/>The madman's wish, the Macedonian's tear!<br/>He wept for worlds to conquer--half the earth<br/>Knows not his name, or but his death, and birth,<br/>And desolation; while his native Greece<br/>Hath all of desolation, save its peace.<br/>He "wept for worlds to conquer!" he who ne'er<br/>Conceived the Globe, he panted not to spare!<br/>With even the busy Northern Isle unknown,<br/>Which holds his urn--and never knew his throne.<br/><br/>But where is he, the modern, mightier far,<br/>Who, born no king, made monarchs draw his car;<br/>The new Sesostris, whose unharnessed kings,<br/>Freed from the bit, believe themselves with wings,<br/>And spurn the dust o'er which they crawled of late,<br/>Chained to the chariot of the Chieftain's state?<br/>Yes! where is he, "the champion and the child"<br/>Of all that's great or little--wise or wild;<br/>Whose game was Empire, and whose stakes were thrones;<br/>Whose table Earth--whose dice were human bones?<br/>Behold the grand result in yon lone Isle,<br/>And, as thy nature urges--weep or smile.<br/>Sigh to behold the Eagle's lofty rage<br/>Reduced to nibble at his narrow cage;<br/>Smile to survey the queller of the nations<br/>Now daily squabbling o'er disputed rations;<br/>Weep to perceive him mourning, as he dines,<br/>O'er curtailed dishes and o'er stinted wines;<br/>O'er petty quarrels upon petty things.<br/>Is this the Man who scourged or feasted kings?<br/>Behold the scales in which his fortune hangs,<br/>A surgeon's statement, and an earl's harangues!<br/>A bust delayed,--a book refused, can shake<br/>The sleep of Him who kept the world awake.<br/>Is this indeed the tamer of the Great,<br/>Now slave of all could tease or irritate--<br/>The paltry gaoler and the prying spy,<br/>The staring stranger with his note-book nigh?<br/>Plunged in a dungeon, he had still been great;<br/>How low, how little was this middle state,<br/>Between a prison and a palace, where<br/>How few could feel for what he had to bear!<br/>Vain his complaint,--My Lord presents his bill,<br/>His food and wine were doled out duly still;<br/>Vain was his sickness, never was a clime<br/>So free from homicide--to doubt's crime;<br/>And the stiff surgeon, who maintained his cause,<br/>Hath lost his place, and gained the world's applause.<br/>But smile--though all the pangs of brain and heart<br/>Disdain, defy, the tardy aid of art;<br/>Though, save the few fond friends and imaged face<br/>Of that fair boy his Sire shall ne'er embrace,<br/>None stand by his low bed--though even the mind<br/>Be wavering, which long awed and awes mankind:<br/>Smile--for the fettered Eagle breaks his chain,<br/>And higher Worlds than this are his again.<br/><br/>How, if that soaring Spirit still retain<br/>A conscious twilight of his blazing reign,<br/>How must he smile, on looking down, to see<br/>The little that he was and sought to be!<br/>What though his Name a wider empire found<br/>Than his Ambition, though with scarce a bound;<br/>Though first in glory, deepest in reverse,<br/>He tasted Empire's blessings and its curse;<br/>Though kings, rejoicing in their late escape<br/>From chains, would gladly be _their_ Tyrant's ape;<br/>How must he smile, and turn to yon lone grave,<br/>The proudest Sea-mark that o'ertops the wave!<br/>What though his gaoler, duteous to the last,<br/>Scarce deemed the coffin's lead could keep him fast,<br/>Refusing one poor line along the lid,<br/>To date the birth and death of all it hid;<br/>That name shall hallow the ignoble shore,<br/>A talisman to all save him who bore:<br/>The fleets that sweep before the eastern blast<br/>Shall hear their sea-boys hail it from the mast;<br/>When Victory's Gallic column shall but rise,<br/>Like Pompey's pillar, in a desert's skies,<br/>The rocky Isle that holds or held his dust,<br/>Shall crown the Atlantic like the Hero's bust,<br/>And mighty Nature o'er his obsequies<br/>Do more than niggard Envy still denies.<br/>But what are these to him? Can Glory's lust<br/>Touch the freed spirit or the fettered dust?<br/>Small care hath he of what his tomb consists;<br/>Nought if he sleeps--nor more if he exists:<br/>Alike the better-seeing Shade will smile<br/>On the rude cavern of the rocky isle,<br/>As if his ashes found their latest home<br/>In Rome's Pantheon or Gaul's mimic dome.<br/>He wants not this; but France shall feel the want<br/>Of this last consolation, though so scant:<br/>Her Honour--Fame--and Faith demand his bones,<br/>To rear above a Pyramid of thrones;<br/>Or carried onward in the battle's van,<br/>To form, like Guesclin's dust, her Talisman.<br/>But be it as it is--the time may come<br/>His name shall beat the alarm, like Ziska's drum.<br/><br/>Oh Heaven! of which he was in power a feature;<br/>Oh Earth! of which he was a noble creature;<br/>Thou Isle! to be remembered long and well,<br/>That saw'st the unfledged eaglet chip his shell!<br/>Ye Alps which viewed him in his dawning flights<br/>Hover, the Victor of a hundred fights!<br/>Thou Rome, who saw'st thy C√¶sar's deeds outdone!<br/>Alas! why passed he too the Rubicon--<br/>The Rubicon of Man's awakened rights,<br/>To herd with vulgar kings and parasites?<br/>Egypt! from whose all dateless tombs arose<br/>Forgotten Pharaohs from their long repose,<br/>And shook within their pyramids to hear<br/>A new Cambyses thundering in their ear;<br/>While the dark shades of Forty Ages stood<br/>Like startled giants by Nile's famous flood;<br/>Or from the Pyramid's tall pinnacle<br/>Beheld the desert peopled, as from hell,<br/>With clashing hosts, who strewed the barren sand,<br/>To re-manure the uncultivated land!<br/>Spain! which, a moment mindless of the Cid,<br/>Beheld his banner flouting thy Madrid!<br/>Austria! which saw thy twice-ta'en capital<br/>Twice spared to be the traitress of his fall!<br/>Ye race of Frederic!--Frederics but in name<br/>And falsehood--heirs to all except his fame:<br/>Who, crushed at Jena, crouched at Berlin, fell<br/>First, and but rose to follow! Ye who dwell<br/>Where Kosciusko dwelt, remembering yet<br/>The unpaid amount of Catherine's bloody debt!<br/>Poland! o'er which the avenging Angel past,<br/>But left thee as he found thee, still a waste,<br/>Forgetting all thy still enduring claim,<br/>Thy lotted people and extinguished name,<br/>Thy sigh for freedom, thy long-flowing tear,<br/>That sound that crashes in the tyrant's ear--<br/>Kosciusko! On--on--on--the thirst of War<br/>Gasps for the gore of serfs and of their Czar.<br/>The half barbaric Moscow's minarets<br/>Gleam in the sun, but 'tis a sun that sets!<br/>Moscow! thou limit of his long career,<br/>For which rude Charles had wept his frozen tear<br/>To see in vain--_he_ saw thee--how? with spire<br/>And palace fuel to one common fire.<br/>To this the soldier lent his kindling match,<br/>To this the peasant gave his cottage thatch,<br/>To this the merchant flung his hoarded store,<br/>The prince his hall--and Moscow was no more!<br/>Sublimest of volcanoes! Etna's flame<br/>Pales before thine, and quenchless Hecla's tame;<br/>Vesuvius shows his blaze, an usual sight<br/>For gaping tourists, from his hackneyed height:<br/>Thou stand'st alone unrivalled, till the Fire<br/>To come, in which all empires shall expire!<br/><br/>  Thou other Element! as strong and stern,<br/>To teach a lesson conquerors will not learn!--<br/>Whose icy wing flapped o'er the faltering foe,<br/>Till fell a hero with each flake of snow;<br/>How did thy numbing beak and silent fang,<br/>Pierce, till hosts perished with a single pang!<br/>In vain shall Seine look up along his banks<br/>For the gay thousands of his dashing ranks!<br/>In vain shall France recall beneath her vines<br/>Her Youth--their blood flows faster than her wines;<br/>Or stagnant in their human ice remains<br/>In frozen mummies on the Polar plains.<br/>In vain will Italy's broad sun awaken<br/>Her offspring chilled; its beams are now forsaken.<br/>Of all the trophies gathered from the war,<br/>What shall return? the Conqueror's broken car!<br/>The Conqueror's yet unbroken heart! Again<br/>The horn of Roland sounds, and not in vain.<br/>Lutzen, where fell the Swede of victory,<br/>Beholds him conquer, but, alas! not die:<br/>Dresden surveys three despots fly once more<br/>Before their sovereign,--sovereign as before;<br/>But there exhausted Fortune quits the field,<br/>And Leipsic's treason bids the unvanquished yield;<br/>The Saxon jackal leaves the lion's side<br/>To turn the bear's, and wolf's, and fox's guide;<br/>And backward to the den of his despair<br/>The forest monarch shrinks, but finds no lair!<br/><br/>  Oh ye! and each, and all! Oh France! who found<br/>Thy long fair fields ploughed up as hostile ground,<br/>Disputed foot by foot, till Treason, still<br/>His only victor, from Montmartre's hill<br/>Looked down o'er trampled Paris! and thou Isle,<br/>Which seest Etruria from thy ramparts smile,<br/>Thou momentary shelter of his pride,<br/>Till wooed by danger, his yet weeping bride!<br/>Oh, France! retaken by a single march,<br/>Whose path was through one long triumphal arch!<br/>Oh bloody and most bootless Waterloo!<br/>Which proves how fools may have their fortune too,<br/>Won half by blunder, half by treachery:<br/>Oh dull Saint Helen! with thy gaoler nigh--<br/>Hear! hear Prometheus from his rock appeal<br/>To Earth,--Air,--Ocean,--all that felt or feel<br/>His power and glory, all who yet shall hear<br/>A name eternal as the rolling year;<br/>He teaches them the lesson taught so long,<br/>So oft, so vainly--learn to do no wrong!<br/>A single step into the right had made<br/>This man the Washington of worlds betrayed:<br/>A single step into the wrong has given<br/>His name a doubt to all the winds of heaven;<br/>The reed of Fortune, and of thrones the rod,<br/>Of Fame the Moloch or the demigod;<br/>His country's C√¶sar, Europe's Hannibal,<br/>Without their decent dignity of fall.<br/>Yet Vanity herself had better taught<br/>A surer path even to the fame he sought,<br/>By pointing out on History's fruitless page<br/>Ten thousand conquerors for a single sage.<br/>While Franklin's quiet memory climbs to Heaven,<br/>Calming the lightning which he thence hath riven,<br/>Or drawing from the no less kindled earth<br/>Freedom and peace to that which boasts his birth;<br/>While Washington's a watchword, such as ne'er<br/>Shall sink while there's an echo left to air:<br/>While even the Spaniard's thirst of gold and war<br/>Forgets Pizarro to shout Bolivar!<br/>Alas! why must the same Atlantic wave<br/>Which wafted freedom gird a tyrant's grave--<br/>The king of kings, and yet of slaves the slave,<br/>Who burst the chains of millions to renew<br/>The very fetters which his arm broke through,<br/>And crushed the rights of Europe and his own,<br/>To flit between a dungeon and a throne?<br/><br/>But 'twill not be--the spark's awakened--lo!<br/>The swarthy Spaniard feels his former glow;<br/>The same high spirit which beat back the Moor<br/>Through eight long ages of alternate gore<br/>Revives--and where? in that avenging clime<br/>Where Spain was once synonymous with crime,<br/>Where Cortes' and Pizarro's banner flew,<br/>The infant world redeems her name of "_New_."<br/>'Tis the _old_ aspiration breathed afresh,<br/>To kindle souls within degraded flesh,<br/>Such as repulsed the Persian from the shore<br/>Where Greece _was_--No! she still is Greece once more.<br/>One common cause makes myriads of one breast,<br/>Slaves of the East, or helots of the West:<br/>On Andes' and on Athos' peaks unfurled,<br/>The self-same standard streams o'er either world:<br/>The Athenian wears again Harmodius' sword;<br/>The Chili chief abjures his foreign lord;<br/>The Spartan knows himself once more a Greek,<br/>Young Freedom plumes the crest of each cacique;<br/>Debating despots, hemmed on either shore,<br/>Shrink vainly from the roused Atlantic's roar;<br/>Through Calpe's strait the rolling tides advance,<br/>Sweep slightly by the half-tamed land of France,<br/>Dash o'er the old Spaniard's cradle, and would fain<br/>Unite Ausonia to the mighty main:<br/>But driven from thence awhile, yet not for aye,<br/>Break o'er th' √Ügean, mindful of the day<br/>Of Salamis!--there, there the waves arise,<br/>Not to be lulled by tyrant victories.<br/>Lone, lost, abandoned in their utmost need<br/>By Christians, unto whom they gave their creed,<br/>The desolated lands, the ravaged isle,<br/>The fostered feud encouraged to beguile,<br/>The aid evaded, and the cold delay,<br/>Prolonged but in the hope to make a prey;--<br/>These, these shall tell the tale, and Greece can show<br/>The false friend worse than the infuriate foe.<br/>But this is well: Greeks only should free Greece,<br/>Not the barbarian, with his masque of peace.<br/>How should the Autocrat of bondage be<br/>The king of serfs, and set the nations free?<br/>Better still serve the haughty Mussulman,<br/>Than swell the Cossaque's prowling caravan;<br/>Better still toil for masters, than await,<br/>The slave of slaves, before a Russian gate,--<br/>Numbered by hordes, a human capital,<br/>A live estate, existing but for thrall,<br/>Lotted by thousands, as a meet reward<br/>For the first courtier in the Czar's regard;<br/>While their immediate owner never tastes<br/>His sleep, _sans_ dreaming of Siberia's wastes:<br/>Better succumb even to their own despair,<br/>And drive the Camel--than purvey the Bear.<br/><br/>But not alone within the hoariest clime<br/>Where Freedom dates her birth with that of Time,<br/>And not alone where, plunged in night, a crowd<br/>Of Incas darken to a dubious cloud,<br/>The dawn revives: renowned, romantic Spain<br/>Holds back the invader from her soil again.<br/>Not now the Roman tribe nor Punic horde<br/>Demands her fields as lists to prove the sword;<br/>Not now the Vandal or the Visigoth<br/>Pollute the plains, alike abhorring both;<br/>Nor old Pelayo on his mountain rears<br/>The warlike fathers of a thousand years.<br/>That seed is sown and reaped, as oft the Moor<br/>Sighs to remember on his dusky shore.<br/>Long in the peasant's song or poet's page<br/>Has dwelt the memory of Abencerrage;<br/>The Zegri, and the captive victors, flung<br/>Back to the barbarous realm from whence they sprung.<br/>But these are gone--their faith, their swords, their sway,<br/>Yet left more anti-christian foes than they;<br/>The bigot monarch, and the butcher priest,<br/>The Inquisition, with her burning feast,<br/>The Faith's red "Auto," fed with human fuel,<br/>While sate the catholic Moloch, calmly cruel,<br/>Enjoying, with inexorable eye,<br/>That fiery festival of Agony!<br/>The stern or feeble sovereign, one or both<br/>By turns; the haughtiness whose pride was sloth;<br/>The long degenerate noble; the debased<br/>Hidalgo, and the peasant less disgraced,<br/>But more degraded; the unpeopled realm;<br/>The once proud navy which forgot the helm;<br/>The once impervious phalanx disarrayed;<br/>The idle forge that formed Toledo's blade;<br/>The foreign wealth that flowed on every shore,<br/>Save hers who earned it with the native's gore;<br/>The very language which might vie with Rome's,<br/>And once was known to nations like their homes,<br/>Neglected or forgotten:--such _was_ Spain;<br/>But such she is not, nor shall be again.<br/>These worst, these _home_ invaders, felt and feel<br/>The new Numantine soul of old Castile,<br/>Up! up again! undaunted Tauridor!<br/>The bull of Phalaris renews his roar;<br/>Mount, chivalrous Hidalgo! not in vain<br/>Revive the cry--"Iago! and close Spain!"<br/>Yes, close her with your arm√©d bosoms round,<br/>And form the barrier which Napoleon found,--<br/>The exterminating war, the desert plain,<br/>The streets without a tenant, save the slain;<br/>The wild Sierra, with its wilder troop<br/>Of vulture-plumed Guerrillas, on the stoop<br/>For their incessant prey; the desperate wall<br/>Of Saragossa, mightiest in her fall;<br/>The Man nerved to a spirit, and the Maid<br/>Waving her more than Amazonian blade;<br/>The knife of Arragon, Toledo's steel;<br/>The famous lance of chivalrous Castile;<br/>The unerring rifle of the Catalan;<br/>The Andalusian courser in the van;<br/>The torch to make a Moscow of Madrid;<br/>And in each heart the spirit of the Cid:--<br/>Such have been, such shall be, such are. Advance,<br/>And win--not Spain! but thine own freedom, France!<br/><br/>But lo! a Congress! What! that hallowed name<br/>Which freed the Atlantic! May we hope the same<br/>For outworn Europe? With the sound arise,<br/>Like Samuel's shade to Saul's monarchic eyes,<br/>The prophets of young Freedom, summoned far<br/>From climes of Washington and Bolivar;<br/>Henry, the forest-born Demosthenes,<br/>Whose thunder shook the Philip of the seas;<br/>And stoic Franklin's energetic shade,<br/>Robed in the lightnings which his hand allayed;<br/>And Washington, the tyrant-tamer, wake,<br/>To bid us blush for these old chains, or break.<br/>But _who_ compose this Senate of the few<br/>That should redeem the many? _Who_ renew<br/>This consecrated name, till now assigned<br/>To councils held to benefit mankind?<br/>Who now assemble at the holy call?<br/>The blest Alliance, which says three are all!<br/>An earthly Trinity! which wears the shape<br/>Of Heaven's, as man is mimicked by the ape.<br/>A pious Unity! in purpose one--<br/>To melt three fools to a Napoleon.<br/>Why, Egypt's Gods were rational to these;<br/>Their dogs and oxen knew their own degrees,<br/>And, quiet in their kennel or their shed,<br/>Cared little, so that they were duly fed;<br/>But these, more hungry, must have something more--<br/>The power to bark and bite, to toss and gore.<br/>Ah, how much happier were good √Üsop's frogs<br/>Than we! for ours are animated logs,<br/>With ponderous malice swaying to and fro,<br/>And crushing nations with a stupid blow;<br/>All dully anxious to leave little work<br/>Unto the revolutionary stork.<br/><br/>Thrice blest Verona! since the holy three<br/>With their imperial presence shine on thee!<br/>Honoured by them, thy treacherous site forgets<br/>The vaunted tomb of "all the Capulets!"<br/>Thy Scaligers--for what was "Dog the Great,"<br/>"Can Grande," (which I venture to translate,)<br/>To these sublimer pugs? Thy poet too,<br/>Catullus, whose old laurels yield to new;<br/>Thine amphitheatre, where Romans sate;<br/>And Dante's exile sheltered by thy gate;<br/>Thy good old man, whose world was all within<br/>Thy wall, nor knew the country held him in;<br/>Would that the royal guests it girds about<br/>Were so far like, as never to get out!<br/>Aye, shout! inscribe! rear monuments of shame,<br/>To tell Oppression that the world is tame!<br/>Crowd to the theatre with loyal rage,<br/>The comedy is not upon the stage;<br/>The show is rich in ribandry and stars,<br/>Then gaze upon it through thy dungeon bars;<br/>Clap thy permitted palms, kind Italy,<br/>For thus much still thy fettered hands are free!<br/><br/>Resplendent sight! Behold the coxcomb Czar,<br/>The Autocrat of waltzes and of war!<br/>As eager for a plaudit as a realm,<br/>And just as fit for flirting as the helm;<br/>A Calmuck beauty with a Cossack wit,<br/>And generous spirit, when 'tis not frost-bit;<br/>Now half dissolving to a liberal thaw,<br/>But hardened back whene'er the morning's raw;<br/>With no objection to true Liberty,<br/>Except that it would make the nations free.<br/>How well the imperial dandy prates of peace!<br/>How fain, if Greeks would be his slaves, free Greece!<br/>How nobly gave he back the Poles their Diet,<br/>Then told pugnacious Poland to be quiet!<br/>How kindly would he send the mild Ukraine,<br/>With all her pleasant Pulks, to lecture Spain!<br/>How royally show off in proud Madrid<br/>His goodly person, from the South long hid!<br/>A blessing cheaply purchased, the world knows,<br/>By having Muscovites for friends or foes.<br/>Proceed, thou namesake of great Philip's son!<br/>La Harpe, thine Aristotle, beckons on;<br/>And that which Scythia was to him of yore<br/>Find with thy Scythians on Iberia's shore.<br/>Yet think upon, thou somewhat ag√©d youth,<br/>Thy predecessor on the banks of Pruth;<br/>Thou hast to aid thee, should his lot be thine,<br/>Many an old woman, but not Catherine.<br/>Spain, too, hath rocks, and rivers, and defiles--<br/>The Bear may rush into the Lion's toils.<br/>Fatal to Goths are Xeres' sunny fields;<br/>Think'st thou to thee Napoleon's victor yields?<br/>Better reclaim thy deserts, turn thy swords<br/>To ploughshares, shave and wash thy Bashkir hordes,<br/>Redeem thy realms from slavery and the knout,<br/>Than follow headlong in the fatal route,<br/>To infest the clime whose skies and laws are pure<br/>With thy foul legions. Spain wants no manure:<br/>Her soil is fertile, but she feeds no foe:<br/>Her vultures, too, were gorged not long ago;<br/>And wouldst thou furnish them with fresher prey?<br/>Alas! thou wilt not conquer, but purvey.<br/>I am Diogenes, though Russ and Hun<br/>Stand between mine and many a myriad's sun;<br/>But were I not Diogenes, I'd wander<br/>Rather a worm than _such_ an Alexander!<br/>Be slaves who will, the cynic shall be free;<br/>His tub hath tougher walls than Sinop√®:<br/>Still will he hold his lantern up to scan<br/>The face of monarchs for an "honest man."<br/><br/>And what doth Gaul, the all-prolific land<br/>Of _ne plus ultra_ ultras and their band<br/>Of mercenaries? and her noisy chambers<br/>And tribune, which each orator first clambers<br/>Before he finds a voice, and when 'tis found,<br/>Hears "the lie" echo for his answer round?<br/>Our British Commons sometimes deign to "hear!"<br/>A Gallic senate hath more tongue than ear;<br/>Even Constant, their sole master of debate,<br/>Must fight next day his speech to vindicate.<br/>But this costs little to true Franks, who'd rather<br/>Combat than listen, were it to their father.<br/>What is the simple standing of a shot,<br/>To listening long, and interrupting not?<br/>Though this was not the method of old Rome,<br/>When Tully fulmined o'er each vocal dome,<br/>Demosthenes has sanctioned the transaction,<br/>In saying eloquence meant "Action, action!"<br/><br/>But where's the monarch? hath he dined? or yet<br/>Groans beneath indigestion's heavy debt?<br/>Have revolutionary pat√©s risen,<br/>And turned the royal entrails to a prison?<br/>Have discontented movements stirred the troops?<br/>Or have _no_ movements followed traitorous soups?<br/>Have Carbonaro cooks not carbonadoed<br/>Each course enough? or doctors dire dissuaded<br/>Repletion? Ah! in thy dejected looks<br/>I read all France's treason in her cooks!<br/>Good classic Louis! is it, canst thou say,<br/>Desirable to be the "Desir√©?"<br/>Why wouldst thou leave calm Hartwell's green abode,<br/>Apician table, and Horatian ode,<br/>To rule a people who will not be ruled,<br/>And love much rather to be scourged than schooled?<br/>Ah! thine was not the temper or the taste<br/>For thrones; the table sees thee better placed:<br/>A mild Epicurean, formed, at best,<br/>To be a kind host and as good a guest,<br/>To talk of Letters, and to know by heart<br/>One _half_ the Poet's, _all_ the Gourmand's art;<br/>A scholar always, now and then a wit,<br/>And gentle when Digestion may permit;--<br/>But not to govern lands enslaved or free;<br/>The gout was martyrdom enough for thee.<br/><br/>Shall noble Albion pass without a phrase<br/>From a bold Briton in her wonted praise?<br/>"Arts--arms--and George--and glory--and the Isles,<br/>And happy Britain, wealth, and Freedom's smiles,<br/>White cliffs, that held invasion far aloof,<br/>Contented subjects, all alike tax-proof,<br/>Proud Wellington, with eagle beak so curled,<br/>That nose, the hook where he suspends the world!<br/>And Waterloo, and trade, and----(hush! not yet<br/>A syllable of imposts or of debt)----<br/>And ne'er (enough) lamented Castlereagh,<br/>Whose penknife slit a goose-quill t'other day--<br/>And, 'pilots who have weathered every storm'--<br/>(But, no, not even for rhyme's sake, name Reform)."<br/>These are the themes thus sung so oft before,<br/>Methinks we need not sing them any more;<br/>Found in so many volumes far and near,<br/>There's no occasion you should find them here.<br/>Yet something may remain perchance to chime<br/>With reason, and, what's stranger still, with rhyme.<br/>Even this thy genius, Canning! may permit,<br/>Who, bred a statesman, still wast born a wit,<br/>And never, even in that dull House, couldst tame<br/>To unleavened prose thine own poetic flame;<br/>Our last, our best, our only orator,<br/>Even I can praise thee--Tories do no more:<br/>Nay, not so much;--they hate thee, man, because<br/>Thy Spirit less upholds them than it awes.<br/>The hounds will gather to their huntsman's hollo,<br/>And where he leads the duteous pack will follow;<br/>But not for love mistake their yelling cry;<br/>Their yelp for game is not an eulogy;<br/>Less faithful far than the four-footed pack,<br/>A dubious scent would lure the bipeds back.<br/>Thy saddle-girths are not yet quite secure,<br/>Nor royal stallion's feet extremely sure;<br/>The unwieldy old white horse is apt at last<br/>To stumble, kick--and now and then stick fast<br/>With his great Self and Rider in the mud;<br/>But what of that? the animal shows blood.<br/><br/>Alas, the Country! how shall tongue or pen<br/>Bewail her now _un_country gentlemen?<br/>The last to bid the cry of warfare cease,<br/>The first to make a malady of peace.<br/>For what were all these country patriots born?<br/>To hunt--and vote--and raise the price of corn?<br/>But corn, like every mortal thing, must fall,<br/>Kings--Conquerors--and markets most of all.<br/>And must ye fall with every ear of grain?<br/>Why would you trouble Buonapart√©'s reign?<br/>He was your great Triptolemus; his vices<br/>Destroyed but realms, and still maintained your prices;<br/>He amplified to every lord's content<br/>The grand agrarian alchymy, high _rent_.<br/>Why did the tyrant stumble on the Tartars,<br/>And lower wheat to such desponding quarters?<br/>Why did you chain him on yon Isle so lone?<br/>The man was worth much more upon his throne.<br/>True, blood and treasure boundlessly were spilt,<br/>But what of that? the Gaul may bear the guilt;<br/>But bread was high, the farmer paid his way,<br/>And acres told upon the appointed day.<br/>But where is now the goodly audit ale?<br/>The purse-proud tenant, never known to fail?<br/>The farm which never yet was left on hand?<br/>The marsh reclaimed to most improving land?<br/>The impatient hope of the expiring lease?<br/>The doubling rental? What an evil's peace!<br/>In vain the prize excites the ploughman's skill,<br/>In vain the Commons pass their patriot bill;<br/>The _Landed Interest_--(you may understand<br/>The phrase much better leaving out the _land_)--<br/>The land self-interest groans from shore to shore,<br/>For fear that plenty should attain the poor.<br/>Up, up again, ye rents, exalt your notes,<br/>Or else the Ministry will lose their votes,<br/>And patriotism, so delicately nice,<br/>Her loaves will lower to the market price;<br/>For ah! "the loaves and fishes," once so high,<br/>Are gone--their oven closed, their ocean dry,<br/>And nought remains of all the millions spent,<br/>Excepting to grow moderate and content.<br/>They who are not so, _had_ their turn--and turn<br/>About still flows from Fortune's equal urn;<br/>Now let their virtue be its own reward,<br/>And share the blessings which themselves prepared.<br/>See these inglorious Cincinnati swarm,<br/>Farmers of war, dictators of the farm;<br/>_Their_ ploughshare was the sword in hireling hands,<br/>_Their_ fields manured by gore of other lands;<br/>Safe in their barns, these Sabine tillers sent<br/>Their brethren out to battle--why? for rent!<br/>Year after year they voted cent. per cent.<br/>Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions--why?--for rent!<br/>They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant<br/>To die for England--why then live?--for rent!<br/>The peace has made one general malcontent<br/>Of these high-market patriots; war was rent!<br/>Their love of country, millions all mis-spent,<br/>How reconcile? by reconciling rent!<br/>And will they not repay the treasures lent?<br/>No: down with everything, and up with rent!<br/>Their good, ill, health, wealth, joy, or discontent,<br/>Being, end, aim, religion--_rent_--_rent_--_rent_!<br/>Thou sold'st thy birthright, Esau! for a mess;<br/>Thou shouldst have gotten more, or eaten less;<br/>Now thou hast swilled thy pottage, thy demands<br/>Are idle; Israel says the bargain stands.<br/>Such, landlords! was your appetite for war,<br/>And gorged with blood, you grumble at a scar!<br/>What! would they spread their earthquake even o'er cash?<br/>And when land crumbles, bid firm paper crash?<br/>So rent may rise, bid Bank and Nation fall,<br/>And found on 'Change a _Fundling_ Hospital?<br/>Lo, Mother Church, while all religion writhes,<br/>Like Niobe, weeps o'er her offspring--Tithes;<br/>The Prelates go to--where the Saints have gone,<br/>And proud pluralities subside to one;<br/>Church, state, and faction wrestle in the dark,<br/>Tossed by the deluge in their common ark.<br/>Shorn of her bishops, banks, and dividends,<br/>Another Babel soars--but Britain ends.<br/>And why? to pamper the self-seeking wants,<br/>And prop the hill of these agrarian ants.<br/>"Go to these ants, thou sluggard, and be wise;"<br/>Admire their patience through each sacrifice,<br/>Till taught to feel the lesson of their pride,<br/>The price of taxes and of homicide;<br/>Admire their justice, which would fain deny<br/>The debt of nations:--pray _who made it high?_<br/><br/>Or turn to sail between those shifting rocks,<br/>The new Symplegades--the crushing Stocks,<br/>Where Midas might again his wish behold<br/>In real paper or imagined gold.<br/>That magic palace of Alcina shows<br/>More wealth than Britain ever had to lose,<br/>Were all her atoms of unleavened ore,<br/>And all her pebbles from Pactolus' shore.<br/>There Fortune plays, while Rumour holds the stake<br/>And the World trembles to bid brokers break.<br/>How rich is Britain! not indeed in mines,<br/>Or peace or plenty, corn or oil, or wines;<br/>No land of Canaan, full of milk and honey,<br/>Nor (save in paper shekels) ready money:<br/>But let us not to own the truth refuse,<br/>Was ever Christian land so rich in Jews?<br/>Those parted with their teeth to good King John,<br/>And now, ye kings, they kindly draw your own;<br/>All states, all things, all sovereigns they control,<br/>And waft a loan "from Indus to the pole."<br/>The banker--broker--baron--brethren, speed<br/>To aid these bankrupt tyrants in their need.<br/>Nor these alone; Columbia feels no less<br/>Fresh speculations follow each success;<br/>And philanthropic Israel deigns to drain<br/>Her mild per-centage from exhausted Spain.<br/>Not without Abraham's seed can Russia march;<br/>Tis gold, not steel, that rears the conqueror's arch.<br/>Two Jews, a chosen people, can command<br/>In every realm their Scripture-promised land:--<br/>Two Jews, keep down the Romans, and uphold<br/>The accurs√©d Hun, more brutal than of old:<br/>Two Jews,--but not Samaritans--direct<br/>The world, with all the spirit of their sect.<br/>What is the happiness of earth to them?<br/>A congress forms their "New Jerusalem,"<br/>Where baronies and orders both invite--<br/>Oh, holy Abraham! dost thou see the sight?<br/>Thy followers mingling with these royal swine,<br/>Who spit not "on their Jewish gaberdine,"<br/>But honour them as portion of the show--<br/>(Where now, oh Pope! is thy forsaken toe?<br/>Could it not favour Judah with some kicks?<br/>Or has it ceased to "kick against the pricks?")<br/>On Shylock's shore behold them stand afresh,<br/>To cut from Nation's hearts their "pound of flesh."<br/><br/>Strange sight this Congress! destined to unite<br/>All that's incongruous, all that's opposite.<br/>I speak not of the Sovereigns--they're alike,<br/>A common coin as ever mint could strike;<br/>But those who sway the puppets, pull the strings,<br/>Have more of motley than their heavy kings.<br/>Jews, authors, generals, charlatans, combine,<br/>While Europe wonders at the vast design:<br/>There Metternich, power's foremost parasite,<br/>Cajoles; there Wellington forgets to fight;<br/>There Chateaubriand forms new books of martyrs;<br/>And subtle Greeks intrigue for stupid Tartars;<br/>There Montmorenci, the sworn foe to charters,<br/>Turns a diplomatist of great √©clat,<br/>To furnish articles for the "D√©bats;"<br/>Of war so certain--yet not quite so sure<br/>As his dismissal in the "Moniteur."<br/>Alas! how could his cabinet thus err!<br/>Can Peace be worth an ultra-minister?<br/>He falls indeed, perhaps to rise again,<br/>"Almost as quickly as he conquered Spain."<br/><br/>Enough of this--a sight more mournful woos<br/>The averted eye of the reluctant Muse.<br/>The Imperial daughter, the Imperial bride,<br/>The imperial Victim--sacrifice to pride;<br/>The mother of the Hero's hope, the boy,<br/>The young Astyanax of Modern Troy;<br/>The still pale shadow of the loftiest Queen<br/>That Earth has yet to see, or e'er hath seen;<br/>She flits amidst the phantoms of the hour,<br/>The theme of pity, and the wreck of power.<br/>Oh, cruel mockery! Could not Austria spare<br/>A daughter? What did France's widow there?<br/>Her fitter place was by St. Helen's wave,<br/>Her only throne is in Napoleon's grave.<br/>But, no,--she still must hold a petty reign,<br/>Flanked by her formidable chamberlain;<br/>The martial Argus, whose not hundred eyes<br/>Must watch her through these paltry pageantries.<br/>What though she share no more, and shared in vain,<br/>A sway surpassing that of Charlemagne,<br/>Which swept from Moscow to the southern seas!<br/>Yet still she rules the pastoral realm of cheese,<br/>Where Parma views the traveller resort,<br/>To note the trappings of her mimic court.<br/>But she appears! Verona sees her shorn<br/>Of all her beams--while nations gaze and mourn--<br/>Ere yet her husband's ashes have had time<br/>To chill in their inhospitable clime;<br/>(If e'er those awful ashes can grow cold;--<br/>But no,--their embers soon will burst the mould;)<br/>She comes!--the Andromache (but not Racine's,<br/>Nor Homer's,)--Lo! on Pyrrhus' arm she leans!<br/>Yes! the right arm, yet red from Waterloo,<br/>Which cut her lord's half-shattered sceptre through,<br/>Is offered and accepted? Could a slave<br/>Do more? or less?--and _he_ in his new grave!<br/>Her eye--her cheek--betray no inward strife,<br/>And the _Ex_-Empress grows as _Ex_ a wife!<br/>So much for human ties in royal breasts!<br/>Why spare men's feelings, when their own are jests?<br/><br/>But, tired of foreign follies, I turn home,<br/>And sketch the group--the picture's yet to come.<br/>My Muse 'gan weep, but, ere a tear was spilt,<br/>She caught Sir William Curtis in a kilt!<br/>While thronged the chiefs of every Highland clan<br/>To hail their brother, Vich Ian Alderman!<br/>Guildhall grows Gael, and echoes with Erse roar,<br/>While all the Common Council cry "Claymore!"<br/>To see proud Albyn's tartans as a belt<br/>Gird the gross sirloin of a city Celt,<br/>She burst into a laughter so extreme,<br/>That I awoke--and lo! it was _no_ dream!<br/><br/>Here, reader, will we pause:--if there's no harm in<br/>This first--you'll have, perhaps, a second "Carmen."<br/><br/>                   B.
