# üíÆ The Medal by *John Dryden*

<p>
    Of all our antic sights and pageantry<br/>Which English idiots run in crowds to see,<br/>The Polish Medal bears the prize alone;<br/>A monster, more the favourite of the town<br/>Than either fairs or theatres have shown.<br/>Never did art so well with nature strive,<br/>Nor ever idol seemed so much alive;<br/>So like the man, so golden to the sight,<br/>So base within, so counterfeit and light.<br/>One side is filled with title and with face;<br/>And, lest the king should want a regal place,<br/>On the reverse a tower the town surveys,<br/>O'er which our mounting sun his beams displays.<br/>The word, pronounced aloud by shrieval voice,<br/>Loetamur, which in Polish is Rejoice,<br/>The day, month, year, to the great act are joined,<br/>And a new canting holiday designed.<br/>Five days he sate for every cast and look,<br/>Four more days than God to finish Adam took.<br/>But who can tell what essence angels are<br/>Or how long Heaven was making Lucifer?<br/>Oh, could the style that copied every grace<br/>And ploughed such furrows for an eunuch face,<br/>Could it have formed his ever-changing will,<br/>The various piece had tired the graver's skill!<br/>A martial hero first, with early care<br/>Blown, like a pigmy by the winds, to war;<br/>A beardless chief, a rebel ere a man,<br/>So young his hatred to his Prince began.<br/>Next this, (how wildly will ambition steer!)<br/>A vermin wriggling in the usurper's ear,<br/>Bartering his venal wit for sums of gold,<br/>He cast himself into the saint-like mould;<br/>Groaned, sighed, and prayed, while godliness was gain,<br/>The loudest bag-pipe of the squeaking train.<br/>But, as 'tis hard to cheat a juggler's eyes,<br/>His open lewdness he could ne'er disguise.<br/>There split the saint; for hypocritic zeal<br/>Allows no sins but those it can conceal.<br/>Whoring to scandal gives too large a scope;<br/>Saints must not trade, but they may interlope.<br/>The ungodly principle was all the same;<br/>But a gross cheat betrays his partners' game.<br/>Besides, their pace was formal, grave, and slack;<br/>His nimble wit outran the heavy pack.<br/>Yet still he found hs fortune at a stay,<br/>Whole droves of blockheads choking up his way;<br/>They took, but not rewarded, his advice;<br/>Villain and wit exact a double price.<br/>Power was his aim; but thrown from that pretence,<br/>The wretch turned loyal in his own defence,<br/>And malice reconciled him to his Prince.<br/>Him in the anguish of his soul he served,<br/>Rewarded faster still than he deserved.<br/>Behold him now exalted into trust,<br/>His counsels oft convenient, seldom just;<br/>Even in the most sincere advice he gave<br/>He had a grudging still to be a knave.<br/>The frauds he learnt in his fanatic years<br/>Made him uneasy in his lawful gears.<br/>At best, as little honest as he could,<br/>And, like white witches, mischievously good.<br/>To his first bias longingly he leans<br/>And rather would be great by wicked means.<br/>Thus framed for ill, he loosed our triple hold,<br/>(Advice unsafe, precipitous, and bold.)<br/>From hence those tears, that Ilium was our woe:<br/>Who helps a powerful friend forearms a foe.<br/>What wonder if the waves prevail so far,<br/>When he cut down the banks that made the bar?<br/>Seas follow but their nature to invade;<br/>But he by art our native strength betrayed.<br/>So Samson to his foe his force confest,<br/>And to be shorn lay slumbering on her breast.<br/>But when this fatal counsel, found too late,<br/>Exposed its author to the public hate,<br/>When his just sovereign by no impious way<br/>Could be seduced to arbitrary sway,<br/>Forsaken of that hope, he shifts his sail,<br/>Drives down the current with the popular gale,<br/>And shows the fiend confessed without a veil.<br/>He preaches to the crowd that power is lent,<br/>But not conveyed to kingly government,<br/>That claims successive bear no binding force,<br/>That coronation oaths are things of course;<br/>Maintains the multitude can never err,<br/>And sets the people in the papal chair.<br/>The reason's obvious, interest never lies;<br/>The most have still their interest in their eyes,<br/>The power is always theirs, and power is ever wise.<br/>Almighty crowd! thou shortenest all dispute.<br/>Power is thy essence, wit thy attribute!<br/>Nor faith nor reason make thee at a stay,<br/>Thou leapst o'er all eternal truths in thy Pindaric way!<br/>Athens, no doubt, did righteously decide,<br/>When Phocion and when Socrates were tried;<br/>As righteously they did those dooms repent;<br/>Still they were wise, whatever way they went.<br/>Crowds err not, though to both extremes they run;<br/>To kill the father and recall the son.<br/>Some think the fools were most, as times went then,<br/>But now the world's o'erstocked with prudent men.<br/>The common cry is even religion's test;<br/>The Turk's is at Constantinople best,<br/>Idols in India, Popery in Rome,<br/>And our own worship is only true at home,<br/>And true but for the time; 'tis hard to know<br/>How long we please it shall continue so;<br/>This side to-day, and that to-morrow burns;<br/>So all are God Almighties in their turns.<br/>A tempting doctrine, plausible and new;<br/>What fools our fathers were, if this be true!<br/>Who, to destroy the seeds of civil war,<br/>Inherent right in monarchs did declare;<br/>And, that a lawful power might never cease,<br/>Secured succession to secure our peace.<br/>Thus property and sovereign sway at last<br/>In equal balances were justly cast;<br/>But this new Jehu spurs the hot-mounted horse,<br/>Instructs the beast to know his native force,<br/>To take the bit between his teeth and fly<br/>To the next headlong steep of anarchy.<br/>Too happy Engand, if our good we knew,<br/>Would we possess the freedom we pursue!<br/>The lavish government can give no more;<br/>Yet we repine, and plenty makes us poor.<br/>God tried us once; our rebel fathers fought;<br/>He glutted them with all the power they sought,<br/>Till, mastered by their own usurping brave,<br/>The free-born subject sunk into a slave.<br/>We loathe our manna, and we long for quails;<br/>Ah! what is man, when his own wish prevails!<br/>How rash, how swift to plunge himself in ill,<br/>Proud of his power and boundless in his will!<br/>That kings can do no wrong we must believe;<br/>None can they do, and must they all receive?<br/>Help. Heaven, or sadly we shall see an hour<br/>When neither wrong nor right are in their power!<br/>Already they have lost their best defence,<br/>The benefit of laws which they dispense.<br/>No justice to their righteous cause allowed,<br/>But baffled by an arbitrary crowd;<br/>And medals graved, their conquest to record,<br/>The stamp and coin of their adopted lord.<br/><br/>The man who laughed but once, to see an ass<br/>Mumbling to make the cross-grained thistles pass,<br/>Might laugh again to see a jury chaw<br/>The prickles of unpalatable law.<br/>The witnesses that, leech-like lived on blood,<br/>Sucking for them were med'cinally good;<br/>But when they fastened on their festered sore,<br/>Then justice and religion they forswore,<br/>Thus men are raised by factions and decried,<br/>And rogue and saint distinguished by their side;<br/>They rack even Scripture to confess their cause<br/>And plead a call to preach in spite of laws.<br/>But that's no news to the poor injured page,<br/>It has been used as ill in every age,<br/>And is constrained with patience all to take,<br/>For what defence can Greek and Hebrew make?<br/>Happy who can this talking trumpet seize,<br/>They make it speak whatever sense they please!<br/>'Twas framed at first our oracle to inquire;<br/>But since our sects in prophecy grow higher,<br/>The text inspires not them, but they the text inspire.<br/><br/>London, thou great emporium of our isle,<br/>O thou too bounteous, thou too fruitful Nile!<br/>How shall I praise or curse to thy desert,<br/>Or separate thy sound from thy corrupted part?<br/>I called thee Nile; the parallel will stand:<br/>Thy tides of wealth o'erflow the fattened land;<br/>Yet monsters from thy large increase we find<br/>Engendered on the slime thou leavest behind.<br/>Sedition has not wholly seized on thee,<br/>Thy nobler parts are from infection free.<br/>Of Israel's tribes thou hast a numerous band,<br/>But still the Canaanite is in the land.<br/>Thy military chiefs are brave and true,<br/>Nor are thy disenchanted burghers few.<br/>The head is loyal which thy heart commands,<br/>But what's a head with two such gouty hands?<br/>The wise and wealthy love the surest way<br/>And are content to thrive and to obey.<br/>But wisdom is to sloth too great a slave;<br/>None are so busy as the fool and knave.<br/>Those let me curse; what vengeance will they urge,<br/>Whose ordures neither plague nor fire can purge,<br/>Nor sharp experience can to duty bring<br/>Nor angry Heaven nor a forgiving king!<br/>In gospel-phrase their chapmen they betray;<br/>Their shops are dens, the buyer is their prey;<br/>The knack of trades is living on the spoil;<br/>They boast e'en when each other they beguile.<br/>Customs to steal is such a trivial thing<br/>That 'tis their charter to defraud their King.<br/>All hands unite of every jarring sect;<br/>They cheat the country first, and then infect.<br/>They for God's cause their monarchs dare dethrone,<br/>And they'll be sure to make His cause their own.<br/>Whether the plotting Jesuit laid the plan<br/>Of murdering kings, or the French Puritan,<br/>Our sacrilegious sects their guides outgo<br/>And kings and kingly power would murder too.<br/><br/>What means their traitorous combination less,<br/>Too plain to evade, too shameful to confess?<br/>But treason is not owned when 'tis descried;<br/>Successful crimes alone are justified.<br/>The men who no consiracy would find,<br/>Who doubts but, had it taken, they had joined?<br/>Joined in a mutual covenant of defence,<br/>At first without, at last against their Prince?<br/>If sovereign right by sovereign power they scan,<br/>The same bold maxim holds in God and man:<br/>God were not safe; his thunder could they shun,<br/>He should be forced to crown another son.<br/>Thus, when the heir was from the vineyard thrown,<br/>The rich possession was the murderers' own.<br/>In vain to sophistry they have recourse;<br/>By proving theirs no plot they prove 'tis worse,<br/>Unmasked rebellion, and audiacious force,<br/>Which, though not actual, yet all eyes may see<br/>'Tis working, in the immediate power to be;<br/>For from pretended grievances they rise<br/>First to dislike and after to dispise;<br/>Then, Cyclop-like, in human flesh to deal,<br/>Chop up a minister at every meal;<br/>Perhaps not wholly to melt down the king,<br/>But clip his regal rights within the ring;<br/>From thence to asssume the power of peace and war<br/>And ease him by degrees of public care.<br/>Yet, to consult his dignity and fame,<br/>He should have leave to exercise the name,<br/>And hold the cards while Commons played the game.<br/>For what can power give more than food and drink,<br/>To live at ease and not be bound to think?<br/>These are the cooler methods of their crime,<br/>But their hot zealots think 'tis loss of time;<br/>On utmost bounds of loyalty they stand,<br/>And grin and whet like a Croatian band<br/>That waits impatient for the last command:<br/>Thus outlaws open villainy maintain;<br/>They steal not, but in squadrons scour the plain;<br/>And if their power the passengers subdue,<br/>The most most have right, the wrong is in the few.<br/>Such impious axioms foolishly they show,<br/>For in some soils Republics will not grow:<br/>Our temperate Isle will no extremes sustain<br/>Of popular sway or arbitrary reign:<br/>But slides between them both into the best,<br/>Secure in freedom, in a monarch blest.<br/>And, though the climate, vexed with various winds,<br/>Works through our yielding bodies on our minds,<br/>The wholesome tempest purges what it breeds<br/>To recommend the calmness that succeeds.<br/><br/>But thou, the pander of the people's hearts,<br/>(O crooked soul and serpentine in arts!)...<br/>What curses on thy blasted name will fall,<br/>Which age to age their legacy shall call,<br/>For all must curse the woes that must descend on all!<br/>Religion thou hast none: thy mercury<br/>Has passed through every sect, or theirs through thee.<br/>But what thou givest, that venom still remains,<br/>And the poxed nation feels thee in their brains.<br/>What else inspires the tongues and swells the breasts<br/>Of all thy bellowing renegado priests,<br/>That preach up thee for God, dispense thy laws,<br/>And with thy stum ferment their fainting cause,<br/>Fresh fumes of madness raise, and toil and sweat,<br/>To make the formidable cripple great?<br/>Yet should thy crimes succeed, should lawless power<br/>Compass those ends thy greedy hopes devour,<br/>Thy canting friends thy mortal foes would be,<br/>Thy god and theirs will never long agree;<br/>For thine, if thou hast any, must be one<br/>That lets the world and human kind alone;<br/>A jolly god that passes hours too well<br/>To promise Heaven or threaten us with Hell,<br/>That unconcerned can at rebellion sit<br/>And wink at crimes he did himself commit.<br/>A tyrant theirs; the heaven their priesthood paints<br/>A conventicle of gloomy sullen saints;<br/>A heaven, like Bedlam, slovenly and sad,<br/>Foredoomed for souls with false religion mad.<br/><br/>Without a vision poets can foreshow<br/>What all but fools by common sense may know:<br/>If true succession from our Isle should fail,<br/>And crowds profane with impious arms prevail,<br/>Not thou nor those thy factious arts engage<br/>Shall reap that harvest of rebellious rage,<br/>With which thou flatterest thy decrepit age.<br/>The swelling poison of the several sects,<br/>Which, wanting vent, the nation's health infects,<br/>Shall burst its bag; and fighting out their way,<br/>The various venoms on each other prey.<br/>The Presbyter, puffed up with spiritual pride,<br/>Shall on the necks of the lewd nobles ride,<br/>His brethren damn, the civil power defy,<br/>And parcel out republic prelacy.<br/>But short shall be his reign; his rigid yoke<br/>And tyrant power will puny sects provoke,<br/>And frogs, and toads, and all the tadpole train<br/>Will croak to Heaven for help from this devouring crane.<br/>The cut-throat sword and clamorous gown shall jar<br/>In sharing their ill-gotten spoils of war;<br/>Chiefs shall be grudged the part which they pretend;<br/>Lords envy lords, and friends with every friend<br/>About their impious merit shall contend.<br/>The surly Commons shall respect deny<br/>And justle peerage out with property.<br/>Their General either shall his trust betray<br/>And force the crowd to arbitrary sway,<br/>Or they, suspecting his ambitious aim,<br/>In hate of kings shall cast anew the frame<br/>And thrust out Collatine that bore their name.<br/><br/>Thus inborn broils the factions would engage,<br/>Or wars of exiled heirs, or foreign rage,<br/>Till halting vengeance overtook our age,<br/>And our wild labours, wearied into rest,<br/>Reclined us on a rightful monarch's breast.<br/><br/>"Pudet hoec opprobria vobis<br/>Et dici potuisse et non potuisse refelli."
