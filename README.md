  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Don Juan by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    FRAGMENT ON THE BACK OF THE MS. OF CANTO I.<br/><br/>I WOULD to Heaven that I were so much clay,<br/>  As I am blood, bone, marrow, passion, feeling--<br/>Because at least the past were passed away,<br/>  And for the future--(but I write this reeling,<br/>Having got drunk exceedingly to-day,<br/>  So that I seem to stand upon the ceiling)<br/>I say--the future is a serious matter--<br/>And so--for God's sake--hock and soda-water!<br/><br/>DEDICATION.<br/><br/>BOB SOUTHEY! You're a poet--Poet-laureate,<br/>  And representative of all the race;<br/>Although 't is true that you turned out a Tory at<br/>  Last,--yours has lately been a common case;<br/>And now, my Epic Renegade! what are ye at?<br/>  With all the Lakers, in and out of place?<br/>A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye<br/>Like "four and twenty Blackbirds in a pye;<br/><br/>"Which pye being opened they began to sing,"<br/>  (This old song and new simile holds good),<br/>"A dainty dish to set before the King,"<br/>  Or Regent, who admires such kind of food;--<br/>And Coleridge, too, has lately taken wing,<br/>  But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,--<br/>Explaining Metaphysics to the nation--<br/>I wish he would explain his Explanation.<br/><br/>You, Bob! are rather insolent, you know,<br/>  At being disappointed in your wish<br/>To supersede all warblers here below,<br/>  And be the only Blackbird in the dish;<br/>And then you overstrain yourself, or so,<br/>  And tumble downward like the flying fish<br/>Gasping on deck, because you soar too high, Bob,<br/>And fall, for lack of moisture, quite a-dry, Bob!<br/><br/>And Wordsworth, in a rather long "Excursion,"<br/>  (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages),<br/>Has given a sample from the vasty version<br/>  Of his new system to perplex the sages;<br/>'T is poetry-at least by his assertion,<br/>  And may appear so when the dog-star rages--<br/>And he who understands it would be able<br/>To add a story to the Tower of Babel.<br/><br/>You--Gentlemen! by dint of long seclusion<br/>  From better company, have kept your own<br/>At Keswick, and, through still continued fusion<br/>  Of one another's minds, at last have grown<br/>To deem as a most logical conclusion,<br/>  That Poesy has wreaths for you alone:<br/>There is a narrowness in such a notion,<br/>Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for Ocean.<br/><br/>I would not imitate the petty thought,<br/>  Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,<br/>For all the glory your conversion brought,<br/>  Since gold alone should not have been its price.<br/>You have your salary; was 't for that you wrought?<br/>  And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.<br/>You're shabby fellows--true--but poets still,<br/>And duly seated on the Immortal Hill.<br/><br/>Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows--<br/>  Perhaps some virtuous blushes;--let them go--<br/>To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs--<br/>  And for the fame you would engross below,<br/>The field is universal, and allows<br/>  Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow:<br/>Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe, will try<br/>'Gainst you the question with posterity.<br/><br/>For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,<br/>  Contend not with you on the wing√©d steed,<br/>I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,<br/>  The fame you envy, and the skill you need;<br/>And, recollect, a poet nothing loses<br/>  In giving to his brethren their full meed<br/>Of merit--and complaint of present days<br/>Is not the certain path to future praise.<br/><br/>He that reserves his laurels for posterity<br/>  (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)<br/>Has generally no great crop to spare it, he<br/>  Being only injured by his own assertion;<br/>And although here and there some glorious rarity<br/>  Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,<br/>The major part of such appellants go<br/>To--God knows where--for no one else can know.<br/><br/>If, fallen in evil days on evil tongues,<br/>  Milton appealed to the Avenger, Time,<br/>If Time, the Avenger, execrates his wrongs,<br/>  And makes the word "Miltonic" mean "_Sublime_,"<br/>_He_ deigned not to belie his soul in songs,<br/>  Nor turn his very talent to a crime;<br/>_He_ did not loathe the Sire to laud the Son,<br/>But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.<br/><br/>Think'st thou, could he--the blind Old Man--arise<br/>  Like Samuel from the grave, to freeze once more<br/>The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,<br/>  Or be alive again--again all hoar<br/>With time and trials, and those helpless eyes,<br/>  And heartless daughters--worn--and pale--and poor;<br/>Would _he_ adore a sultan? _he_ obey<br/>The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?<br/><br/>Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!<br/>  Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,<br/>And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,<br/>  Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,<br/>The vulgarest tool that Tyranny could want,<br/>  With just enough of talent, and no more,<br/>To lengthen fetters by another fixed,<br/>And offer poison long already mixed.<br/><br/>An orator of such set trash of phrase<br/>  Ineffably--legitimately vile,<br/>That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,<br/>  Nor foes--all nations--condescend to smile,--<br/>Nor even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze<br/>  From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,<br/>That turns and turns to give the world a notion<br/>Of endless torments and perpetual motion.<br/><br/>A bungler even in its disgusting trade,<br/>  And botching, patching, leaving still behind<br/>Something of which its masters are afraid--<br/>  States to be curbed, and thoughts to be confined,<br/>Conspiracy or Congress to be made--<br/>  Cobbling at manacles for all mankind--<br/>A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,<br/>With God and Man's abhorrence for its gains.<br/><br/>If we may judge of matter by the mind,<br/>  Emasculated to the marrow _It_<br/>Hath but two objects, how to serve, and bind,<br/>  Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,<br/>Eutropius of its many masters,--blind<br/>  To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,<br/>Fearless--because _no_ feeling dwells in ice,<br/>Its very courage stagnates to a vice.<br/><br/>Where shall I turn me not to _view_ its bonds,<br/>  For I will never _feel_ them?--Italy!<br/>Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds<br/>  Beneath the lie this State-thing breathed o'er thee--<br/>Thy clanking chain, and Erin's yet green wounds,<br/>  Have voices--tongues to cry aloud for me.<br/>Europe has slaves--allies--kings--armies still--<br/>And Southey lives to sing them very ill.<br/><br/>Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate,<br/>  In honest simple verse, this song to you.<br/>And, if in flattering strains I do not predicate,<br/>  'T is that I still retain my "buff and blue;"<br/>My politics as yet are all to educate:<br/>  Apostasy's so fashionable, too,<br/>To keep _one_ creed's a task grown quite Herculean;<br/>Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?<br/><br/>DON JUAN<br/><br/>CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>I WANT a hero: an uncommon want,<br/>  When every year and month sends forth a new one,<br/>Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,<br/>  The age discovers he is not the true one;<br/>Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,<br/>  I'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--<br/>We all have seen him, in the pantomime,<br/>Sent to the Devil somewhat ere his time.<br/><br/>Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,<br/>  Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,<br/>Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,<br/>  And filled their sign-posts then, like Wellesley now;<br/>Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,<br/>  Followers of Fame, "nine farrow" of that sow:<br/>France, too, had Buonapart√© and Dumourier<br/>Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.<br/><br/>Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,<br/>  Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette<br/>Were French, and famous people, as we know;<br/>  And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,<br/>Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,<br/>  With many of the military set,<br/>Exceedingly remarkable at times,<br/>But not at all adapted to my rhymes.<br/><br/>Nelson was once Britannia's god of War,<br/>  And still should be so, but the tide is turned;<br/>There's no more to be said of Trafalgar,<br/>  'T is with our hero quietly inurned;<br/>Because the army's grown more popular,<br/>  At which the naval people are concerned;<br/>Besides, the Prince is all for the land-service.<br/>Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.<br/><br/>Brave men were living before Agamemnon<br/>  And since, exceeding valorous and sage,<br/>A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;<br/>  But then they shone not on the poet's page,<br/>And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,<br/>  But can't find any in the present age<br/>Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);<br/>So, as I said, I'll take my friend Don Juan.<br/><br/>Most epic poets plunge _"in medias res"_<br/>  (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),<br/>And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,<br/>  What went before--by way of episode,<br/>While seated after dinner at his ease,<br/>  Beside his mistress in some soft abode,<br/>Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,<br/>Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.<br/><br/>That is the usual method, but not mine--<br/>  My way is to begin with the beginning;<br/>The regularity of my design<br/>  Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,<br/>And therefore I shall open with a line<br/>  (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning),<br/>Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,<br/>And also of his mother, if you'd rather.<br/><br/>In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,<br/>  Famous for oranges and women,--he<br/>Who has not seen it will be much to pity,<br/>  So says the proverb--and I quite agree;<br/>Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,<br/>  Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;--<br/>Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,<br/>A noble stream, and called the Guadalquivir.<br/><br/>His father's name was Jos√©-_Don_, of course,--<br/>  A true Hidalgo, free from every stain<br/>Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source<br/>  Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;<br/>A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,<br/>  Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,<br/>Than Jos√©, who begot our hero, who<br/>Begot--but that's to come----Well, to renew:<br/><br/>His mother was a learn√©d lady, famed<br/>  For every branch of every science known--<br/>In every Christian language ever named,<br/>  With virtues equalled by her wit alone:<br/>She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,<br/>  And even the good with inward envy groan,<br/>Finding themselves so very much exceeded,<br/>In their own way, by all the things that she did.<br/><br/>Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart<br/>  All Calderon and greater part of Lop√©;<br/>So, that if any actor missed his part,<br/>  She could have served him for the prompter's copy;<br/>For her Feinagle's were an useless art,<br/>  And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he<br/>Could never make a memory so fine as<br/>That which adorned the brain of Donna Inez.<br/><br/>Her favourite science was the mathematical,<br/>  Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,<br/>Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,<br/>  Her serious sayings darkened to sublimity;<br/>In short, in all things she was fairly what I call<br/>  A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,<br/>Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,<br/>And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.<br/><br/>She knew the Latin--that is, "the Lord's prayer,"<br/>  And Greek--the alphabet--I'm nearly sure;<br/>She read some French romances here and there,<br/>  Although her mode of speaking was not pure;<br/>For native Spanish she had no great care,<br/>  At least her conversation was obscure;<br/>Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,<br/>As if she deemed that mystery would ennoble 'em.<br/><br/>She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,<br/>  And said there was analogy between 'em;<br/>She proved it somehow out of sacred song,<br/>  But I must leave the proofs to those who've seen 'em;<br/>But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong,<br/>  And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,<br/>"'T is strange--the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,'<br/>The English always use to govern d--n."<br/><br/>Some women use their tongues--she _looked_ a lecture,<br/>  Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,<br/>An all-in-all sufficient self-director,<br/>  Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,<br/>The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,<br/>  Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--<br/>One sad example more, that "All is vanity,"--<br/>(The jury brought their verdict in "Insanity!")<br/><br/>In short, she was a walking calculation,<br/>  Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,<br/>Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,<br/>  Or "Coelebs' Wife" set out in quest of lovers,<br/>Morality's prim personification,<br/>  In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;<br/>To others' share let "female errors fall,"<br/>For she had not even one--the worst of all.<br/><br/>Oh! she was perfect past all parallel--<br/>  Of any modern female saint's comparison;<br/>So far above the cunning powers of Hell,<br/>  Her Guardian Angel had given up his garrison;<br/>Even her minutest motions went as well<br/>  As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:<br/>In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,<br/>Save thine "incomparable oil," Macassar!<br/><br/>Perfect she was, but as perfection is<br/>  Insipid in this naughty world of ours,<br/>Where our first parents never learned to kiss<br/>  Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,<br/>Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss,<br/>  (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),<br/>Don Jos√©, like a lineal son of Eve,<br/>Went plucking various fruit without her leave.<br/><br/>He was a mortal of the careless kind,<br/>  With no great love for learning, or the learned,<br/>Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,<br/>  And never dreamed his lady was concerned;<br/>The world, as usual, wickedly inclined<br/>  To see a kingdom or a house o'erturned,<br/>Whispered he had a mistress, some said _two_.<br/>But for domestic quarrels _one_ will do.<br/><br/>Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,<br/>  A great opinion of her own good qualities;<br/>Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,<br/>  And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;<br/>But then she had a devil of a spirit,<br/>  And sometimes mixed up fancies with realities,<br/>And let few opportunities escape<br/>Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.<br/><br/>This was an easy matter with a man<br/>  Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;<br/>And even the wisest, do the best they can,<br/>  Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,<br/>That you might "brain them with their lady's fan;"<br/>  And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,<br/>And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,<br/>And why and wherefore no one understands.<br/><br/>'T is pity learn√©d virgins ever wed<br/>  With persons of no sort of education,<br/>Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,<br/>  Grow tired of scientific conversation:<br/>I don't choose to say much upon this head,<br/>  I'm a plain man, and in a single station,<br/>But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,<br/>Inform us truly, have they not hen-pecked you all?<br/><br/>Don Jos√© and his lady quarrelled--_why_,<br/>  Not any of the many could divine,<br/>Though several thousand people chose to try,<br/> 'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;<br/>I loathe that low vice--curiosity;<br/>  But if there's anything in which I shine,<br/>'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,<br/>Not having, of my own, domestic cares.<br/><br/>And so I interfered, and with the best<br/>  Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;<br/>I think the foolish people were possessed,<br/>  For neither of them could I ever find,<br/>Although their porter afterwards confessed--<br/>  But that's no matter, and the worst's behind,<br/>For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,<br/>A pail of housemaid's water unawares.<br/><br/>A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,<br/>  And mischief-making monkey from his birth;<br/>His parents ne'er agreed except in doting<br/>  Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;<br/>Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in<br/>  Their senses, they'd have sent young master forth<br/>To school, or had him soundly whipped at home,<br/>To teach him manners for the time to come.<br/><br/>Don Jos√© and the Donna Inez led<br/>  For some time an unhappy sort of life,<br/>Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;<br/>  They lived respectably as man and wife,<br/>Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,<br/>  And gave no outward signs of inward strife,<br/>Until at length the smothered fire broke out,<br/>And put the business past all kind of doubt.<br/><br/>For Inez called some druggists and physicians,<br/>  And tried to prove her loving lord was _mad_,<br/>But as he had some lucid intermissions,<br/>  She next decided he was only _bad_;<br/>Yet when they asked her for her depositions,<br/>  No sort of explanation could be had,<br/>Save that her duty both to man and God<br/>Required this conduct--which seemed very odd.<br/><br/>She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,<br/>  And opened certain trunks of books and letters,<br/>All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;<br/>  And then she had all Seville for abettors,<br/>Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);<br/>  The hearers of her case became repeaters,<br/>Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,<br/>Some for amusement, others for old grudges.<br/><br/>And then this best and meekest woman bore<br/>  With such serenity her husband's woes,<br/>Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,<br/>  Who saw their spouses killed, and nobly chose<br/>Never to say a word about them more--<br/>  Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,<br/>And saw _his_ agonies with such sublimity,<br/>That all the world exclaimed, "What magnanimity!"<br/><br/>No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,<br/>  Is philosophic in our former friends;<br/>'T is also pleasant to be deemed magnanimous,<br/>  The more so in obtaining our own ends;<br/>And what the lawyers call a _"malus animus"_<br/>  Conduct like this by no means comprehends:<br/>Revenge in person's certainly no virtue,<br/>But then 't is not _my_ fault, if _others_ hurt you.<br/><br/>And if our quarrels should rip up old stories,<br/>  And help them with a lie or two additional,<br/>_I_'m not to blame, as you well know--no more is<br/>  Any one else--they were become traditional;<br/>Besides, their resurrection aids our glories<br/>  By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:<br/>And Science profits by this resurrection--<br/>Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.<br/><br/>Their friends had tried at reconciliation,<br/>  Then their relations, who made matters worse.<br/>('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion<br/>  To whom it may be best to have recourse--<br/>I can't say much for friend or yet relation)<br/>  The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,<br/>But scarce a fee was paid on either side<br/>Before, unluckily, Don Jos√© died.<br/><br/>He died: and most unluckily, because,<br/>  According to all hints I could collect<br/>From Counsel learn√©d in those kinds of laws,<br/>  (Although their talk's obscure and circumspect)<br/>His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;<br/>  A thousand pities also with respect<br/>To public feeling, which on this occasion<br/>Was manifested in a great sensation.<br/><br/>But ah! he died; and buried with him lay<br/>  The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:<br/>His house was sold, his servants sent away,<br/>  A Jew took one of his two mistresses,<br/>A priest the other--at least so they say:<br/>  I asked the doctors after his disease--<br/>He died of the slow fever called the tertian,<br/>And left his widow to her own aversion.<br/><br/>Yet Jos√© was an honourable man,<br/>  That I must say, who knew him very well;<br/>Therefore his frailties I'll no further scan,<br/>  Indeed there were not many more to tell:<br/>And if his passions now and then outran<br/>  Discretion, and were not so peaceable<br/>As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),<br/>He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.<br/><br/>Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,<br/>  Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.<br/>Let's own--since it can do no good on earth--<br/>  It was a trying moment that which found him<br/>Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,<br/>  Where all his household gods lay shivered round him:<br/>No choice was left his feelings or his pride,<br/>Save Death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.<br/><br/>Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir<br/>  To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,<br/>Which, with a long minority and care,<br/>  Promised to turn out well in proper hands:<br/>Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,<br/>  And answered but to Nature's just demands;<br/>An only son left with an only mother<br/>Is brought up much more wisely than another.<br/><br/>Sagest of women, even of widows, she<br/>  Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,<br/>And worthy of the noblest pedigree,<br/>  (His Sire was of Castile, his Dam from Aragon)<br/>Then, for accomplishments of chivalry,<br/>  In case our Lord the King should go to war again,<br/>He learned the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,<br/>And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.<br/><br/>But that which Donna Inez most desired,<br/>  And saw into herself each day before all<br/>The learn√©d tutors whom for him she hired,<br/>  Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral:<br/>Much into all his studies she inquired,<br/>  And so they were submitted first to her, all,<br/>Arts, sciences--no branch was made a mystery<br/>To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.<br/><br/>The languages, especially the dead,<br/>  The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,<br/>The arts, at least all such as could be said<br/>  To be the most remote from common use,<br/>In all these he was much and deeply read:<br/>  But not a page of anything that's loose,<br/>Or hints continuation of the species,<br/>Was ever suffered, lest he should grow vicious.<br/><br/>His classic studies made a little puzzle,<br/>  Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,<br/>Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,<br/>  But never put on pantaloons or bodices;<br/>His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,<br/>  And for their √Üneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,<br/>Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,<br/>For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.<br/><br/>Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,<br/>  Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,<br/>Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,<br/>  I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,<br/>Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn<br/>  Where the Sublime soars forth on wings more ample;<br/>But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one<br/>Beginning with _"Formosum Pastor Corydon."_<br/><br/>Lucretius' irreligion is too strong<br/>  For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;<br/>I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,<br/>  Although no doubt his real intent was good,<br/>For speaking out so plainly in his song,<br/>  So much indeed as to be downright rude;<br/>And then what proper person can be partial<br/>To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?<br/><br/>Juan was taught from out the best edition,<br/>  Expurgated by learned men, who place,<br/>Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,<br/>  The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface<br/>Too much their modest bard by this omission,<br/>  And pitying sore his mutilated case,<br/>They only add them all in an appendix,<br/>Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;<br/><br/>For there we have them all "at one fell swoop,"<br/>  Instead of being scattered through the pages;<br/>They stand forth marshalled in a handsome troop,<br/>  To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,<br/>Till some less rigid editor shall stoop<br/>  To call them back into their separate cages,<br/>Instead of standing staring all together,<br/>Like garden gods--and not so decent either.<br/><br/>The Missal too (it was the family Missal)<br/>  Was ornamented in a sort of way<br/>Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all<br/>  Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,<br/>Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,<br/>  Could turn their optics to the text and pray,<br/>Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother<br/>Kept this herself, and gave her son another.<br/><br/>Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,<br/>  And homilies, and lives of all the saints;<br/>To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,<br/>  He did not take such studies for restraints;<br/>But how Faith is acquired, and then insured,<br/>  So well not one of the aforesaid paints<br/>As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,<br/>Which make the reader envy his transgressions.<br/><br/>This, too, was a sealed book to little Juan--<br/>  I can't but say that his mamma was right,<br/>If such an education was the true one.<br/>  She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;<br/>Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,<br/>  You might be sure she was a perfect fright;<br/>She did this during even her husband's life--<br/>I recommend as much to every wife.<br/><br/>Young Juan waxed in goodliness and grace;<br/>  At six a charming child, and at eleven<br/>With all the promise of as fine a face<br/>  As e'er to Man's maturer growth was given:<br/>He studied steadily, and grew apace,<br/>  And seemed, at least, in the right road to Heaven,<br/>For half his days were passed at church, the other<br/>Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.<br/><br/>At six, I said, he was a charming child,<br/>  At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;<br/>Although in infancy a little wild,<br/>  They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy<br/>His natural spirit not in vain they toiled,<br/>  At least it seemed so; and his mother's joy<br/>Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,<br/>Her young philosopher was grown already.<br/><br/>I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,<br/> But what I say is neither here nor there:<br/>I knew his father well, and have some skill<br/>  In character--but it would not be fair<br/>From sire to son to augur good or ill:<br/>  He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--<br/>But scandal's my aversion--I protest<br/>Against all evil speaking, even in jest.<br/><br/>For my part I say nothing--nothing--but<br/>  _This_ I will say--my reasons are my own--<br/>That if I had an only son to put<br/>  To school (as God be praised that I have none),<br/>'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut<br/>  Him up to learn his catechism alone,<br/>No--no--I'd send him out betimes to college,<br/>For there it was I picked up my own knowledge.<br/><br/>For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,<br/>  Though I acquired--but I pass over _that_,<br/>As well as all the Greek I since have lost:<br/>  I say that there's the place--but "_Verbum sat_,"<br/>I think I picked up too, as well as most,<br/>  Knowledge of matters--but no matter _what_--<br/>I never married--but, I think, I know<br/>That sons should not be educated so.<br/><br/>Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,<br/>  Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seemed<br/>Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;<br/>  And everybody but his mother deemed<br/>Him almost man; but she flew in a rage<br/>  And bit her lips (for else she might have screamed)<br/>If any said so--for to be precocious<br/>Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.<br/><br/>Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all<br/>  Selected for discretion and devotion,<br/>There was the Donna Julia, whom to call<br/>  Pretty were but to give a feeble notion<br/>Of many charms in her as natural<br/>  As sweetness to the flower, or salt to Ocean,<br/>Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid,<br/>(But this last simile is trite and stupid.)<br/><br/>The darkness of her Oriental eye<br/>  Accorded with her Moorish origin;<br/>(Her blood was not all Spanish; by the by,<br/>  In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin;)<br/>When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,<br/>  Boabdil wept: of Donna Julia's kin<br/>Some went to Africa, some stayed in Spain--<br/>Her great great grandmamma chose to remain.<br/><br/>She married (I forget the pedigree)<br/>  With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down<br/>His blood less noble than such blood should be;<br/>  At such alliances his sires would frown,<br/>In that point so precise in each degree<br/>  That they bred _in and in_, as might be shown,<br/>Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,<br/>Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.<br/><br/>This heathenish cross restored the breed again,<br/>  Ruined its blood, but much improved its flesh;<br/>For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain<br/>  Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;<br/>The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:<br/>  But there's a rumour which I fain would hush,<br/>'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma<br/>Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.<br/><br/>However this might be, the race went on<br/>  Improving still through every generation,<br/>Until it centred in an only son,<br/>  Who left an only daughter; my narration<br/>May have suggested that this single one<br/>  Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion<br/>I shall have much to speak about), and she<br/>Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.<br/><br/>Her eye (I'm very fond of handsome eyes)<br/>  Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire<br/>Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise<br/>  Flashed an expression more of pride than ire,<br/>And love than either; and there would arise<br/>  A something in them which was not desire,<br/>But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul<br/>Which struggled through and chastened down the whole.<br/><br/>Her glossy hair was clustered o'er a brow<br/>  Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;<br/>Her eyebrow's shape was like the a√´rial bow,<br/>  Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,<br/>Mounting, at times, to a transparent glow,<br/>  As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,<br/>Possessed an air and grace by no means common:<br/>Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.<br/><br/>Wedded she was some years, and to a man<br/>  Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;<br/>And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE<br/>  'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,<br/>Especially in countries near the sun:<br/>  And now I think on 't, "_mi vien in mente_",<br/>Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue<br/>Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.<br/><br/>'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,<br/>  And all the fault of that indecent sun,<br/>Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,<br/>  But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,<br/>That howsoever people fast and pray,<br/>  The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:<br/>What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,<br/>Is much more common where the climate's sultry,<br/><br/>Happy the nations of the moral North!<br/>  Where all is virtue, and the winter season<br/>Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth<br/>  ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);<br/>Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,<br/>  By laying whate'er sum, in mulct, they please on<br/>The lover, who must pay a handsome price,<br/>Because it is a marketable vice.<br/><br/>Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,<br/>  A man well looking for his years, and who<br/>Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorred:<br/>  They lived together as most people do,<br/>Suffering each other's foibles by accord,<br/>  And not exactly either _one_ or _two_;<br/>Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,<br/>For Jealousy dislikes the world to know it.<br/><br/>Julia was--yet I never could see why--<br/>  With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;<br/>Between their tastes there was small sympathy,<br/>  For not a line had Julia ever penned:<br/>Some people whisper (but, no doubt, they lie,<br/>  For Malice still imputes some private end)<br/>That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,<br/>Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;<br/><br/>And that still keeping up the old connection,<br/>  Which Time had lately rendered much more chaste,<br/>She took his lady also in affection,<br/>  And certainly this course was much the best:<br/>She flattered Julia with her sage protection,<br/>  And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;<br/>And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,<br/>At least she left it a more slender handle.<br/><br/>I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair<br/>  With other people's eyes, or if her own<br/>Discoveries made, but none could be aware<br/>  Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;<br/>Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,<br/>  Indifferent from the first, or callous grown:<br/>I'm really puzzled what to think or say,<br/>She kept her counsel in so close a way.<br/><br/>Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,<br/>  Caressed him often--such a thing might be<br/>Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,<br/>  When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;<br/>But I am not so sure I should have smiled<br/>  When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;<br/>These few short years make wondrous alterations,<br/>Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.<br/><br/>Whate'er the cause might be, they had become<br/>  Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,<br/>Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,<br/>  And much embarrassment in either eye;<br/>There surely will be little doubt with some<br/>  That Donna Julia knew the reason why,<br/>But as for Juan, he had no more notion<br/>Than he who never saw the sea of Ocean.<br/><br/>Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,<br/>  And tremulously gentle her small hand<br/>Withdrew itself from his, but left behind<br/>  A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland<br/>And slight, so very slight, that to the mind<br/>  'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand<br/>Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art<br/>Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.<br/><br/>And if she met him, though she smiled no more,<br/>  She looked a sadness sweeter than her smile,<br/>As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store<br/>  She must not own, but cherished more the while<br/>For that compression in its burning core;<br/>  Even Innocence itself has many a wile,<br/>And will not dare to trust itself with truth,<br/>And Love is taught hypocrisy from youth.<br/><br/>But Passion most dissembles, yet betrays<br/>  Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky<br/>Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays<br/>  Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,<br/>And in whatever aspect it arrays<br/>  Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;<br/>Coldness or Anger, even Disdain or Hate,<br/>Are masks it often wears, and still too late.<br/><br/>Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,<br/>  And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,<br/>And burning blushes, though for no transgression,<br/>  Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;<br/>All these are little preludes to possession,<br/>  Of which young Passion cannot be bereft,<br/>And merely tend to show how greatly Love is<br/>Embarrassed at first starting with a novice.<br/><br/>Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;<br/>  She felt it going, and resolved to make<br/>The noblest efforts for herself and mate,<br/>  For Honour's, Pride's, Religion's, Virtue's sake:<br/>Her resolutions were most truly great,<br/>  And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:<br/>She prayed the Virgin Mary for her grace,<br/>As being the best judge of a lady's case.<br/><br/>She vowed she never would see Juan more,<br/>  And next day paid a visit to his mother,<br/>And looked extremely at the opening door,<br/>  Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;<br/>Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--<br/>  Again it opens, it can be no other,<br/>'T is surely Juan now--No! I'm afraid<br/>That night the Virgin was no further prayed.<br/><br/>She now determined that a virtuous woman<br/>  Should rather face and overcome temptation,<br/>That flight was base and dastardly, and no man<br/>  Should ever give her heart the least sensation,<br/>That is to say, a thought beyond the common<br/>  Preference, that we must feel, upon occasion,<br/>For people who are pleasanter than others,<br/>But then they only seem so many brothers.<br/><br/>And even if by chance--and who can tell?<br/>  The Devil's so very sly--she should discover<br/>That all within was not so very well,<br/>  And, if still free, that such or such a lover<br/>Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell<br/>  Such thoughts, and be the better when they're over;<br/>And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:<br/>I recommend young ladies to make trial.<br/><br/>And, then, there are such things as Love divine,<br/>  Bright and immaculate, unmixed and pure,<br/>Such as the angels think so very fine,<br/>  And matrons, who would be no less secure,<br/>Platonic, perfect, "just such love as mine;"<br/>  Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;<br/>And so I'd have her think, were _I_ the man<br/>On whom her reveries celestial ran.<br/><br/>Such love is innocent, and may exist<br/>  Between young persons without any danger.<br/>A hand may first, and then a lip be kissed;<br/>  For my part, to such doings I'm a stranger,<br/>But _hear_ these freedoms form the utmost list<br/>  Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:<br/>If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,<br/>But not my fault--I tell them all in time.<br/><br/>Love, then, but Love within its proper limits,<br/>  Was Julia's innocent determination<br/>In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its<br/>  Exertion might be useful on occasion;<br/>And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its<br/>  Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion<br/>He might be taught, by Love and her together--<br/>I really don't know what, nor Julia either.<br/><br/>Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced<br/>  In mail of proof--her purity of soul--<br/>She, for the future, of her strength convinced,<br/>  And that her honour was a rock, or mole,<br/>Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed<br/>  With any kind of troublesome control;<br/>But whether Julia to the task was equal<br/>Is that which must be mentioned in the sequel.<br/><br/>Her plan she deemed both innocent and feasible,<br/>  And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen<br/>Not Scandal's fangs could fix on much that's seizable,<br/>  Or if they did so, satisfied to mean<br/>Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--<br/>  A quiet conscience makes one so serene!<br/>Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded<br/>That all the Apostles would have done as they did.<br/><br/>And if in the mean time her husband died,<br/>  But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross<br/>Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sighed)<br/>  Never could she survive that common loss;<br/>But just suppose that moment should betide,<br/>  I only say suppose it--_inter nos_:<br/>(This should be _entre nous_, for Julia thought<br/>In French, but then the rhyme would go for nought.)<br/><br/>I only say, suppose this supposition:<br/>  Juan being then grown up to man's estate<br/>Would fully suit a widow of condition,<br/>  Even seven years hence it would not be too late;<br/>And in the interim (to pursue this vision)<br/>  The mischief, after all, could not be great,<br/>For he would learn the rudiments of Love,<br/>I mean the _seraph_ way of those above.<br/><br/>So much for Julia! Now we'll turn to Juan.<br/>  Poor little fellow! he had no idea<br/>Of his own case, and never hit the true one;<br/>  In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,<br/>He puzzled over what he found a new one,<br/>  But not as yet imagined it could be a<br/>Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,<br/>Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.<br/><br/>Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,<br/>  His home deserted for the lonely wood,<br/>Tormented with a wound he could not know,<br/>  His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:<br/>I'm fond myself of solitude or so,<br/>  But then, I beg it may be understood,<br/>By solitude I mean a Sultan's (not<br/>A Hermit's), with a haram for a grot.<br/><br/>"Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,<br/>  Where Transport and Security entwine,<br/>Here is the Empire of thy perfect bliss,<br/>  And here thou art a God indeed divine."<br/>The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,<br/>  With the exception of the second line,<br/>For that same twining "Transport and Security"<br/>Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.<br/><br/>The Poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals<br/>  To the good sense and senses of mankind,<br/>The very thing which everybody feels,<br/>  As all have found on trial, or may find,<br/>That no one likes to be disturbed at meals<br/>  Or love.--I won't say more about "entwined"<br/>Or "Transport," as we knew all that before,<br/>But beg "Security" will bolt the door.<br/><br/>Young Juan wandered by the glassy brooks,<br/>  Thinking unutterable things; he threw<br/>Himself at length within the leafy nooks<br/>  Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;<br/>There poets find materials for their books,<br/>  And every now and then we read them through,<br/>So that their plan and prosody are eligible,<br/>Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.<br/><br/>He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued<br/>  His self-communion with his own high soul,<br/>Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,<br/>  Had mitigated part, though not the whole<br/>Of its disease; he did the best he could<br/>  With things not very subject to control,<br/>And turned, without perceiving his condition,<br/>Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.<br/><br/>He thought about himself, and the whole earth,<br/>  Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,<br/>And how the deuce they ever could have birth:<br/>  And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,<br/>How many miles the moon might have in girth,<br/>  Of air-balloons, and of the many bars<br/>To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--<br/>And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.<br/><br/>In thoughts like these true Wisdom may discern<br/>  Longings sublime, and aspirations high,<br/>Which some are born with, but the most part learn<br/>  To plague themselves withal, they know not why:<br/>'T was strange that one so young should thus concern<br/>  His brain about the action of the sky;<br/>If _you_ think 't was Philosophy that this did,<br/>I can't help thinking puberty assisted.<br/><br/>He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,<br/>  And heard a voice in all the winds; and then<br/>He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,<br/>  And how the goddesses came down to men:<br/>He missed the pathway, he forgot the hours,<br/>  And when he looked upon his watch again,<br/>He found how much old Time had been a winner--<br/>He also found that he had lost his dinner.<br/><br/>Sometimes he turned to gaze upon his book,<br/>  Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind<br/>Even as the page is rustled while we look,<br/>  So by the poesy of his own mind<br/>Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,<br/>  As if 't were one whereon magicians bind<br/>Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,<br/>According to some good old woman's tale.<br/><br/>Thus would he while his lonely hours away<br/>  Dissatisfied, not knowing what he wanted;<br/>Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,<br/>  Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,<br/>A bosom whereon he his head might lay,<br/>  And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,<br/>With----several other things, which I forget,<br/>Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.<br/><br/>Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,<br/>  Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;<br/>She saw that Juan was not at his ease;<br/>  But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,<br/>Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease<br/>  Her only son with question or surmise;<br/>Whether it was she did not see, or would not,<br/>Or, like all very clever people, could not.<br/><br/>This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;<br/>  For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take<br/>Leave to o'erstep the written rights of Woman,<br/>  And break the----Which commandment is 't they break?<br/>(I have forgot the number, and think no man<br/>  Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake;)<br/>I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,<br/>They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.<br/><br/>A real husband always is suspicious,<br/>  But still no less suspects in the wrong place,<br/>Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,<br/>  Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,<br/>By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;<br/>  The last indeed's infallibly the case:<br/>And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,<br/>He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.<br/><br/>Thus parents also are at times short-sighted:<br/>  Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,<br/>The while the wicked world beholds delighted,<br/>  Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,<br/>Till some confounded escapade has blighted<br/>  The plan of twenty years, and all is over;<br/>And then the mother cries, the father swears,<br/>And wonders why the devil he got heirs.<br/><br/>But Inez was so anxious, and so clear<br/>  Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,<br/>She had some other motive much more near<br/>  For leaving Juan to this new temptation,<br/>But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;<br/>  Perhaps to finish Juan's education,<br/>Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,<br/>In case he thought his wife too great a prize.<br/><br/>It was upon a day, a summer's day;--<br/>  Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,<br/>And so is spring about the end of May;<br/>  The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;<br/>But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,<br/>  And stand convicted of more truth than treason,<br/>That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--<br/>March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.<br/><br/>'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:<br/>  I like to be particular in dates,<br/>Not only of the age, and year, but moon;<br/>  They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates<br/>Change horses, making History change its tune,<br/>  Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,<br/>Leaving at last not much besides chronology,<br/>Excepting the post-obits of theology.<br/><br/>'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour<br/>  Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--<br/>When Julia sate within as pretty a bower<br/>  As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven<br/>Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,<br/>  To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,<br/>With all the trophies of triumphant song--<br/>He won them well, and may he wear them long!<br/><br/>She sate, but not alone; I know not well<br/>  How this same interview had taken place,<br/>And even if I knew, I should not tell--<br/>  People should hold their tongues in any case;<br/>No matter how or why the thing befell,<br/>  But there were she and Juan, face to face--<br/>When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,<br/>But very difficult, to shut their eyes.<br/><br/>How beautiful she looked! her conscious heart<br/>  Glowed in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong:<br/>Oh Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,<br/>  Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong!<br/>How self-deceitful is the sagest part<br/>  Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along!--<br/>The precipice she stood on was immense,<br/>So was her creed in her own innocence.<br/><br/>She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,<br/>  And of the folly of all prudish fears,<br/>Victorious Virtue, and domestic Truth,<br/>  And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:<br/>I wish these last had not occurred, in sooth,<br/>  Because that number rarely much endears,<br/>And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,<br/>Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.<br/><br/>When people say, "I've told you _fifty_ times,"<br/>  They mean to scold, and very often do;<br/>When poets say, "I've written _fifty_ rhymes,"<br/>  They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;<br/>In gangs of _fifty_, thieves commit their crimes;<br/>  At _fifty_ love for love is rare, 't is true,<br/>But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,<br/>A good deal may be bought for _fifty_ Louis.<br/><br/>Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love<br/>  For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,<br/>By all the vows below to Powers above,<br/>  She never would disgrace the ring she wore,<br/>Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;<br/>  And while she pondered this, besides much more,<br/>One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,<br/>Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;<br/><br/>Unconsciously she leaned upon the other,<br/>  Which played within the tangles of her hair;<br/>And to contend with thoughts she could not smother<br/>  She seemed by the distraction of her air.<br/>'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother<br/>  To leave together this imprudent pair,<br/>She who for many years had watched her son so--<br/>I'm very certain _mine_ would not have done so.<br/><br/>The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees<br/>  Gently, but palpably confirmed its grasp,<br/>As if it said, "Detain me, if you please;"<br/>  Yet there's no doubt she only meant to clasp<br/>His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze;<br/>  She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,<br/>Had she imagined such a thing could rouse<br/>A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.<br/><br/>I cannot know what Juan thought of this,<br/>  But what he did, is much what you would do;<br/>His young lip thanked it with a grateful kiss,<br/>  And then, abashed at its own joy, withdrew<br/>In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--<br/>  Love is so very timid when 't is new:<br/>She blushed, and frowned not, but she strove to speak,<br/>And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.<br/><br/>The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:<br/>  The Devil's in the moon for mischief; they<br/>Who called her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon<br/>  Their nomenclature; there is not a day,<br/>The longest, not the twenty-first of June,<br/>  Sees half the business in a wicked way,<br/>On which three single hours of moonshine smile--<br/>And then she looks so modest all the while!<br/><br/>There is a dangerous silence in that hour,<br/>  A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul<br/>To open all itself, without the power<br/>  Of calling wholly back its self-control;<br/>The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,<br/>  Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,<br/>Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws<br/>A loving languor, which is not repose.<br/><br/>And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced<br/>  And half retiring from the glowing arm,<br/>Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;<br/>  Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,<br/>Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;<br/>  But then the situation had its charm,<br/>And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;<br/>I'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.<br/><br/>Oh Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,<br/>  With your confounded fantasies, to more<br/>Immoral conduct by the fancied sway<br/>  Your system feigns o'er the controlless core<br/>Of human hearts, than all the long array<br/>  Of poets and romancers:--You're a bore,<br/>A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,<br/>At best, no better than a go-between.<br/><br/>And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,<br/>  Until too late for useful conversation;<br/>The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,<br/>  I wish, indeed, they had not had occasion;<br/>But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?<br/>  Not that Remorse did not oppose Temptation;<br/>A little still she strove, and much repented,<br/>And whispering "I will ne'er consent"--consented.<br/><br/>'T is said that Xerxes offered a reward<br/>  To those who could invent him a new pleasure:<br/>Methinks the requisition's rather hard,<br/>  And must have cost his Majesty a treasure:<br/>For my part, I'm a moderate-minded bard,<br/>  Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);<br/>I care not for new pleasures, as the old<br/>Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.<br/><br/>Oh Pleasure! you're indeed a pleasant thing,<br/>  Although one must be damned for you, no doubt:<br/>I make a resolution every spring<br/>  Of reformation, ere the year run out,<br/>But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,<br/>  Yet still, I trust, it may be kept throughout:<br/>I'm very sorry, very much ashamed,<br/>And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaimed.<br/><br/>Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--<br/>  Start not! still chaster reader--she'll be nice hence-<br/>Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;<br/>  This liberty is a poetic licence,<br/>Which some irregularity may make<br/>  In the design, and as

day,<br/>Without whose epoch my poetic skill<br/>  For want of facts would all be thrown away),<br/>But keeping Julia and Don Juan still<br/>  In sight, that several months have passed; we'll say<br/>'T was in November, but I'm not so sure<br/>About the day--the era's more obscure.<br/><br/>We'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear<br/>  At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep<br/>The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,<br/>  By distance mellowed, o'er the waters sweep;<br/>'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;<br/>  'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep<br/>From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high<br/>The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.<br/><br/>'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark<br/>  Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home;<br/>'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark<br/>  Our coming, and look brighter when we come;<br/>'T is sweet to be awakened by the lark,<br/>  Or lulled by falling waters; sweet the hum<br/>Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,<br/>The lisp of children, and their earliest words.<br/><br/>Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes<br/>  In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,<br/>Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes<br/>  From civic revelry to rural mirth;<br/>Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,<br/>  Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,<br/>Sweet is revenge--especially to women--<br/>Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.<br/><br/>Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet<br/>  The unexpected death of some old lady,<br/>Or gentleman of seventy years complete,<br/>  Who've made "us youth" wait too--too long already,<br/>For an estate, or cash, or country seat,<br/>  Still breaking, but with stamina so steady,<br/>That all the Israelites are fit to mob its<br/>Next owner for their double-damned post-obits.<br/><br/>'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,<br/>  By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end<br/>To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,<br/>  Particularly with a tiresome friend:<br/>Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;<br/>  Dear is the helpless creature we defend<br/>Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot<br/>We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.<br/><br/>But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,<br/>  Is first and passionate Love--it stands alone,<br/>Like Adam's recollection of his fall;<br/>  The Tree of Knowledge has been plucked--all 's known--<br/>And Life yields nothing further to recall<br/>  Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,<br/>No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven<br/>Fire which Prometheus filched for us from Heaven.<br/><br/>Man's a strange animal, and makes strange use<br/>  Of his own nature,

said the small-pox has gone out of late;<br/>Perhaps it may be followed by the great.<br/><br/>'T is said the great came from America;<br/>  Perhaps it may set out on its return,--<br/>The population

ways, and when<br/>The goal is gained, we die, you know--and then----<br/><br/>What then?--I do not know, no more do you--<br/>  And so good night.--Return we to our story:<br/>'T was in November, when fine days are few,<br/>  And the far mountains wax a little hoary,<br/>And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;<br/>  And the sea dashes round the promontory,<br/>And the loud breaker boils against the rock,<br/>And sober suns must set at five o'clock.<br/><br/>'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;<br/>  No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud<br/>By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright<br/>  With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;<br/>There's something cheerful in that sort of light,<br/>  Even as a summer sky's without a cloud:<br/>I'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,<br/>A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.<br/><br/>'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,<br/>  Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door<br/>Arose a clatter might awake the dead,<br/>  If they had never been awoke before,<br/>And that they have been so we all have read,<br/>  And are to be so, at the least, once more;--<br/>The door was fastened, but with voice and fist<br/>First knocks were heard, then "Madam--Madam--hist!<br/><br/>"For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here's my master,<br/>  With more than half the city at his back--Was<br/>ever heard of such a curst disaster!<br/>  'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!<br/>Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--<br/>  They're on the stair just now, and in a crack<br/>Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--<br/>Surely the window's not so _very_ high!"<br/><br/>By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,<br/>  With torches, friends, and servants in great number;<br/>The major part of them had long been wived,<br/>  And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber<br/>Of any wicked woman, who contrived<br/>  By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:<br/>Examples of this kind are so contagious,<br/>Were _one_ not punished, _all_ would be outrageous.<br/><br/>I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion<br/>  Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;<br/>But for a cavalier of his condition<br/>  It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,<br/>Without a word of previous admonition,<br/>  To hold a levee round his lady's bed,<br/>And summon lackeys, armed with fire and sword,<br/>To prove himself the thing he most abhorred.<br/><br/>Poor Donna Julia! starting as from sleep,<br/>  (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),<br/>Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;<br/>  Her maid, Antonia, who was an adept,<br/>Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,<br/>  As if she had just now from out them crept:<br/>I can't tell why she should take all this trouble<br/>To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.<br/><br/>But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,<br/>  Appeared like two poor harmless women, who<br/>Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,<br/>  Had thought one man might be deterred by two,<br/>And therefore side by side were gently laid,<br/>  Until the hours of absence should run through,<br/>And truant husband should return, and say,<br/>"My dear,--I was the first who came away."<br/><br/>Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,<br/>  "In Heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?<br/>Has madness seized you? would that I had died<br/>  Ere such a monster's victim I had been!<br/>What may this midnight violence betide,<br/>  A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?<br/>Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?<br/>Search, then, the room!"--Alfonso said, "I will."<br/><br/>_He_ searched, _they_ searched, and rummaged everywhere,<br/>  Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,<br/>And found much linen, lace, and several pair<br/>  Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,<br/>With other articles of ladies fair,<br/>  To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:<br/>Arras they pricked and curtains with their swords,<br/>And wounded several shutters, and some boards.<br/><br/>Under the bed they searched, and there they found--<br/>  No matter what--it was not that they sought;<br/>They opened windows, gazing if the ground<br/>  Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;<br/>And then they stared each others' faces round:<br/>  'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,<br/>And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,<br/>Of looking _in_ the bed as well as under.<br/><br/>During this inquisition Julia's tongue<br/>  Was not asleep--"Yes, search and search," she cried,<br/>"Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!<br/>  It was for this that I became a bride!<br/>For this in silence I have suffered long<br/>  A husband like Alfonso at my side;<br/>But now I'll bear no more, nor here remain,<br/>If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.<br/><br/>"Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,<br/>  If ever you indeed deserved the name,<br/>Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--<br/>  Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--<br/>Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore<br/>  For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?<br/>Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,<br/>How dare you think your lady would go on so?<br/><br/>"Is it for this I have disdained to hold<br/>  The common privileges of my sex?<br/>That I have chosen a confessor so old<br/>  And deaf, that any other it would vex,<br/>And never once he has had cause to scold,<br/>  But found my very innocence perplex<br/>So much, he always doubted I was married--<br/>How sorry you will be when I've miscarried!<br/><br/>"Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er<br/>  I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?<br/>Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,<br/>  Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?<br/>Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,<br/>  I favoured none--nay, was almost uncivil?<br/>Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,<br/>Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?<br/><br/>"Did not the Italian _Musico_ Cazzani<br/>  Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?<br/>Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,<br/>  Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?<br/>Were there not also Russians, English, many?<br/>  The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,<br/>And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,<br/>Who killed himself for love (with wine) last year.<br/><br/>"Have I not had two bishops at my feet?<br/>  The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez;<br/>And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?<br/>  I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:<br/>I praise your vast forbearance not to beat<br/>  Me also, since the time so opportune is--<br/>Oh, valiant man! with sword drawn and cocked trigger,<br/>Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?<br/><br/>"Was it for this you took your sudden journey,<br/>  Under pretence of business indispensable<br/>With that sublime of rascals your attorney,<br/>  Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible<br/>Of having played the fool? though both I spurn, he<br/>  Deserves the worst, his conduct's less defensible,<br/>Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,<br/>And not from any love to you nor me.<br/><br/>"If he comes here to take a deposition,<br/>  By all means let the gentleman proceed;<br/>You've made the apartment in a fit condition:--<br/>  There's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--<br/>Let everything be noted with precision,<br/>  I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--<br/>But, as my maid's undressed, pray turn your spies out."<br/>"Oh!" sobbed Antonia, "I could tear their eyes out."<br/><br/>"There is the closet, there the toilet, there<br/>  The antechamber--search them under, over;<br/>There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,<br/>  The chimney--which would really hold a lover.<br/>I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care<br/>  And make no further noise, till you discover<br/>The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--<br/>And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.<br/><br/>"And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown<br/>  Doubt upon me, confusion over all,<br/>Pray have the courtesy to make it known<br/>  _Who_ is the man you search for? how d' ye call<br/>Him? what's his lineage? let him but be shown--<br/>  I hope he's young and handsome--is he tall?<br/>Tell me--and be assured, that since you stain<br/>My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.<br/><br/>"At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,<br/>  At that age he would be too old for slaughter,<br/>Or for so young a husband's jealous fears--<br/>  (Antonia! let me have a glass of water.)<br/>I am ashamed of having shed these tears,<br/>  They are unworthy of my father's daughter;<br/>My mother dreamed not in my natal hour,<br/>That I should fall into a monster's power.<br/><br/>"Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,<br/>  You saw that she was sleeping by my side,<br/>When you broke in upon us with your fellows:<br/>  Look where you please--we've nothing, sir, to hide;<br/>Only another time, I trust, you'll tell us,<br/>  Or for the sake of decency abide<br/>A moment at the door, that we may be<br/>Dressed to receive so much good company.<br/><br/>"And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;<br/>  The little I have said may serve to show<br/>The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er<br/>  The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:--<br/>I leave you to your conscience as before,<br/>  'T will one day ask you _why_ you used me so?<br/>God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!--<br/>Antonia! where's my pocket-handkerchief?"<br/><br/>She ceased, and turned upon her pillow; pale<br/>  She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,<br/>Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,<br/>  Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears<br/>Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail<br/>  To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears<br/>Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,<br/>And louder than her breathing beats her heart.<br/><br/>The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;<br/>  Antonia bustled round the ransacked room,<br/>And, turning up her nose, with looks abused<br/>  Her master, and his myrmidons, of whom<br/>Not one, except the attorney, was amused;<br/>  He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,<br/>So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,<br/>Knowing they must be settled by the laws.<br/><br/>With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,<br/>  Following Antonia's motions here and there,<br/>With much suspicion in his attitude;<br/>  For reputations he had little care;<br/>So that a suit or action were made good,<br/>  Small pity had he for the young and fair,<br/>And ne'er believed in negatives, till these<br/>Were proved by competent false witnesses.<br/><br/>But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,<br/>  And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;<br/>When, after searching in five hundred nooks,<br/>  And treating a young wife with so much rigour,<br/>He gained no point, except some self-rebukes,<br/>  Added to those his lady with such vigour<br/>Had poured upon him for the last half-hour,<br/>Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.<br/><br/>At first he tried to hammer an excuse,<br/>  To which the sole reply was tears, and sobs,<br/>And indications of hysterics, whose<br/>  Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,<br/>Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:<br/>  Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;<br/>He saw too, in perspective, her relations,<br/>And then he tried to muster all his patience.<br/><br/>He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,<br/>  But sage Antonia cut him short before<br/>The anvil of his speech received the hammer,<br/>  With "Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,<br/>Or madam dies."--Alfonso muttered, "D--n her,"<br/>  But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;<br/>He cast a rueful look or two, and did,<br/>He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.<br/><br/>With him retired his _"posse comitatus,"_<br/>  The attorney last, who lingered near the door<br/>Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as<br/>  Antonia let him--not a little sore<br/>At this most strange and unexplained "_hiatus_"<br/>  In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore<br/>An awkward look; as he revolved the case,<br/>The door was fastened in his legal face.<br/><br/>No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh Shame!<br/>  Oh Sin! Oh Sorrow! and Oh Womankind!<br/>How can you do such things and keep your fame,<br/>  Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?<br/>Nothing so dear as an unfilched good name!<br/>  But to proceed--for there is more behind:<br/>With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,<br/>Young Juan slipped, half-smothered, from the bed.<br/><br/>He had been hid--I don't pretend to say<br/>  How, nor can I indeed describe the where--<br/>Young, slender, and packed easily, he lay,<br/>  No doubt, in little compass, round or square;<br/>But pity him I neither must nor may<br/>  His suffocation by that pretty pair;<br/>'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut<br/>With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.<br/><br/>And, secondly, I pity not, because<br/>  He had no business to commit a sin,<br/>Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws;--<br/>  At least 't was rather early to begin,<br/>But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws<br/>  So much as when we call our old debts in<br/>At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,<br/>And find a deuced balance with the Devil.<br/><br/>Of his position I can give no notion:<br/>  'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,<br/>How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,<br/>  Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,<br/>When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,<br/>  And that the medicine answered very well;<br/>Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,<br/>For David lived, but Juan nearly died.<br/><br/>What's to be done? Alfonso will be back<br/>  The moment he has sent his fools away.<br/>Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,<br/>  But no device could be brought into play--<br/>And how to parry the renewed attack?<br/>  Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:<br/>Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,<br/>But pressed her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.<br/><br/>He turned his lip to hers, and with his hand<br/>  Called back the tangles of her wandering hair;<br/>Even then their love they could not all command,<br/>  And half forgot their danger and despair:<br/>Antonia's patience now was at a stand--<br/>  "Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,"<br/>She whispered, in great wrath--"I must deposit<br/>This pretty gentleman within the closet:<br/><br/>"Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--<br/>  _Who_ can have put my master in this mood?<br/>What will become on 't--I'm in such a fright,<br/>  The Devil's in the urchin, and no good--<br/>Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?<br/>  Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?<br/>You'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,<br/>My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.<br/><br/>"Had it but been for a stout cavalier<br/>  Of twenty-five or thirty--(come, make haste)<br/>But for a child, what piece of work is here!<br/>  I really, madam, wonder at your taste--<br/>(Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:<br/>  There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,<br/>And if we can but till the morning keep<br/>Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep.)"<br/><br/>Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,<br/>  Closed the oration of the trusty maid:<br/>She loitered, and he told her to be gone,<br/>  An order somewhat sullenly obeyed;<br/>However, present remedy was none,<br/>  And no great good seemed answered if she staid:<br/>Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,<br/>She snuffed the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.<br/><br/>Alfonso paused a minute--then begun<br/>  Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;<br/>He would not justify what he had done,<br/>  To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;<br/>But there were ample reasons for it, none<br/>  Of which he specified in this his pleading:<br/>His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,<br/>Of rhetoric, which the learned call "_rigmarole._"<br/><br/>Julia said nought; though all the while there rose<br/>  A ready answer, which at once enables<br/>A matron, who her husband's foible knows,<br/>  By a few timely words to turn the tables,<br/>Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--<br/>  Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;<br/>'T is to retort with firmness, and when he<br/>Suspects with _one_, do you reproach with _three_.<br/><br/>Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--<br/>  Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known;<br/>But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--<br/>  But that can't be, as has been often shown,<br/>A lady with apologies abounds;--<br/>  It might be that her silence sprang alone<br/>From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,<br/>To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.<br/><br/>There might be one more motive, which makes two;<br/>  Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--<br/>Mentioned his jealousy, but never who<br/>  Had been the happy lover, he concluded,<br/>Concealed amongst his premises; 't is true,<br/>  His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;<br/>To speak of Inez now were, one may say,<br/>Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.<br/><br/>A hint, in tender cases, is enough;<br/>  Silence is best: besides, there is a _tact_--<br/>(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,<br/>  But it will serve to keep my verse compact)--<br/>Which keeps, when pushed by questions rather rough,<br/>  A lady always distant from the fact:<br/>The charming creatures lie with such a grace,<br/>There's nothing so becoming to the face.<br/><br/>They blush, and we believe them; at least I<br/>  Have always done so; 't is of no great use,<br/>In any case, attempting a reply,<br/>  For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;<br/>And when at length they're out of breath, they sigh,<br/>  And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose<br/>A tear or two, and then we make it up;<br/>And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.<br/><br/>Alfonso closed his speech, and begged her pardon,<br/>  Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,<br/>And laid conditions he thought very hard on,<br/>  Denying several little things he wanted:<br/>He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,<br/>  With useless penitence perplexed and haunted;<br/>Beseeching she no further would refuse,<br/>When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.<br/><br/>A pair of shoes!--what then? not much, if they<br/>  Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these<br/>(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)<br/>  Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,<br/>Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!<br/>  My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze!<br/>Alfonso first examined well their fashion,<br/>And then flew out into another passion.<br/><br/>He left the room for his relinquished sword,<br/>  And Julia instant to the closet flew.<br/>"Fly, Juan, fly! for Heaven's sake--not a word--<br/>  The door is open--you may yet slip through<br/>The passage you so often have explored--<br/>  Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!<br/>Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--<br/>Day has not broke--there's no one in the street."<br/><br/>None can say that this was not good advice,<br/>  The only mischief was, it came too late;<br/>Of all experience 't is the usual price,<br/>  A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:<br/>Juan had reached the room-door in a trice,<br/>  And might have done so by the garden-gate,<br/>But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,<br/>Who threatened death--so Juan knocked him down.<br/><br/>Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;<br/>  Antonia cried out "Rape!" and Julia "Fire!"<br/>But not a servant stirred to aid the fight.<br/>  Alfonso, pommelled to his heart's desire,<br/>Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;<br/>  And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;<br/>His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,<br/>And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.<br/><br/>Alfonso's sword had dropped ere he could draw it,<br/>  And they continued battling hand to hand,<br/>For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;<br/>  His temper not being under great command,<br/>If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,<br/>  Alfonso's days had not been in the land<br/>Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!<br/>And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!<br/><br/>Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,<br/>  And Juan throttled him to get away,<br/>And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;<br/>  At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,<br/>Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,<br/>  And then his only garment quite gave way;<br/>He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,<br/>I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.<br/><br/>Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found<br/>  An awkward spectacle their eyes before;<br/>Antonia in hysterics, Julia swooned,<br/>  Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;<br/>Some half-torn drapery scattered on the ground,<br/>  Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:<br/>Juan the gate gained, turned the key about,<br/>And liking not the inside, locked the out.<br/><br/>Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,<br/>  How Juan, naked, favoured by the night,<br/>Who favours what she should not, found his way,<br/>  And reached his home in an unseemly plight?<br/>The pleasant scandal which arose next day,<br/>  The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,<br/>And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,<br/>Were in the English newspapers, of course.<br/><br/>If you would like to see the whole proceedings,<br/>  The depositions, and the Cause at full,<br/>The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings<br/>  Of Counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,<br/>There's more than one edition, and the readings<br/>  Are various, but they none of them are dull:<br/>The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,<br/>Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.<br/><br/>But Donna Inez, to divert the train<br/>  Of one of the most circulating scandals<br/>That had for centuries been known in Spain,<br/>  At least since the retirement of the Vandals,<br/>First vowed (and never had she vowed in vain)<br/>  To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;<br/>And then, by the advice of some old ladies,<br/>She sent her son to be shipped off from Cadiz.<br/><br/>She had resolved that he should travel through<br/>  All European climes, by land or sea,<br/>To mend his former morals, and get new,<br/>  Especially in France and Italy--<br/>(At least this is the thing most people do.)<br/>  Julia was sent into a convent--she<br/>Grieved--but, perhaps, her feelings may be better<br/>Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--<br/><br/>"They tell me 't is decided you depart:<br/>  'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;<br/>I have no further claim on your young heart,<br/>  Mine is the victim, and would be again:<br/>To love too much has been the only art<br/>  I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain<br/>Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;<br/>My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.<br/><br/>"I loved, I love you, for this love have lost<br/>  State, station, Heaven, Mankind's, my own esteem,<br/>And yet can not regret what it hath cost,<br/>  So dear is still the memory of that dream;<br/>Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,<br/>  None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:<br/>I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--<br/>I've nothing to reproach, or to request.<br/><br/>"Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,<br/>  'T is a Woman's whole existence; Man may range<br/>The Court, Camp, Church, the Vessel, and the Mart;<br/>  Sword, Gown, Gain, Glory, offer in exchange<br/>Pride, Fame, Ambition, to fill up his heart,<br/>  And few there are whom these can not estrange;<br/>Men have all these resources, We but one,<br/>To love again, and be again undone."<br/><br/>"You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,<br/>  Beloved and loving many; all is o'er<br/>For me on earth, except some years to hide<br/>  My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core:<br/>These I could bear, but cannot cast aside<br/>  The passion which still rages as before,--<br/>And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,<br/>That word is idle now--but let it go.<br/><br/>"My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;<br/>  But still I think I can collect my mind;<br/>My blood still rushes where my spirit's set,<br/>  As roll the waves before the settled wind;<br/>My heart is feminine, nor can forget--<br/>  To all, except one image, madly blind;<br/>So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,<br/>As vibrates my fond heart to my fixed soul.<br/><br/>"I have no more to say, but linger still,<br/>  And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,<br/>And yet I may as well the task fulfil,<br/>  My misery can scarce be more complete;<br/>I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;<br/>  Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,<br/>And I must even survive this last adieu,<br/>And bear with life, to love and pray for you!"<br/><br/>This note was written upon gilt-edged paper<br/>  With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new;<br/>Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,<br/>  It trembled as magnetic needles do,<br/>And yet she did not let one tear escape her;<br/>  The seal a sun-flower;

each book containing,<br/>With Love, and War, a heavy gale at sea,<br/>  A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,<br/>New characters; the episodes are three:<br/>  A panoramic view of Hell's in training,<br/>After the style of Virgil and of Homer,<br/>So that my name of Epic's no misnomer.<br/><br/>All these things will be specified in time,<br/>  With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,<br/>The _Vade Mecum_ of the true sublime,<br/>  Which makes so many poets, and some fools:<br/>Prose poets like blank-verse, I'm fond of rhyme,<br/>  Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;<br/>I've got new mythological machinery,<br/>And very handsome supernatural scenery.<br/><br/>There's only one slight difference between<br/>  Me and my epic brethren gone before,<br/>And here the advantage is my own, I ween<br/>  (Not that I have not several merits more,<br/>But this will more peculiarly be seen);<br/>  They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore<br/>Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,<br/>Whereas this story's actually true.<br/><br/>If any person doubt it, I appeal<br/>  To History, Tradition, and to Facts,<br/>To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,<br/>  To plays in five, and operas in three acts;<br/>All these confirm my statement a good deal,<br/>  But that which more completely faith exacts<br/>Is, that myself, and several now in Seville,<br/>_Saw_ Juan's last elopement with the Devil.<br/><br/>If ever I should condescend to prose,<br/>  I'll write poetical commandments, which<br/>Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those<br/>  That went before; in these I shall enrich<br/>My text with many things that no one knows,<br/>  And carry precept to the highest pitch:<br/>I'll call the work "Longinus o'er a Bottle,<br/>Or, Every Poet his _own_ Aristotle."<br/><br/>Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;<br/>  Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;<br/>Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,<br/>  The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:<br/>With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,<br/>  And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:<br/>Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor<br/>Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.<br/><br/>Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,<br/>  His Pegasus, nor anything that's his;<br/>Thou shalt not bear false witness like "the Blues"--<br/>  (There's _one_, at least, is very fond of this);<br/>Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:<br/>  This is true criticism, and you may kiss--<br/>Exactly as you please, or not,--the rod;<br/>But if you don't, I'll lay it on, by G--d!<br/><br/>If any person should presume to assert<br/>  This story is not moral, first, I pray,<br/>That they will not cry out before they're hurt,<br/>  Then that they'll read it o'er again, and say<br/>(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)<br/>  That this is not a moral tale, though gay:<br/>Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show<br/>The very place where wicked people go.<br/><br/>If, after all, there should be some so blind<br/>  To their own good this warning to despise,<br/>Led by some tortuosity of mind,<br/>  Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,<br/>And cry that they "the moral cannot find,"<br/>  I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;<br/>Should captains the remark, or critics, make,<br/>They also lie too--under a mistake.<br/><br/>The public approbation I expect,<br/>  And beg they'll take my word about the moral,<br/>Which I with their amusement will connect<br/>  (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);<br/>Meantime they'll doubtless please to recollect<br/>  My epical pretensions to the laurel:<br/>For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,<br/>I've bribed my Grandmother's Review--the British.<br/><br/>I sent it in a letter to the Editor,<br/>  Who thanked me duly by return of post--<br/>I'm for a handsome article his creditor;<br/>  Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,<br/>And break a promise after having made it her,<br/>  Denying the receipt of what it cost,<br/>And smear his page with gall instead of honey,<br/>All I can say is--that he had the money.<br/><br/>I think that with this holy _new_ alliance<br/>  I may ensure the public, and defy<br/>All other magazines of art or science,<br/>  Daily, or monthly, or three monthly;

and, in short, I<br/>Have squandered my whole summer while 't was May,<br/>  And feel no more the spirit to retort; I<br/>Have spent my life, both interest and principal,<br/>And deem not, what I deemed--my soul invincible.<br/><br/>No more--no more--Oh! never more on me<br/>  The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,<br/>Which out of all the lovely things we see<br/>  Extracts emotions beautiful and new,<br/>Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee.<br/>  Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?<br/>Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power<br/>To double even the sweetness of a flower.<br/><br/>No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,<br/>  Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!<br/>Once all in all, but now a thing apart,<br/>  Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:<br/>The illusion's gone for ever, and thou art<br/>  Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,<br/>And in thy stead I've got a deal of judgment,<br/>Though Heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.<br/><br/>My days of love are over; me no more<br/>  The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,<br/>Can make the fool of which they made before,--<br/>  In short, I must not lead the life I did do;<br/>The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,<br/>  The copious use of claret is forbid too,<br/>So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,<br/>I think I must take up with avarice.<br/><br/>Ambition was my idol, which was broken<br/>  Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;<br/>And the two last have left me many a token<br/>  O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:<br/>Now, like Friar Bacon's Brazen Head, I've spoken,<br/>  "Time is, Time was, Time's past:"--a chymic treasure<br/>Is glittering Youth, which I have spent betimes--<br/>My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.<br/><br/>What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill<br/>  A certain portion of uncertain paper:<br/>Some liken it to climbing up a hill,<br/>  Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;<br/>For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,<br/>  And bards burn what they call their "midnight taper,"<br/>To have, when the original is dust,<br/>A name, a wretched picture and worse bust.<br/><br/>What are the hopes of man?

the World must turn upon its axis,<br/>  And all Mankind turn with it, heads or tails,<br/>And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,<br/>  And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;<br/>The King commands us, and the Doctor quacks us,<br/>  The Priest instructs, and so our life exhales,<br/>A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,<br/>Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.<br/><br/>I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--<br/>  A pretty town, I recollect it well--<br/>'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is,<br/>  (Or was, before Peru learned to rebel),<br/>And such sweet girls!--I mean, such graceful ladies,<br/>  Their very walk would make your bosom swell;<br/>I can't describe it, though so much it strike,<br/>Nor liken it--I never saw the like:<br/><br/>An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb<br/>  New broke, a camelopard, a gazelle,<br/>No--none of these will do;--and then their garb,<br/>  Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell<br/>Upon such things would very near absorb<br/>  A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,<br/>Thank Heaven I've got no metaphor quite ready,<br/>(And so, my sober Muse--come, let's be steady--<br/><br/>Chaste Muse!--well,--if you must, you must)--the veil<br/>  Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,<br/>While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,<br/>  Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land<br/>Of Love! when I forget you, may I fail<br/>  To----say my prayers--but never was there planned<br/>A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,<br/>Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.<br/><br/>But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent<br/>  Her son to Cadiz only to embark;<br/>To stay there had not answered her intent,<br/>  But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--<br/>'T was for a voyage the young man was meant,<br/>  As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,<br/>To wean him from the wickedness of earth,<br/>And send him like a Dove of Promise forth.<br/><br/>Don Juan bade his valet pack his things<br/>  According to direction, then received<br/>A lecture and some money: for four springs<br/>  He was to travel; and though Inez grieved<br/>(As every kind of parting has its stings),<br/>  She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:<br/>A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)<br/>Of good advice--and two or three of credit.<br/><br/>In the mean time, to pass her hours away,<br/>  Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school<br/>For naughty children, who would rather play<br/>  (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;<br/>Infants of three years old were taught that day,<br/>  Dunces were whipped, or set upon a stool:<br/>The great success of Juan's education<br/>Spurred her to teach another generation.<br/><br/>Juan embarked--the ship got under way,<br/>  The wind was fair, the water passing rough;<br/>A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,<br/>  As I, who've crossed it oft, know well enough;<br/>And, standing on the deck, the dashing spray<br/>  Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:<br/>And there he stood to take, and take again,<br/>His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.<br/><br/>I can't but say it is an awkward sight<br/>  To see one's native land receding through<br/>The growing waters; it unmans one quite,<br/>  Especially when life is rather new:<br/>I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,<br/>  But almost every other country's blue,<br/>When gazing on them, mystified by distance,<br/>We enter on our nautical existence.<br/><br/>So Juan stood, bewildered on the deck:<br/>  The wind sung, cordage strained, and sailors swore,<br/>And the ship creaked, the town became a speck,<br/>  From which away so fair and fast they bore.<br/>The best of remedies is a beef-steak<br/>  Against sea-sickness: try it, Sir, before<br/>You sneer, and I assure you this is true,<br/>For I have found it answer--so may you.<br/><br/>Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,<br/>  Beheld his native Spain receding far:<br/>First partings form a lesson hard to learn,<br/>  Even nations feel this when they go to war;<br/>There is a sort of unexpressed concern,<br/>  A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar,<br/>At leaving even the most unpleasant people<br/>And places--one keeps looking at the steeple.<br/><br/>But Juan had got many things to leave,<br/>  His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,<br/>So that he had much better cause to grieve<br/>  Than many persons more advanced in life:<br/>And if we now and then a sigh must heave<br/>  At quitting even those we quit in strife,<br/>No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--<br/>That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.<br/><br/>So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews<br/>  By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:<br/>I'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,<br/>  And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;<br/>Young men should travel, if but to amuse<br/>  Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on<br/>Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,<br/>Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.<br/><br/>And Juan wept, and much he sighed and thought,<br/>  While his salt tears dropped into the salt sea,<br/>"Sweets to the sweet;" (I like so much to quote;<br/>  You must excuse this extract,--'t is where she,<br/>The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought<br/>  Flowers to the grave;) and, sobbing often, he<br/>Reflected on his present situation,<br/>And seriously resolved on reformation.<br/><br/>"Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!" he cried,<br/>  "Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,<br/>But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,<br/>  Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:<br/>Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!<br/>  Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,<br/>Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(here he drew<br/>Her letter out again, and read it through.)<br/><br/>"And oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--<br/>  But that's impossible, and cannot be--<br/>Sooner shall this blue Ocean melt to air,<br/>  Sooner shall Earth resolve itself to sea,<br/>Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!<br/>  Or think of anything, excepting thee;<br/>A mind diseased no remedy can physic--<br/>(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick.)<br/><br/>"Sooner shall Heaven kiss earth--(here he fell sicker)<br/>  Oh, Julia! what is every other woe?--<br/>(For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;<br/>  Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)<br/>Julia, my love!--(you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--<br/>  Oh, Julia!--(this curst vessel pitches so)--<br/>Belov√©d Julia, hear me still beseeching!"<br/>(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)<br/><br/>He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,<br/>  Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,<br/>Beyond the best apothecary's art,<br/>  The loss of Love, the treachery of friends,<br/>Or death of those we dote on, when a part<br/>  Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:<br/>No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,<br/>But the sea acted as a strong emetic.<br/><br/>Love's a capricious power: I've known it hold<br/>  Out through a fever caused by its own heat,<br/>But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,<br/>  And find a quinsy very hard to treat;<br/>Against all noble maladies he's bold,<br/>  But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,<br/>Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,<br/>Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.<br/><br/>But worst of all is nausea, or a pain<br/>  About the lower region of the bowels;<br/>Love, who heroically breathes a vein,<br/>  Shrinks from the application of hot towels,<br/>And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,<br/>  Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else<br/>Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,<br/>Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?<br/><br/>The ship, called the most holy "Trinidada,"<br/>  Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;<br/>For there the Spanish family Moncada<br/>  Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:<br/>They were relations, and for them he had a<br/>  Letter of introduction, which the morn<br/>Of his departure had been sent him by<br/>His Spanish friends for those in Italy.<br/><br/>His suite consisted of three servants and<br/>  A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,<br/>Who several languages did understand,<br/>  But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow<br/>And, rocking in his hammock, longed for land,<br/>  His headache being increased by every billow;<br/>And the waves oozing through the port-hole made<br/>His berth a little damp, and him afraid.<br/><br/>'T was not without some reason, for the wind<br/>  Increased at night, until it blew a gale;<br/>And though 't was not much to a naval mind,<br/>  Some landsmen would have looked a little pale,<br/>For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:<br/>  At sunset they began to take in sail,<br/>For the sky showed it would come on to blow,<br/>And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.<br/><br/>At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift<br/>  Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,<br/>Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,<br/>  Started the stern-post, also shattered the<br/>Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift<br/>  Herself from out her present jeopardy,<br/>The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound<br/>The pumps, and there were four feet water found.<br/><br/>One gang of people instantly was put<br/>  Upon the pumps, and the remainder set<br/>To get up part of the cargo, and what not;<br/>  But they could not come at the leak as yet;<br/>At last they did get at it really, but<br/>  Still their salvation was an even bet:<br/>The water rushed through in a way quite puzzling,<br/>While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,<br/><br/>Into the opening; but all such ingredients<br/>  Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,<br/>Despite of all their efforts and expedients,<br/>  But for the pumps: I'm glad to make them known<br/>To all the brother tars who may have need hence,<br/>  For fifty tons of water were upthrown<br/>By them per hour, and they had all been undone,<br/>But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.<br/><br/>As day advanced the weather seemed to abate,<br/>  And then the leak they reckoned to reduce,<br/>And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet<br/>  Kept two hand--and one chain-pump still in use.<br/>The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late<br/>  A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,<br/>A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--<br/>Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.<br/><br/>There she lay, motionless, and seemed upset;<br/>  The water left the hold, and washed the decks,<br/>And made a scene men do not soon forget;<br/>  For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,<br/>Or any other thing that brings regret<br/>  Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:<br/>Thus drownings are much talked of by the divers,<br/>And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.<br/><br/>Immediately the masts were cut away,<br/>  Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,<br/>The main-mast followed: but the ship still lay<br/>  Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.<br/>Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they<br/>  Eased her at last (although we never meant<br/>To part with all till every hope was blighted),<br/>And then with violence the old ship righted.<br/><br/>It may be easily supposed, while this<br/>  Was going on, some people were unquiet,<br/>That passengers would find it much amiss<br/>  To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;<br/>That even the able seaman, deeming his<br/>  Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,<br/>As upon such occasions tars will ask<br/>For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.<br/><br/>There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms<br/>  As rum and true religion: thus it was,<br/>Some plundered, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,<br/>  The high wind made the treble, and as bass<br/>The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms<br/>  Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:<br/>Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,<br/>Clamoured in chorus to the roaring Ocean.<br/><br/>Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for<br/>  Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,<br/>Got to the spirit-room, and stood before<br/>  It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,<br/>As if Death were more dreadful by his door<br/>  Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,<br/>Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,<br/>Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.<br/><br/>"Give us more grog," they cried, "for it will be<br/>  All one an hour hence." Juan answered, "No!<br/>'T is true that Death awaits both you and me,<br/>  But let us die like men, not sink below<br/>Like brutes:"--and thus his dangerous post kept he,<br/>  And none liked to anticipate the blow;<br/>And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,<br/>Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.<br/><br/>The good old gentleman was quite aghast,<br/>  And made a loud and pious lamentation;<br/>Repented all his sins, and made a last<br/>  Irrevocable vow of reformation;<br/>Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)<br/>  To quit his academic occupation,<br/>In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,<br/>To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.<br/><br/>But now there came a flash of hope once more;<br/>  Day broke, and the wind lulled: the masts were gone<br/>The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,<br/>  The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.<br/>They tried the pumps again, and though before<br/>  Their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown,<br/>A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--<br/>The stronger pumped, the weaker thrummed a sail.<br/><br/>Under the vessel's keel the sail was passed,<br/>  And for the moment it had some effect;<br/>But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,<br/>  Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?<br/>But still 't is best to struggle to the last,<br/>  'T is never too late to be wholly wrecked:<br/>And though 't is true that man can only die once,<br/>'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.<br/><br/>There winds and waves had hurled them, and from thence,<br/>  Without their will, they carried them away;<br/>For they were forced with steering to dispense,<br/>  And never had as yet a quiet day<br/>On which they might repose, or even commence<br/>  A jurymast or rudder, or could say<br/>The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,<br/>Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.<br/><br/>The wind, in fact, perhaps, was rather less,<br/>  But the ship laboured so, they scarce could hope<br/>To weather out much longer; the distress<br/>  Was also great with which they had to cope<br/>For want of water, and their solid mess<br/>  Was scant enough: in vain the telescope<br/>Was used--nor sail nor shore appeared in sight,<br/>Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.<br/><br/>Again the weather threatened,--again blew<br/>  A gale, and in the fore and after hold<br/>Water appeared; yet, though the people knew<br/>  All this, the most were patient, and some bold,<br/>Until the chains and leathers were worn through<br/>  Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she rolled,<br/>At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are<br/>Like human beings during civil war.<br/><br/>Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears<br/>  In his rough eyes, and told the captain, he<br/>Could do no more: he was a man in years,<br/>  And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,<br/>And if he wept at length they were not fears<br/>  That made his eyelids as a woman's be,<br/>But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--<br/>Two things for dying people quite bewildering.<br/><br/>The ship was evidently settling now<br/>  Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,<br/>Some went to prayers again, and made a vow<br/>  Of candles to their saints--but there were none<br/>To pay them with; and some looked o'er the bow;<br/>  Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one<br/>That begged Pedrillo for an absolution,<br/>Who told him to be damned--in his confusion.<br/><br/>Some lashed them in their hammocks; some put on<br/>  Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;<br/>Some cursed the day on which they saw the Sun,<br/>  And gnashed their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;<br/>And others went on as they had begun,<br/>  Getting the boats out, being well aware<br/>That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,<br/>Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.<br/><br/>The worst of all was, that in their condition,<br/>  Having been several days in great distress,<br/>'T was difficult to get out such provision<br/>  As now might render their long suffering less:<br/>Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;<br/>  Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:<br/>Two casks of biscuit, and a keg of butter,<br/>Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.<br/><br/>But in the long-boat they contrived to stow<br/>  Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;<br/>Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;<br/>  Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get<br/>A portion of their beef up from below,<br/>  And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,<br/>But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--<br/>Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.<br/><br/>The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had<br/>  Been stove in the beginning of the gale;<br/>And the long-boat's condition was but bad,<br/>  As there were but two blankets for a sail,<br/>And one oar for a mast, which a young lad<br/>  Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;<br/>And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,<br/>To save one half the people then on board.<br/><br/>'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down<br/>  Over the waste of waters; like a veil,<br/>Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown<br/>  Of one whose hate is masked but to assail.<br/>Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,<br/>  And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,<br/>And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear<br/>Been their familiar, and now Death was here.<br/><br/>Some trial had been making at a raft,<br/>  With little hope in such a rolling sea,<br/>A sort of thing at which one would have laughed,<br/>  If any laughter at such times could be,<br/>Unless with people who too much have quaffed,<br/>  And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,<br/>Half epileptical, and half hysterical:--<br/>Their preservation would have been a miracle.<br/><br/>At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,<br/>  And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,<br/>That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,<br/>  For yet they strove, although of no great use:<br/>There was no light in heaven but a few stars,<br/>  The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;<br/>She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,<br/>And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.<br/><br/>Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--<br/>  Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave,--<br/>Then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,<br/>  As eager to anticipate their grave;<br/>And the sea yawned around her like a hell,<br/>  And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,<br/>Like one who grapples with his enemy,<br/>And strives to strangle him before he die.<br/><br/>And first one universal shriek there rushed,<br/>  Louder than the loud Ocean, like a crash<br/>Of echoing thunder; and then all was hushed,<br/>  Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash<br/>Of billows; but at intervals there gushed,<br/>  Accompanied by a convulsive splash,<br/>A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry<br/>Of some strong swimmer in his agony.<br/><br/>The boats, as stated, had got off before,<br/>  And in them crowded several of the crew;<br/>And yet their present hope was hardly more<br/>  Than what it had been, for so strong it blew<br/>There was slight chance of reaching any shore;<br/>  And then they were too many, though so few--<br/>Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,<br/>Were counted in them when they got afloat.<br/><br/>All the rest perished; near two hundred souls<br/>  Had left their bodies; and what's worse, alas!<br/>When over Catholics the Ocean rolls,<br/>  They must wait several weeks before a mass<br/>Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,<br/>  Because, till people know what's come to pass,<br/>They won't lay out their money on the dead--<br/>It costs three francs for every mass that's said.<br/><br/>Juan got into the long-boat, and there<br/>  Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;<br/>It seemed as if they had exchanged their care,<br/>  For Juan wore the magisterial face<br/>Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair<br/>  Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:<br/>Battista, though, (a name called shortly Tita),<br/>Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.<br/><br/>Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,<br/>  But the same cause, conducive to his loss,<br/>Left him so drunk, he jumped into the wave,<br/>  As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,<br/>And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;<br/>  They could not rescue him although so close,<br/>Because the sea ran higher every minute,<br/>And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.<br/><br/>A small old spaniel,--which had been Don Jos√©'s,<br/>  His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,<br/>For on such things the memory reposes<br/>  With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,<br/>Knowing, (dogs have such intellectual noses!)<br/>  No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;<br/>And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepped<br/>Off threw him in, then after him he leaped.<br/><br/>He also stuffed his money where he could<br/>  About his person, and Pedrillo's too,<br/>Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,<br/>  Not knowing what himself to say, or do,<br/>As every rising wave his dread renewed;<br/>  But Juan, trusting they might still get through,<br/>And deeming there were remedies for any ill,<br/>Thus re-embarked his tutor and his spaniel.<br/><br/>'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,<br/>  That the sail was becalmed between the seas,<br/>Though on the wave's high top too much to set,<br/>  They dared not take it in for all the breeze:<br/>Each sea curled o'er the stern, and kept them wet,<br/>  And made them bale without a moment's ease,<br/>So that themselves as well as hopes were damped,<br/>And the poor little cutter quickly swamped.<br/><br/>Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still<br/>  Kept above water, with an oar for mast,<br/>Two blankets stitched together, answering ill<br/>  Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast;<br/>Though every wave rolled menacing to fill,<br/>  And present peril all before surpassed,<br/>They grieved for those who perished with the cutter,<br/>And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.<br/><br/>The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign<br/>  Of the continuance of the gale: to run<br/>Before the sea until it should grow fine,<br/>  Was all that for the present could be done:<br/>A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine<br/>  Were served out to the people, who begun<br/>To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,<br/>And most of them had little clothes but rags.<br/><br/>They counted thirty, crowded in a space<br/>  Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;<br/>They did their best to modify their case,<br/>  One half sate up, though numbed with the immersion,<br/>While t' other half were laid down in their place,<br/>  At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian<br/>Ague in its cold fit, they filled their boat,<br/>With nothing but the sky for a great coat.<br/><br/>'T is very certain the desire of life<br/>  Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,<br/>When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,<br/>  Survive through very desperate conditions,<br/>Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife<br/>  Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:<br/>Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,<br/>And makes men's misery of alarming brevity.<br/><br/>'T is said that persons living on annuities<br/>  Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,<br/>Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,<br/>  That some, I really think, _do_ never die:<br/>Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,<br/>  And _that's_ their mode of furnishing supply:<br/>In my young days they lent me cash that way,<br/>Which I found very troublesome to pay.<br/><br/>'T is thus with people in an open boat,<br/>  They live upon the love of Life, and bear<br/>More than can be believed, or even thought,<br/>  And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;<br/>And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,<br/>  Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;<br/>She had a curious crew as well as cargo,<br/>Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.<br/><br/>But man is a carnivorous production,<br/>  And must have meals, at least one meal a day;<br/>He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,<br/>  But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;<br/>Although his anatomical construction<br/>  Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,<br/>Your labouring people think, beyond all question,<br/>Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.<br/><br/>And thus it was with this our hapless crew;<br/>  For on the third day there came on a calm,<br/>And though at first their strength it might renew,<br/>  And lying on their weariness like balm,<br/>Lulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue<br/>  Of Ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,<br/>And fell all ravenously on their provision,<br/>Instead of hoarding it with due precision.<br/><br/>The consequence was easily foreseen--<br/>  They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,<br/>In spite of all remonstrances, and then<br/>  On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?<br/>They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!<br/>  And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,<br/>But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,<br/>It would have been more wise to save their victual.<br/><br/>The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,<br/>  And Ocean slumbered like an unweaned child:<br/>The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,<br/>  The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--<br/>With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)<br/>  What could they do? and Hunger's rage grew wild:<br/>So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,<br/>Was killed, and portioned out for present eating.<br/><br/>On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,<br/>  And Juan, who had still refused, because<br/>The creature was his father's dog that died,<br/>  Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,<br/>With some remorse received (though first denied)<br/>  As a great favour one of the fore-paws,<br/>Which he divided with Pedrillo, who<br/>Devoured it, longing for the other too.<br/><br/>The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun<br/>  Blistered and scorched, and, stagnant on the sea,<br/>They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,<br/>  Save in the breeze that came not: savagely<br/>They glared upon each other--all was done,<br/>  Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see<br/>The longings of the cannibal arise<br/>(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.<br/><br/>At length one whispered his companion, who<br/>  Whispered another, and thus it went round,<br/>And then into a hoarser murmur grew,<br/>  An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;<br/>And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,<br/>  'T was but his own, suppressed till now, he found:<br/>And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,<br/>And who should die to be his fellow's food.<br/><br/>But ere they came to this, they that day shared<br/>  Some leathern caps, and what remained of shoes;<br/>And then they looked around them, and despaired,<br/>  And none to be the sacrifice would choose;<br/>At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,<br/>  But of materials that must shock the Muse--<br/>Having no paper, for the want of better,<br/>They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.<br/><br/>The lots were made, and marked, and mixed, and handed,<br/>  In silent horror, and their distribution<br/>Lulled even the savage hunger which demanded,<br/>  Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;<br/>None in particular had sought or planned it,<br/>  'T was Nature gnawed them to this resolution,<br/>By which none were permitted to be neuter--<br/>And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.<br/><br/>He but requested to be bled to death:<br/>  The surgeon had his instruments, and bled<br/>Pedrillo, and so gently ebbed his breath,<br/>  You hardly could perceive when he was dead.<br/>He died as born, a Catholic in faith,<br/>  Like most in the belief in which they're bred,<br/>And first a little crucifix he kissed,<br/>And then held out his jugular and wrist.<br/><br/>The surgeon, as there was no other fee,<br/>  Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;<br/>But being thirstiest at the moment, he<br/>  Preferred a draught from the fast-flowing veins:<br/>Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,<br/>  And such things as the entrails and the brains<br/>Regaled two sharks, who followed o'er the billow--<br/>The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.<br/><br/>The sailors ate him, all save three or four,<br/>  Who were not quite so fond of animal food;<br/>To these was added Juan, who, before<br/>  Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could<br/>Feel now his appetite increased much more;<br/>  'T was not to be expected that he should,<br/>Even in extremity of their disaster,<br/>Dine with them on his pastor and his master.<br/><br/>'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,<br/>  The consequence was awful in the extreme;<br/>For they, who were most ravenous in the act,<br/>  Went raging mad--Lord! how they did blaspheme!<br/>And foam, and roll, with strange convulsions racked,<br/>  Drinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,<br/>Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,<br/>And, with hy√¶na-laughter, died despairing.<br/><br/>Their numbers were much thinned by this infliction,<br/>  And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;<br/>And some of them had lost their recollection,<br/>  Happier than they who still perceived their woes;<br/>But others pondered on a new dissection,<br/>  As if not warned sufficiently by those<br/>Who had already perished, suffering madly,<br/>For having used their appetites so sadly.<br/><br/>And next they thought upon the master's mate,<br/>  As fattest; but he saved himself, because,<br/>Besides being much averse from such a fate,<br/>  There were some other reasons: the first was,<br/>He had been rather indisposed of late;<br/>  And--that which chiefly proved his saving clause--<br/>Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,<br/>By general subscription of the ladies.<br/><br/>Of poor Pedrillo something still remained,<br/>  But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,<br/>And others still their appetites constrained,<br/>  Or but at times a little supper made;<br/>All except Juan, who throughout abstained,<br/>  Chewing a piece of bamboo, and some lead:<br/>At length they caught two Boobies, and a Noddy,<br/>And then they left off eating the dead body.<br/><br/>And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,<br/>  Remember Ugolino condescends<br/>To eat the head of his arch-enemy<br/>  The moment after he politely ends<br/>His tale: if foes be food in Hell, at sea<br/>  'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,<br/>When Shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,<br/>Without being much more horrible than Dante.<br/><br/>And the same night there fell a shower of rain,<br/>  For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth<br/>When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain,<br/>  Men really know not what good water's worth;<br/>If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,<br/>  Or with a famished boat's-crew had your berth,<br/>Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,<br/>You'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.<br/><br/>It poured down torrents, but they were no richer<br/>  Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,<br/>Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,<br/>  And when they deemed its moisture was complete,<br/>They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher<br/>  Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet<br/>As a full pot of porter, to their thinking<br/>They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.<br/><br/>And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,<br/>  Sucked in the moisture, which like nectar streamed;<br/>Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,<br/>  As the rich man's in Hell, who vainly screamed<br/>To beg the beggar, who could not rain back<br/>A drop of dew, when every drop had seemed<br/>To taste of Heaven--If this be true, indeed,<br/>Some Christians have a comfortable creed.<br/><br/>There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,<br/>  And with them their two sons, of whom the one<br/>Was more robust and hardy to the view,<br/>  But he died early; and when he was gone,<br/>His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw<br/>  One glance at him, and said, "Heaven's will be done!<br/>I can do nothing," and he saw him thrown<br/>Into the deep without a tear or groan.<br/><br/>The other father had a weaklier child,<br/>  Of a soft cheek, and aspect delicate;<br/>But the boy bore up long, and with a mild<br/>  And patient spirit held aloof his fate;<br/>Little he said, and now and then he smiled,<br/>  As if to win a part from off the weight<br/>He saw increasing on his father's heart,<br/>With the deep deadly thought, that they must part.<br/><br/>And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised<br/>  His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam<br/>From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,<br/>  And when the wished-for shower at length was come,<br/>And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,<br/>  Brightened, and for a moment seemed to roam,<br/>He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain<br/>Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.<br/><br/>The boy expired--the father held the clay,<br/>  And looked upon it long, and when at last<br/>Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay<br/>  Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,<br/>He watched it wistfully, until away<br/>  'T was borne by the rude wave wherein't was cast;<br/>Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,<br/>And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.<br/><br/>Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through<br/>  The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,<br/>Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;<br/>  And all within its arch appeared to be<br/>Clearer than that without, and its wide hue<br/>  Waxed broad and waving, like a banner free,<br/>Then changed like to a bow that's bent, and then<br/>Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwrecked men.<br/><br/>It changed, of course; a heavenly Chameleon,<br/>  The airy child of vapour and the sun,<br/>Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,<br/>  Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,<br/>Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,<br/>  And blending every colour into one,<br/>Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle<br/>(For sometimes we must box without the muffle).<br/><br/>Our shipwrecked seamen thought it a good omen--<br/>  It is as well to think so, now and then;<br/>'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,<br/>  And may become of great advantage when<br/>Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men<br/>  Had greater need to nerve themselves again<br/>Than these, and so this rainbow looked like Hope--<br/>Quite a celestial Kaleidoscope.<br/><br/>About this time a beautiful white bird,<br/>  Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size<br/>And plumage (probably it might have erred<br/>  Upon its course), passed oft before their eyes,<br/>And tried to perch, although it saw and heard<br/>  The men within the boat, and in this guise<br/>It came and went, and fluttered round them till<br/>Night fell:--this seemed a better omen still.<br/><br/>But in this case I also must remark,<br/>  'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,<br/>Because the tackle of our shattered bark<br/>  Was not so safe for roosting as a church;<br/>And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,<br/>  Returning there from her successful search,<br/>Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,<br/>They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.<br/><br/>With twilight it again came on to blow,<br/>  But not with violence; the stars shone out,<br/>The boat made way; yet now they were so low,<br/>  They knew not where nor what they were about;<br/>Some fancied they saw land, and some said "No!"<br/>  The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--<br/>Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,<br/>And all mistook about the latter once.<br/><br/>As morning broke, the light wind died away,<br/>  When he who had the watch sung out and swore,<br/>If 't was not land that rose with the Sun's ray,<br/>  He wished that land he never might see more;<br/>And the rest rubbed their eyes and saw a bay,<br/>  Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;<br/>For shore it was, and gradually grew<br/>Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.<br/><br/>And then of these some part burst into tears,<br/>  And others, looking with a stupid stare,<br/>Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,<br/>  And seemed as if they had no further care;<br/>While a few prayed--(the first time for some years)--<br/>  And at the bottom of the boat three were<br/>Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,<br/>And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.<br/><br/>The day before, fast sleeping on the water,<br/>  They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,<br/>And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,<br/>Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind<br/>Proved even still a more nutritious matter,<br/>  Because it left encouragement behind:<br/>They thought that in such perils, more than chance<br/>Had sent them this for their deliverance.<br/><br/>The land appeared a high and rocky coast,<br/>  And higher grew the mountains as they drew,<br/>Set by a current, toward it: they were lost<br/>  In various conjectures, for none knew<br/>To what part of the earth they had been tost,<br/>  So changeable had been the winds that blew;<br/>Some thought it was Mount √Ütna, some the highlands<br/>Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.<br/><br/>Meantime the current, with a rising gale,<br/>  Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,<br/>Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:<br/>  Their living freight was now reduced to four,<br/>And three dead, whom their strength could not avail<br/>  To heave into the deep with those before,<br/>Though the two sharks still followed them, and dashed<br/>The spray into their faces as they splashed.<br/><br/>Famine--despair--cold--thirst and heat, had done<br/>  Their work on them by turns, and thinned them to<br/>Such things a mother had not known her son<br/>  Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;<br/>By night chilled, by day scorched, thus one by one<br/>  They perished, until withered to these few,<br/>But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,<br/>In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.<br/><br/>As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen<br/>  Unequal in its aspect here and there,<br/>They felt the freshness of its growing green,<br/>  That waved in forest-tops, and smoothed the air,<br/>And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen<br/>  From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--<br/>Lovely seemed any object that should sweep<br/>Away the vast--salt--dread--eternal Deep.<br/><br/>The shore looked wild, without a trace of man,<br/> And girt by formidable waves; but they<br/>Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,<br/>  Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:<br/>A reef between them also now began<br/>  To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,<br/>But finding no place for their landing better,<br/>They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.<br/><br/>But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,<br/>  Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;<br/>And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,<br/>  Had often turned the art to some account:<br/>A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,<br/>  He could, perhaps, have passed the Hellespont,<br/>As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)<br/>Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.<br/><br/>So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,<br/>  He buoyed his boyish limbs, and strove to ply<br/>With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,<br/>  The beach which lay before him, high and dry:<br/>The greatest danger here was from a shark,<br/>  That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;<br/>As for the other two, they could not swim,<br/>So nobody arrived on shore but him.<br/><br/>Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,<br/>  Which, providentially for him, was washed<br/>Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,<br/>  And the hard wave o'erwhelmed him as 't was dashed<br/>Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore<br/>  The waters beat while he thereto was lashed;<br/>At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he<br/>Rolled on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:<br/><br/>There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung<br/>  Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,<br/>From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,<br/>  Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:<br/>And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,<br/>  Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,<br/>With just enough of life to feel its pain,<br/>And deem that it was saved, perhaps, in vain.<br/><br/>With slow and staggering effort he arose,<br/>  But sunk again upon his bleeding knee<br/>And quivering hand; and then he looked for those<br/>  Who long had been his mates upon the sea;<br/>But none of them appeared to share his woes,<br/>  Save one, a corpse, from out the famished three,<br/>Who died two days before, and now had found<br/>An unknown barren beach for burial ground.<br/><br/>And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,<br/>  And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand<br/>Swam round and round, and all his senses passed:<br/>  He fell upon his side, and his stretched hand<br/>Drooped dripping on the oar (their jury-mast),<br/>  And, like a withered lily, on the land<br/>His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,<br/>As fair a thing as e'er was formed of clay.<br/><br/>How long in his damp trance young Juan lay<br/>  He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,<br/>And Time had nothing more of night nor day<br/>  For his congealing blood, and senses dim;<br/>And how this heavy faintness passed away<br/>  He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,<br/>And tingling vein, seemed throbbing back to life,<br/>For Death, though vanquished, still retired with strife.<br/><br/>His eyes he opened, shut, again unclosed,<br/>  For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought<br/>He still was in the boat, and had but dozed,<br/>  And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,<br/>And wished it Death in which he had reposed,<br/>  And then once more his feelings back were brought,<br/>And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen<br/>A lovely female face of seventeen.<br/><br/>'T was bending close o'er his, and the small mouth<br/>  Seemed almost prying into his for breath;<br/>And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth<br/>  Recalled his answering spirits back from Death:<br/>And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe<br/>  Each pulse to animation, till beneath<br/>Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh<br/>To these kind efforts made a low reply.<br/><br/>Then was the cordial poured, and mantle flung<br/>  Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm<br/>Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;<br/>  And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,<br/>Pillowed his death-like forehead; then she wrung<br/>  His dewy curls, long drenched by every storm;<br/>And watched with eagerness each throb that drew<br/>A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.<br/><br/>And lifting him with care into the cave,<br/>  The gentle girl, and her attendant,--one<br/>Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,<br/>  And more robust of figure,--then begun<br/>To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave<br/>  Light to the rocks that roofed them, which the sun<br/>Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er<br/>She was, appeared distinct, and tall, and fair.<br/><br/>Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,<br/>  That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--<br/>Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were rolled<br/>  In braids behind; and though her stature were<br/>Even of the highest for a female mould,<br/>  They nearly reached her heel; and in her air<br/>There was a something which bespoke command,<br/>As one who was a Lady in the land.<br/><br/>Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes<br/>  Were black as Death, their lashes the same hue,<br/>Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies<br/>  Deepest attraction; for when to the view<br/>Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,<br/>  Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;<br/>'T is as the snake late coiled, who pours his length,<br/>And hurls at once his venom and his strength.<br/><br/>Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye<br/>  Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;<br/>Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh<br/>  Ever to have seen such; for she was one<br/>Fit for the model of a statuary<br/>  (A race of mere impostors, when all's done--<br/>I've seen much finer women, ripe and real,<br/>Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).<br/><br/>I'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just<br/>  One should not rail without a decent cause:<br/>There was an Irish lady, to whose bust<br/>  I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was<br/>A frequent model; and if e'er she must<br/>  Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,<br/>They will destroy a face which mortal thought<br/>Ne'er compassed, nor less mortal chisel wrought.<br/><br/>And such was she, the lady of the cave:<br/>  Her dress was very different from the Spanish,<br/>Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;<br/>  For, as you know, the Spanish women banish<br/>Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave<br/>  Around them (what I hope will never vanish)<br/>The basqui√±a and the mantilla, they<br/>Seem at the same time mystical and gay.<br/><br/>But with our damsel this was not the case:<br/>  Her dress was many-coloured, finely spun;<br/>Her locks curled negligently round her face,<br/>  But through them gold and gems profusely shone:<br/>Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace<br/>  Flowed in her veil, and many a precious stone<br/>Flashed on her little hand; but, what was shocking,<br/>Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.<br/><br/>The other female's dress was not unlike,<br/>  But of inferior materials: she<br/>Had not so many ornaments to strike,<br/>  Her hair had silver only, bound to be<br/>Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,<br/>  Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;<br/>Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes<br/>As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.<br/><br/>And these two tended him, and cheered him both<br/>  With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,<br/>Which are--as I must own--of female growth,<br/>  And have ten thousand delicate inventions:<br/>They made a most superior mess of broth,<br/>  A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,<br/>But the best dish that e'er was cooked since Homer's<br/>Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.<br/><br/>I'll tell you who they were, this female pair,<br/>  Lest they should seem Princesses in disguise;<br/>Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air<br/>  Of clap-trap, which your recent poets prize;<br/>And so, in short, the girls they really were<br/>  They shall appear before your curious eyes,<br/>Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter<br/>Of an old man, who lived upon the water.<br/><br/>A fisherman he had been in his youth,<br/>  And still a sort of fisherman was he;<br/>But other speculations were, in sooth,<br/>  Added to his connection with the sea,<br/>Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:<br/>  A little smuggling, and some piracy,<br/>Left him, at last, the sole of many masters<br/>Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.<br/><br/>A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,<br/>  Like Peter the Apostle, and he fished<br/>For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,<br/>  And sometimes caught as many as he wished;<br/>The cargoes he confiscated, and gain<br/>  He sought in the slave-market too, and dished<br/>Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,<br/>By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.<br/><br/>He was a Greek, and on his isle had built<br/>  (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)<br/>A very handsome house from out his guilt,<br/>  And there he lived exceedingly at ease;<br/>Heaven knows what cash he got, or blood he spilt,<br/>  A sad old fellow was he, if you please;<br/>But this I know, it was a spacious building,<br/>Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.<br/><br/>He had an only daughter, called Haid√©e,<br/>  The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;<br/>Besides, so very beautiful was she,<br/>  Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:<br/>Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree<br/>  She grew to womanhood, and between whiles<br/>Rejected several suitors, just to learn<br/>How to accept a better in his turn.<br/><br/>And walking out upon the beach, below<br/>  The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,<br/>Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--<br/>  Don Juan, almost famished, and half drowned;<br/>But being naked, she was shocked, you know,<br/>  Yet deemed herself in common pity bound,<br/>As far as in her lay, "to take him in,<br/>A stranger" dying--with so white a skin.<br/><br/>But taking him into her father's house<br/>  Was not exactly the best way to save,<br/>But like conveying to the cat the mouse,<br/>  Or people in a trance into their grave;<br/>Because the good old man had so much "ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ",<br/>  Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,<br/>He would have hospitably cured the stranger,<br/>And sold him instantly when out of danger.<br/><br/>And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best<br/>  (A virgin always on her maid relies)<br/>To place him in the cave for present rest:<br/>  And when, at last, he opened his black eyes,<br/>Their charity increased about their guest;<br/>  And their compassion grew to such a size,<br/>It opened half the turnpike-gates to Heaven--<br/>(St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).<br/><br/>They made a fire,--but such a fire as they<br/>  Upon the moment could contrive with such<br/>Materials as were cast up round the bay,--<br/>  Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch<br/>Were nearly tinder, since, so long they lay,<br/>  A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;<br/>But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,<br/>That there was fuel to have furnished twenty.<br/><br/>He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,<br/>  For Haid√©e stripped her sables off to make<br/>His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,<br/>  And warm, in case by chance he should awake,<br/>They also gave a petticoat apiece,<br/>  She and her maid,--and promised by daybreak<br/>To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish<br/>For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.<br/><br/>And thus they left him to his lone repose:<br/>  Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,<br/>Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),<br/>  Just for the present; and in his lulled head<br/>Not even a vision of his former woes<br/>  Throbbed in accurs√©d dreams, which sometimes spread<br/>Unwelcome visions of our former years,<br/>Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.<br/><br/>Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,<br/>  Who smoothed his pillow, as she left the den<br/>Looked back upon him, and a moment stayed,<br/>  And turned, believing that he called again.<br/>He slumbered; yet she thought, at least she said<br/>  (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),<br/>He had pronounced her name--but she forgot<br/>That at this moment Juan knew it not.<br/><br/>And pensive to her father's house she went,<br/>  Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who<br/>Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,<br/>  She being wiser by a year or two:<br/>A year or two's an age when rightly spent,<br/>  And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,<br/>In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge<br/>Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.<br/><br/>The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still<br/>  Fast in his cave, and nothing clashed upon<br/>His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,<br/>  And the young beams of the excluded Sun,<br/>Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;<br/>  And need he had of slumber yet, for none<br/>Had suffered more--his hardships were comparative<br/>To those related in my grand-dad's "Narrative."<br/><br/>Not so Haid√©e: she sadly tossed and tumbled,<br/>  And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er,<br/>Dreamed of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,<br/>  And handsome corpses strewed upon the shore;<br/>And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,<br/>  And called her father's old slaves up, who swore<br/>In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--<br/>They knew not what to think of such a freak.<br/><br/>But up she got, and up she made them get,<br/>  With some pretence about the Sun, that makes<br/>Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;<br/>  And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks<br/>Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet<br/>  With mist, and every bird with him awakes,<br/>And night is flung off like a mourning suit<br/>Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.<br/><br/>I say, the Sun is a most glorious sight,<br/>  I've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late<br/>I have sat up on purpose all the night,<br/>  Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;<br/>And so all ye, who would be in the right<br/>  In health and purse, begin your day to date<br/>From daybreak, and when coffined at fourscore,<br/>Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.<br/><br/>And Haid√©e met the morning face to face;<br/>  Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush<br/>Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race<br/>  From heart to cheek is curbed into a blush,<br/>Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,<br/>  That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,<br/>Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;<br/>Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.<br/><br/>And down the cliff the island virgin came,<br/>  And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,<br/>While the Sun smiled on her with his first flame,<br/>  And young Aurora kissed her lips with dew,<br/>Taking her for a sister; just the same<br/>  Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,<br/>Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,<br/>Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.<br/><br/>And when into the cavern Haid√©e stepped<br/>  All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw<br/>That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;<br/>  And then she stopped, and stood as if in awe<br/>(For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept<br/>  And wrapped him closer, lest the air, too raw,<br/>Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as Death<br/>Bent, with hushed lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.<br/><br/>And thus like to an Angel o'er the dying<br/>  Who die in righteousness, she leaned; and there<br/>All tranquilly the shipwrecked boy was lying,<br/>  As o'er him lay the calm and stirless air:<br/>But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,<br/>  Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair<br/>Must breakfast--and, betimes, lest they should ask it,<br/>She drew out her provision from the basket.<br/><br/>She knew that the best feelings must have victual,<br/>  And that a shipwrecked youth would hungry be;<br/>Besides, being less in love, she yawned a little,<br/>  And felt her veins chilled by the neighbouring sea;<br/>And so, she cooked their breakfast to a tittle;<br/>  I can't say that she gave them any tea,<br/>But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,<br/>With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.<br/><br/>And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and<br/>  The coffee made, would fain have wakened Juan;<br/>But Haid√©e stopped her with her quick small hand,<br/>  And without word, a sign her finger drew on<br/>Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;<br/>  And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,<br/>Because her mistress would not let her break<br/>That sleep which seemed as it would ne'er awake.<br/><br/>For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek<br/>  A purple hectic played like dying day<br/>On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak<br/>  Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,<br/>Where the blue veins looked shadowy, shrunk, and weak;<br/>  And his black curls were dewy with the spray,<br/>Which weighed upon them yet, all damp and salt,<br/>Mixed with the stony vapours of the vault.<br/><br/>And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,<br/>  Hushed as the babe upon its mother's breast,<br/>Drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe,<br/>  Lulled like the depth of Ocean when at rest,<br/>Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,<br/>  Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;<br/>In short, he was a very pretty fellow,<br/>Although his woes had turned him rather yellow.<br/><br/>He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,<br/>  But the fair face which met his eyes forbade<br/>Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain<br/>  Had further sleep a further pleasure made:<br/>For Woman's face was never formed in vain<br/>  For Juan, so that even when he prayed<br/>He turned from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,<br/>To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.<br/><br/>And thus upon his elbow he arose,<br/>  And looked upon the lady, in whose cheek<br/>The pale contended with the purple rose,<br/>  As with an effort she began to speak;<br/>Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,<br/>  Although she told him, in good modern Greek,<br/>With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,<br/>That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.<br/><br/>Now Juan could not understand a word,<br/>  Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,<br/>And her voice was the warble of a bird,<br/>  So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,<br/>That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;<br/>  The sort of sound we echo with a tear,<br/>Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,<br/>Whence Melody descends as from a throne.<br/><br/>And Juan gazed as one who is awoke<br/>  By a distant organ, doubting if he be<br/>Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke<br/>  By the watchman, or some such reality,<br/>Or by one's early valet's curs√©d knock;<br/>  At least it is a heavy sound to me,<br/>Who like a morning slumber--for the night<br/>Shows stars and women in a better light.<br/><br/>And Juan, too, was helped out from his dream,<br/>  Or sleep, or whatsoe'er it was, by feeling<br/>A most prodigious appetite; the steam<br/>  Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing<br/>Upon his senses, and the kindling beam<br/>  Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling,<br/>To stir her viands, made him quite awake<br/>And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.<br/><br/>But beef is rare within these oxless isles;<br/>  Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton,<br/>And, when a holiday upon them smiles,<br/>  A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:<br/>But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,<br/>  For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;<br/>Others are fair and fertile, among which<br/>This, though not large, was one of the most rich.<br/><br/>I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking<br/>  That the old fable of the Minotaur--From<br/>which our modern morals, rightly shrinking,<br/>  Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore<br/>A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking<br/>  The allegory) a mere type, no more,<br/>That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,<br/>To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.<br/><br/>For we all know that English people are<br/>  Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,<br/>Because 't is liquor only, and being far<br/>  From this my subject, has no business here;<br/>We know, too, they are very fond of war,<br/>  A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;<br/>So were the Cretans--from which I infer,<br/>That beef and battles both were owing to her.<br/><br/>But to resume. The languid Juan raised<br/>  His head upon his elbow, and he saw<br/>A sight on which he had not lately gazed,<br/>  As all his latter meals had been quite raw,<br/>Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,<br/>  And, feeling still the famished vulture gnaw,<br/>He fell upon whate'er was offered, like<br/>A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.<br/><br/>He ate, and he was well supplied; and she,<br/>  Who watched him like a mother, would have fed<br/>Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see<br/>  Such appetite in one she had deemed dead:<br/>But Zoe, being older than Haid√©e,<br/>  Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)<br/>That famished people must be slowly nurst,<br/>And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.<br/><br/>And so she took the liberty to state,<br/>  Rather by deeds than words, because the case<br/>Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate<br/>  Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace<br/>The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,<br/>  Unless he wished to die upon the place--<br/>She snatched it, and refused another morsel,<br/>Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.<br/><br/>Next they--he being naked, save a tattered<br/>  Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,<br/>And in the fire his recent rags they scattered,<br/>  And dressed him, for the present, like a Turk,<br/>Or Greek--that is, although it not much mattered,<br/>  Omitting turban, slippers, pistol, dirk,--<br/>They furnished him, entire, except some stitches,<br/>With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.<br/><br/>And then fair Haid√©e tried her tongue at speaking,<br/>  But not a word could Juan comprehend,<br/>Although he listened so that the young Greek in<br/>  Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;<br/>And, as he interrupted not, went eking<br/>  Her speech out to her prot√©g√© and friend,<br/>Till pausing at the last her breath to take,<br/>She saw he did not understand Romaic.<br/><br/>And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,<br/>  And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,<br/>And read (the only book she could) the lines<br/>  Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,<br/>The answer eloquent, where the Soul shines<br/>  And darts in one quick glance a long reply;<br/>And thus in every look she saw expressed<br/>A world of words, and things at which she guessed.<br/><br/>And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,<br/>  And words repeated after her, he took<br/>A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,<br/>  No doubt, less of her language than her look:<br/>As he who studies fervently the skies<br/>  Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,<br/>Thus Juan learned his _alpha beta_ better<br/>From Haid√©e's glance than any graven letter.<br/><br/>'T is pleasing to be schooled in a strange tongue<br/>  By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,<br/>When both the teacher and the taught are young,<br/>  As was the case, at least, where I have been;<br/>They smile so when one's right, and when one's wrong<br/>  They smile still more, and then there intervene<br/>Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--<br/>I learned the little that I know by this:<br/><br/>That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,<br/>  Italian not at all, having no teachers;<br/>Much English I cannot pretend to speak,<br/>  Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,<br/>Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week<br/>  I study, also Blair--the highest reachers<br/>Of eloquence in piety and prose--<br/>I hate your poets, so read none of those.<br/><br/>As for the ladies, I have nought to say,<br/>  A wanderer from the British world of Fashion,<br/>Where I, like other "dogs, have had my day,"<br/>  Like other men, too, may have had my passion--<br/>But that, like other things, has passed away,<br/>  And all her fools whom I _could_ lay the lash on:<br/>Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me<br/>But dreams of what has been, no more to be.<br/><br/>Return we to Don Juan. He begun<br/>  To hear new words, and to repeat them; but<br/>Some feelings, universal as the Sun,<br/>  Were such as could not in his breast be shut<br/>More than within the bosom of a nun:<br/>  He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,<br/>With a young benefactress,--so was she,<br/>Just in the way we very often see.<br/><br/>And every day by daybreak--rather early<br/>  For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--<br/>She came into the cave, but it was merely<br/>  To see her bird reposing in his nest;<br/>And she would softly stir his locks so curly,<br/>  Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,<br/>Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,<br/>As o'er a bed of roses the sweet South.<br/><br/>And every morn his colour freshlier came,<br/>  And every day helped on his convalescence;<br/>'T was well, because health in the human frame<br/>  Is pleasant, besides being true Love's essence,<br/>For health and idleness to Passion's flame<br/>  Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons<br/>Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,<br/>Without whom Venus will not long attack us.<br/><br/>While Venus fills the heart, (without heart really<br/>  Love, though good always, is not quite so good,)<br/>Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--<br/>  For Love must be sustained like flesh and blood,--While<br/>Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:<br/>  Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;<br/>But who is their purveyor from above<br/>Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.<br/><br/>When Juan woke he found some good things ready,<br/>  A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes<br/>That ever made a youthful heart less steady,<br/>  Besides her maid's, as pretty for their size;<br/>But I have spoken of all this already--<br/>  A repetition's tiresome and unwise,--<br/>Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,<br/>Came always back to coffee and Haid√©e.<br/><br/>Both were so young, and one so innocent,<br/>  That bathing passed for nothing; Juan seemed<br/>To her, as 't were, the kind of being sent,<br/>  Of whom these two years she had nightly dreamed,<br/>A something to be loved, a creature meant<br/>  To be her happiness, and whom she deemed<br/>To render happy; all who joy would win<br/>Must share it,--Happiness was born a Twin.<br/><br/>It was such pleasure to behold him, such<br/>  Enlargement of existence to partake<br/>Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,<br/>  To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:<br/>To live with him for ever were too much;<br/>  But then the thought of parting made her quake;<br/>He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast<br/>Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.<br/><br/>And thus a moon rolled on, and fair Haid√©e<br/>  Paid daily visits to her boy, and took<br/>Such plentiful precautions, that still he<br/>  Remained unknown within his craggy nook;<br/>At last her father's prows put out to sea,<br/>  For certain merchantmen upon the look,<br/>Not as of yore to carry off an Io,<br/>But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.<br/><br/>Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,<br/>  So that, her father being at sea, she was<br/>Free as a married woman, or such other<br/>  Female, as where she likes may freely pass,<br/>Without even the encumbrance of a brother,<br/>  The freest she that ever gazed on glass:<br/>I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,<br/>Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.<br/><br/>Now she prolonged her visits and her talk<br/>  (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say<br/>So much as to propose to take a walk,--<br/>  For little had he wandered since the day<br/>On which, like a young flower snapped from the stalk,<br/>  Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--<br/>And thus they walked out in the afternoon,<br/>And saw the sun set opposite the moon.<br/><br/>It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,<br/>  With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,<br/>Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,<br/>  With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore<br/>A better welcome to the tempest-tost;<br/>  And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,<br/>Save on the dead long summer days, which make<br/>The outstretched Ocean glitter like a lake.<br/><br/>And the small ripple spilt upon the beach<br/>  Scarcely o'erpassed the cream of your champagne,<br/>When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,<br/>  That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!<br/>Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach<br/>  Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--<br/>Let us have Wine and Woman, Mirth and Laughter,<br/>Sermons and soda-water the day after.<br/><br/>Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;<br/>  The best of Life is but intoxication:<br/>Glory, the Grape, Love, Gold, in these are sunk<br/>  The hopes of all men, and of every nation;<br/>Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk<br/>  Of Life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion!<br/>But to return,--Get very drunk, and when<br/>You wake with headache--you shall see what then!<br/><br/>Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring<br/>  Some hock and soda-water, then you'll know<br/>A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;<br/>  For not the blest sherbet, sublimed with snow,<br/>Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,<br/>  Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,<br/>After long travel, Ennui, Love, or Slaughter,<br/>Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water!<br/><br/>The coast--I think it was the coast that I<br/>  Was just describing--Yes, it _was_ the coast--<br/>Lay at this period quiet as the sky,<br/>  The sands untumbled, the blue waves untossed,<br/>And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,<br/>  And dolphin's leap, and little billow crossed<br/>By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret<br/>Against the boundary it scarcely wet.<br/><br/>And forth they wandered, her sire being gone,<br/>  As I have said, upon an expedition;<br/>And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,<br/>  Save Zoe, who, although with due precision<br/>She waited on her lady with the Sun,<br/>  Thought daily service was her only mission,<br/>Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,<br/>And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.<br/><br/>It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded<br/>  Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,<br/>Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,<br/>  Circling all Nature, hushed, and dim, and still,<br/>With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded<br/>  On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill<br/>Upon the other, and the rosy sky<br/>With one star sparkling through it like an eye.<br/><br/>And thus they wandered forth, and hand in hand,<br/>  Over the shining pebbles and the shells,<br/>Glided along the smooth and hardened sand,<br/>  And in the worn and wild receptacles<br/>Worked by the storms, yet worked as it were planned<br/>  In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,<br/>They turned to rest; and, each clasped by an arm,<br/>Yielded to the deep Twilight's purple charm.<br/><br/>They looked up to the sky, whose floating glow<br/>  Spread like a rosy Ocean, vast and bright;<br/>They gazed upon the glittering sea below,<br/>  Whence the broad Moon rose circling into sight;<br/>They heard the waves' splash, and the wind so low,<br/>  And saw each other's dark eyes darting light<br/>Into each other--and, beholding this,<br/>Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;<br/><br/>A long, long kiss, a kiss of Youth, and Love,<br/>  And Beauty, all concentrating like rays<br/>Into one focus, kindled from above;<br/>  Such kisses as belong to early days,<br/>Where Heart, and Soul, and Sense, in concert move,<br/>  And the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,<br/>Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,<br/>I think, it must be reckoned by its length.<br/><br/>By length I mean duration; theirs endured<br/>  Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckoned;<br/>And if they had, they could not have secured<br/>  The sum of their sensations to a second:<br/>They had not spoken, but they felt allured,<br/>  As if their souls and lips each other beckoned,<br/>Which, being joined, like swarming bees they clung--<br/>Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.<br/><br/>They were alone, but not alone as they<br/>  Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;<br/>The silent Ocean, and the starlight bay,<br/>  The twilight glow, which momently grew less,<br/>The voiceless sands, and dropping caves, that lay<br/>  Around them, made them to each other press,<br/>As if there were no life beneath the sky<br/>Save theirs, and that their life could never die.<br/><br/>They feared no eyes nor ears on that lone beach;<br/>  They felt no terrors from the night; they were<br/>All in all to each other: though their speech<br/>  Was broken words, they _thought_ a language there,--<br/>And all the burning tongues the Passions teach<br/>  Found in one sigh the best interpreter<br/>Of Nature's oracle--first love,--that all<br/>Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.<br/><br/>Haid√©e spoke not of scruples, asked no vows,<br/>  Nor offered any; she had never heard<br/>Of plight and promises to be a spouse,<br/>  Or perils by a loving maid incurred;<br/>She was all which pure Ignorance allows,<br/>  And flew to her young mate like a young bird;<br/>And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she<br/>Had not one word to say of constancy.<br/><br/>She loved, and was belov√©d--she adored,<br/>  And she was worshipped after Nature's fashion--<br/>Their intense souls, into each other poured,<br/>  If souls could die, had perished in that passion,--<br/>But by degrees their senses were restored,<br/>  Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;<br/>And, beating 'gainst _his_ bosom, Haid√©e's heart<br/>Felt as if never more to beat apart.<br/><br/>Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,<br/>  So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour<br/>Was that in which the Heart is always full,<br/>  And, having o'er itself no further power,<br/>Prompts deeds Eternity can not annul,<br/>  But pays off moments in an endless shower<br/>Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving<br/>Pleasure or pain to one another living.<br/><br/>Alas! for Juan and Haid√©e! they were<br/>  So loving and so lovely--till then never,<br/>Excepting our first parents, such a pair<br/>  Had run the risk of being damned for ever:<br/>And Haid√©e, being devout as well as fair,<br/>  Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,<br/>And Hell and Purgatory--but forgot<br/>Just in the very crisis she should not.<br/><br/>They look upon each other, and their eyes<br/>  Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps<br/>Round Juan's head, and his around her lies<br/>  Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;<br/>She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,<br/>  He hers, until they end in broken gasps;<br/>And thus they form a group that's quite antique,<br/>Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.<br/><br/>And when those deep and burning moments passed,<br/>  And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,<br/>She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,<br/>  Sustained his head upon her bosom's charms;<br/>And now and then her eye to Heaven is cast,<br/>  And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,<br/>Pillowed on her o'erflowing heart, which pants<br/>With all it granted, and with all it grants.<br/><br/>An infant when it gazes on a light,<br/>  A child the moment when it drains the breast,<br/>A devotee when soars the Host in sight,<br/>  An Arab with a stranger for a guest,<br/>A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,<br/>  A miser filling his most hoarded chest,<br/>Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping<br/>As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.<br/><br/>For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,<br/>  All that it hath of Life with us is living;<br/>So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,<br/>  And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;<br/>All it hath felt, inflicted, passed, and proved,<br/>  Hushed into depths beyond the watcher's diving:<br/>There lies the thing we love with all its errors<br/>And all its charms, like Death without its terrors.<br/><br/>The Lady watched her lover--and that hour<br/>  Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude<br/>O'erflowed her soul with their united power;<br/>  Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude<br/>She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,<br/>  Where nought upon their passion could intrude,<br/>And all the stars that crowded the blue space<br/>Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.<br/><br/>Alas! the love of Women! it is known<br/>  To be a lovely and a fearful thing;<br/>For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,<br/>  And if 't is lost, Life hath no more to bring<br/>To them but mockeries of the past alone,<br/>  And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,<br/>Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real<br/>Torture is theirs--what they inflict they feel.<br/><br/>They are right; for Man, to man so oft unjust,<br/>  Is always so to Women: one sole bond<br/>Awaits them--treachery is all their trust;<br/>  Taught to conceal their bursting hearts despond<br/>Over their idol, till some wealthier lust<br/>  Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?<br/>A thankless husband--next, a faithless lover--<br/>Then dressing, nursing, praying--and all's over.<br/><br/>Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,<br/>  Some mind their household, others dissipation,<br/>Some run away, and but exchange their cares,<br/>  Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;<br/>Few changes e'er can better their affairs,<br/>  Theirs being an unnatural situation,<br/>From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:<br/>Some play the devil, and then write a novel.<br/><br/>Haid√©e was Nature's bride, and knew not this;<br/>  Haid√©e was Passion's child, born where the Sun<br/>Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss<br/>  Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one<br/>Made but to love, to feel that she was his<br/>  Who was her chosen: what was said or done<br/>Elsewhere was nothing. She had nought to fear,<br/>Hope, care, nor love, beyond,--her heart beat _here_.<br/><br/>And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!<br/>  How much it costs us! yet each rising throb<br/>Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,<br/>  That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob<br/>Joy of its alchemy, and to repeat<br/>  Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job<br/>To make us understand each good old maxim,<br/>So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.<br/><br/>And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted<br/>  Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed<br/>Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:<br/>  Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,<br/>By their own feelings hallowed and united,<br/>  Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:<br/>And they were happy--for to their young eyes<br/>Each was an angel, and earth Paradise.<br/><br/>Oh, Love! of whom great C√¶sar was the suitor,<br/>  Titus the master, Antony the slave,<br/>Horace, Catullus, scholars--Ovid tutor--<br/>  Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave<br/>All those may leap who rather would be neuter--<br/>  (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--<br/>Oh, Love! thou art the very God of evil,<br/>For, after all, we cannot call thee Devil.<br/><br/>Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,<br/>  And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:<br/>C√¶sar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,<br/>  Have much employed the Muse of History's pen:<br/>Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,<br/>  Such worthies Time will never see again;<br/>Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,<br/>They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.<br/><br/>Thou mak'st philosophers; there's Epicurus<br/>  And Aristippus, a material crew!<br/>Who to immoral courses would allure us<br/>  By theories quite practicable too;<br/>If only from the Devil they would insure us,<br/>  How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),<br/>"Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?"<br/>So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.<br/><br/>But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?<br/>  And should he have forgotten her so soon?<br/>I can't but say it seems to me most truly a<br/>  Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon<br/>Does these things for us, and whenever newly a<br/>  Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,<br/>Else how the devil is it that fresh features<br/>Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?<br/><br/>I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,<br/>  Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made<br/>Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast<br/>  No permanent foundation can be laid;<br/>Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,<br/>  And yet last night, being at a masquerade,<br/>I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,<br/>Which gave me some sensations like a villain.<br/><br/>But soon Philosophy came to my aid,<br/>  And whispered, "Think of every sacred tie!"<br/>"I will, my dear Philosophy!" I said,<br/>  "But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!<br/>I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,<br/>  Or neither--out of curiosity."<br/>"Stop!" cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian,<br/>(Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian;)<br/><br/>"Stop!" so I stopped.--But to return: that which<br/>  Men call inconstancy is nothing more<br/>Than admiration due where Nature's rich<br/>  Profusion with young beauty covers o'er<br/>Some favoured object; and as in the niche<br/>  A lovely statue we almost adore,<br/>This sort of adoration of the real<br/>Is but a heightening of the _beau ideal_.<br/><br/>'T is the perception of the Beautiful,<br/>  A fine extension of the faculties,<br/>Platonic, universal, wonderful,<br/>  Drawn from the stars, and filtered through the skies,<br/>Without which Life would be extremely dull;<br/>  In short, it is the use of our own eyes,<br/>With one or two small senses added, just<br/>To hint that flesh is formed of fiery dust.<br/><br/>Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,<br/>  For surely if we always could perceive<br/>In the same object graces quite as killing<br/>  As when she rose upon us like an Eve,<br/>'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling,<br/>  (For we must get them anyhow, or grieve),<br/>Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,<br/>How pleasant for the heart, as well as liver!<br/><br/>The Heart is like the sky, a part of Heaven,<br/>  But changes night and day, too, like the sky;<br/>Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,<br/>  And Darkness and Destruction as on high:<br/>But when it hath been scorched, and pierced, and riven,<br/>  Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye<br/>Pours forth at last the Heart's blood turned to tears,<br/>Which make the English climate of our years.<br/><br/>The liver is the lazaret of bile,<br/>  But very rarely executes its function,<br/>For the first passion stays there such a while,<br/>  That all the rest creep in and form a junction,<br/>Like knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil--<br/>  Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction--<br/>So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,<br/>Like Earthquakes from the hidden fire called "central."<br/><br/>In the mean time, without proceeding more<br/>  In this anatomy, I've finished now<br/>Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,<br/>  That being about the number I'll allow<br/>Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;<br/>  And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,<br/>Leaving Don Juan and Haid√©e to plead<br/>For them and theirs with all who deign to read.<br/><br/>CANTO THE THIRD.<br/><br/>HAIL, Muse! _et cetera._--We left Juan sleeping,<br/>  Pillowed upon a fair and happy breast,<br/>And watched by eyes that never yet knew weeping,<br/>  And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest<br/>To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,<br/>  Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,<br/>Had soiled the current of her sinless years,<br/>And turned her pure heart's purest blood to tears!<br/><br/>Oh, Love! what is it in this world of ours<br/>  Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah why<br/>With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,<br/>  And made thy best interpreter a sigh?<br/>As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,<br/>  And place them on their breast--but place to die--<br/>Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish<br/>Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.<br/><br/>In her first passion Woman loves her lover,<br/>  In all the others all she loves is Love,<br/>Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,<br/>  And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,<br/>As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:<br/>  One man alone at first her heart can move;<br/>She then prefers him in the plural number,<br/>Not finding that the additions much encumber.<br/><br/>I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;<br/>  But one thing's pretty sure; a woman planted<br/>(Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)--<br/>  After a decent time must be gallanted;<br/>Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs<br/>  Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;<br/>Yet there are some, they say, who have had _none_,<br/>But those who have ne'er end with only _one_.<br/><br/>'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign<br/>  Of human frailty, folly, also crime,<br/>That Love and Marriage rarely can combine,<br/>  Although they both are born in the same clime;<br/>Marriage from Love, like vinegar from wine--<br/>  A sad, sour, sober beverage--by Time<br/>Is sharpened from its high celestial flavour<br/>Down to a very homely household savour.<br/><br/>There's something of antipathy, as 't were,<br/>  Between their present and their future state;<br/>A kind of flattery that's hardly fair<br/>  Is used until the truth arrives too late--<br/>Yet what can people do, except despair?<br/>  The same things change their names at such a rate;<br/>For instance--Passion in a lover's glorious,<br/>But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.<br/><br/>Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;<br/>  They sometimes also get a little tired<br/>(But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:<br/>  The same things cannot always be admired,<br/>Yet 't is "so nominated in the bond,"<br/>  That both are tied till one shall have expired.<br/>Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning<br/>Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.<br/><br/>There's doubtless something in domestic doings<br/>  Which forms, in fact, true Love's antithesis;<br/>Romances paint at full length people's wooings,<br/>  But only give a bust of marriages;<br/>For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,<br/>  There's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:<br/>Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,<br/>He would have written sonnets all his life?<br/><br/>All tragedies are finished by a death,<br/>  All comedies are ended by a marriage;<br/>The future states of both are left to faith,<br/>  For authors fear description might disparage<br/>The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,<br/>  And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;<br/>So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,<br/>They say no more of Death or of the Lady.<br/><br/>The only two that in my recollection,<br/>  Have sung of Heaven and Hell, or marriage, are<br/>Dante and Milton, and of both the affection<br/>  Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar<br/>Of fault or temper ruined the connection<br/>  (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar);<br/>But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve<br/>Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.<br/><br/>Some persons say that Dante meant Theology<br/>  By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,<br/>Although my opinion may require apology,<br/>  Deem this a commentator's phantasy,<br/>Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he<br/>  Decided thus, and showed good reason why;<br/>I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics<br/>Meant to personify the Mathematics.<br/><br/>Haid√©e and Juan were not married, but<br/>  The fault was theirs, not mine: it is not fair,<br/>Chaste reader, then, in any way to put<br/>  The blame on me, unless you wish they were;<br/>Then if you'd have them wedded, please to shut<br/>  The book which treats of this erroneous pair,<br/>Before the consequences grow too awful;<br/>'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.<br/><br/>Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit<br/>  Indulgence of their innocent desires;<br/>But more imprudent grown with every visit,<br/>  Haid√©e forgot the island was her Sire's;<br/>When we have what we like 't is hard to miss it,<br/>  At least in the beginning, ere one tires;<br/>Thus she came often, not a moment losing,<br/>Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.<br/><br/>Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,<br/>  Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,<br/>For into a Prime Minister but change<br/>  His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;<br/>But he, more modest, took an humbler range<br/>  Of Life, and in an honester vocation<br/>Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,<br/>And merely practised as a sea-attorney.<br/><br/>The good old gentleman had been detained<br/>  By winds and waves, and some important captures;<br/>And, in the hope of more, at sea remained,<br/>  Although a squall or two had damped his raptures,<br/>By swamping one of the prizes; he had chained<br/>  His prisoners, dividing them like chapters<br/>In numbered lots; they all had cuffs and collars,<br/>And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.<br/><br/>Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,<br/>  Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold<br/>To his Tunis correspondents, save one man<br/>  Tossed overboard unsaleable (being old);<br/>The rest--save here and there some richer one,<br/>  Reserved for future ransom--in the hold,<br/>Were linked alike, as, for the common people, he<br/>Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.<br/><br/>The merchandise was served in the same way,<br/>  Pieced out for different marts in the Levant,<br/>Except some certain portions of the prey,<br/>  Light classic articles of female want,<br/>French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,<br/>  Guitars and castanets from Alicant,<br/>All which selected from the spoil he gathers,<br/>Robbed for his daughter by the best of fathers.<br/><br/>A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,<br/>  Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,<br/>He chose from several animals he saw--<br/>  A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,<br/>Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,<br/>  The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance:<br/>These to secure in this strong blowing weather,<br/>He caged in one huge hamper altogether.<br/><br/>Then, having settled his marine affairs,<br/>  Despatching single cruisers here and there,<br/>His vessel having need of some repairs,<br/>  He shaped his course to where his daughter fair<br/>Continued still her hospitable cares;<br/>  But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,<br/>And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,<br/>His port lay on the other side o' the isle.<br/><br/>And there he went ashore without delay,<br/>  Having no custom-house nor quarantine<br/>To ask him awkward questions on the way,<br/>  About the time and place where he had been:<br/>He left his ship to be hove down next day,<br/>  With orders to the people to careen;<br/>So that all hands were busy beyond measure,<br/>In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.<br/><br/>Arriving at the summit of a hill<br/>  Which overlooked the white walls of his home,<br/>He stopped.--What singular emotions fill<br/>  Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!<br/>With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--<br/>  With love for many, and with fears for some;<br/>All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,<br/>And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.<br/><br/>The approach of home to husbands and to sires,<br/>  After long travelling by land or water,<br/>Most naturally some small doubt inspires--<br/>  A female family's a serious matter,<br/>(None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--<br/>  But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);<br/>Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,<br/>And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.<br/><br/>An honest gentleman at his return<br/>  May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;<br/>Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,<br/>  Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;<br/>The odds are that he finds a handsome urn<br/>  To his memory--and two or three young misses<br/>Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches--<br/>And that _his_ Argus--bites him by the breeches.<br/><br/>If single, probably his plighted Fair<br/>  Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;<br/>But all the better, for the happy pair<br/>  May quarrel, and, the lady growing wiser,<br/>He may resume his amatory care<br/>  As cavalier servente, or despise her;<br/>And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,<br/>Writes odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.<br/><br/>And oh! ye gentlemen who have already<br/>  Some chaste _liaison_ of the kind--I mean<br/>An honest friendship with a married lady--<br/>  The only thing of this sort ever seen<br/>To last--of all connections the most steady,<br/>  And the true Hymen, (the first's but a screen)--<br/>Yet, for all that, keep not too long away--<br/>I've known the absent wronged four times a day.<br/><br/>Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had<br/>  Much less experience of dry land than Ocean,<br/>On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;<br/>  But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion<br/>Of the true reason of his not being sad,<br/>  Or that of any other strong emotion;<br/>He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,<br/>But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.<br/><br/>He saw his white walls shining in the sun,<br/>  His garden trees all shadowy and green;<br/>He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,<br/>  The distant dog-bark; and perceived between<br/>The umbrage of the wood, so cool and dun,<br/>  The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen<br/>Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes<br/>Of coloured garbs, as bright as butterflies.<br/><br/>And as the spot where they appear he nears,<br/>  Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,<br/>He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,<br/>  But an unhallowed, earthly sound of fiddling!<br/>A melody which made him doubt his ears,<br/>  The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;<br/>A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after--<br/>A most unoriental roar of laughter.<br/><br/>And still more nearly to the place advancing,<br/>  Descending rather quickly the declivity,<br/>Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,<br/>  'Midst other indications of festivity,<br/>Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing<br/>  Like Dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he<br/>Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,<br/>To which the Levantines are very partial.<br/><br/>And further on a troop of Grecian girls,<br/>  The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,<br/>Were strung together like a row of pearls,<br/>  Linked hand in hand, and dancing; each too having<br/>Down her white neck long floating auburn curls--<br/>  (The least of which would set ten poets raving);<br/>Their leader sang--and bounded to her song<br/>With choral step and voice the virgin throng.<br/><br/>And here, assembled cross-legged round their trays,<br/>  Small social parties just begun to dine;<br/>Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,<br/>  And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,<br/>And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;<br/>  Above them their dessert grew on its vine;--<br/>The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er,<br/>Dropped in their laps, scarce plucked, their mellow store.<br/><br/>A band of children, round a snow-white ram,<br/>  There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;<br/>While peaceful as if still an unweaned lamb,<br/>  The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers<br/>His sober head, majestically tame,<br/>  Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers<br/>His brow, as if in act to butt, and then<br/>Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.<br/><br/>Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,<br/>  Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,<br/>Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,<br/>  The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,<br/>The innocence which happy childhood blesses,<br/>  Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;<br/>So that the philosophical beholder<br/>Sighed for their sakes--that they should e'er grow older.<br/><br/>Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales<br/>  To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,<br/>Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,<br/>  Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,<br/>Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,<br/>  Of rocks bewitched that open to the knockers,<br/>Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,<br/>Transformed their lords to beasts (but that's a fact).<br/><br/>Here was no lack of innocent diversion<br/>  For the imagination or the senses,<br/>Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,<br/>  All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;<br/>But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,<br/>  Perceiving in his absence such expenses,<br/>Dreading that climax of all human ills,<br/>The inflammation of his weekly bills.<br/><br/>Ah! what is man? what perils still environ<br/>  The happiest mortals even after dinner!<br/>A day of gold from out an age of iron<br/>  Is all that Life allows the luckiest sinner;<br/>Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a Siren,<br/>  That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;<br/>Lambro's reception at his people's banquet<br/>Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.<br/><br/>He--being a man who seldom used a word<br/>  Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise<br/>(In general he surprised men with the sword)<br/>  His daughter--had not sent before to advise<br/>Of his arrival, so that no one stirred;<br/>  And long he paused to re-assure his eyes,<br/>In fact much more astonished than delighted,<br/>To find so much good company invited.<br/><br/>He did not know (alas! how men will lie)<br/>  That a report (especially the Greeks)<br/>Avouched his death (such people never die),<br/>  And put his house in mourning several weeks,--<br/>But now their eyes and also lips were dry;<br/>  The bloom, too, had returned to Haid√©e's cheeks:<br/>Her tears, too, being returned into their fount,<br/>She now kept house upon her own account.<br/><br/>Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,<br/>  Which turned the isle into a place of pleasure;<br/>The servants all were getting drunk or idling,<br/>  A life which made them happy beyond measure.<br/>Her father's hospitality seemed middling,<br/>  Compared with what Haid√©e did with his treasure;<br/>'T was wonderful how things went on improving,<br/>While she had not one hour to spare from loving.<br/><br/>Perhaps you think, in stumbling on this feast,<br/>  He flew into a passion, and in fact<br/>There was no mighty reason to be pleased;<br/>  Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,<br/>The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,<br/>  To teach his people to be more exact,<br/>And that, proceeding at a very high rate,<br/>He showed the royal _penchants_ of a pirate.<br/><br/>You're wrong.--He was the mildest mannered man<br/>  That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat;<br/>With such true breeding of a gentleman,<br/>  You never could divine his real thought;<br/>No courtier could, and scarcely woman can<br/>  Gird more deceit within a petticoat;<br/>Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,<br/>He was so great a loss to good society.<br/><br/>Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,<br/>  Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,<br/>With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,<br/>  Boded no good, whatever it expressed,<br/>He asked the meaning of this holiday;<br/>  The vinous Greek to whom he had addressed<br/>His question, much too merry to divine<br/>The questioner, filled up a glass of wine,<br/><br/>And without turning his facetious head,<br/>  Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,<br/>Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,<br/>  "Talking's dry work, I have no time to spare."<br/>A second hiccuped, "Our old Master's dead,<br/>  You'd better ask our Mistress who's his heir."<br/>"Our Mistress!" quoth a third: "Our Mistress!--pooh!--<br/>You mean our Master--not the old, but new."<br/><br/>These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom<br/>  They thus addressed--and Lambro's visage fell--<br/>And o'er his eye a momentary gloom<br/>  Passed, but he strove quite courteously to quell<br/>The expression, and endeavouring to resume<br/>  His smile, requested one of them to tell<br/>The name and quality of his new patron,<br/>Who seemed to have turned Haid√©e into a matron.<br/><br/>"I know not," quoth the fellow, "who or what<br/>  He is, nor whence he came--and little care;<br/>But this I know, that this roast capon's fat,<br/>  And that good wine ne'er washed down better fare;<br/>And if you are not satisfied with that,<br/>  Direct your questions to my neighbour there;<br/>He'll answer all for better or for worse,<br/>For none likes more to hear himself converse."<br/><br/>I said that Lambro was a man of patience,<br/>  And certainly he showed the best of breeding,<br/>Which scarce even France, the Paragon of nations,<br/>  E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;<br/>He bore these sneers against his near relations,<br/>  His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,<br/>The insults, too, of every servile glutton,<br/>Who all the time was eating up his mutton.<br/><br/>Now in a person used to much command--<br/>  To bid men come, and go, and come again--<br/>To see his orders done, too, out of hand--<br/>  Whether the word was death, or but the chain--<br/>It may seem strange to find his manners bland;<br/>  Yet such things are, which I cannot explain,<br/>Though, doubtless, he who can command himself<br/>Is good to govern--almost as a Guelf.<br/><br/>Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,<br/>  But never in his real and serious mood;<br/>Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,<br/>  He lay coiled like the Boa in the wood;<br/>With him it never was a word and blow,<br/>  His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,<br/>But in his silence there was much to rue,<br/>And his _one_ blow left little work for _two_.<br/><br/>He asked no further questions, and proceeded<br/>  On to the house, but by a private way,<br/>So that the few who met him hardly heeded,<br/>  So little they expected him that day;<br/>If love paternal in his bosom pleaded<br/>  For Haid√©e's sake, is more than I can say,<br/>But certainly to one deemed dead returning,<br/>This revel seemed a curious mode of mourning.<br/><br/>If all the dead could now return to life,<br/>  (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,<br/>For instance, if a husband or his wife<br/>  (Nuptial examples are as good as any),<br/>No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,<br/>  The present weather would be much more rainy--<br/>Tears shed into the grave of the connection<br/>Would share most probably its resurrection.<br/><br/>He entered in the house no more his home,<br/>  A thing to human feelings the most trying,<br/>And harder for the heart to overcome,<br/>  Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;<br/>To find our hearthstone turned into a tomb,<br/>  And round its once warm precincts palely lying<br/>The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,<br/>Beyond a _single gentleman's_ belief.<br/><br/>He entered in the house--his home no more,<br/>  For without hearts there is no home;--and felt<br/>The solitude of passing his own door<br/>  Without a welcome: _there_ he long had dwelt,<br/>There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,<br/>  There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt<br/>Over the innocence of that sweet child,<br/>His only shrine of feelings undefiled.<br/><br/>He was a man of a strange temperament,<br/>  Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,<br/>Moderate in all his habits, and content<br/>  With temperance in pleasure, as in food,<br/>Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant<br/>  For something better, if not wholly good;<br/>His Country's wrongs and his despair to save her<br/>Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.<br/><br/>The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,<br/>  The hardness by long habitude produced,<br/>The dangerous life in which he had grown old,<br/>  The mercy he had granted oft abused,<br/>The sights he was accustomed to behold,<br/>  The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,<br/>Had cost his enemies a long repentance,<br/>And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.<br/><br/>But something of the spirit of old Greece<br/>  Flashed o'er his soul a few heroic rays,<br/>Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece<br/>  His predecessors in the Colchian days;<br/>'T is true he had no ardent love for peace--<br/>  Alas! his country showed no path to praise:<br/>Hate to the world and war with every nation<br/>He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.<br/><br/>Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime<br/>  Shed its Ionian elegance, which showed<br/>Its power unconsciously full many a time,--<br/>  A taste seen in the choice of his abode,<br/>A love of music and of scenes sublime,<br/>  A pleasure in the gentle stream that flowed<br/>Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,<br/>Bedewed his spirit in his calmer hours.<br/><br/>But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed<br/>  On that belov√©d daughter; she had been<br/>The only thing which kept his heart unclosed<br/>  Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen,<br/>A lonely pure affection unopposed:<br/>  There wanted but the loss of this to wean<br/>His feelings from all milk of human kindness,<br/>And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.<br/><br/>The cubless tigress in her jungle raging<br/>  Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;<br/>The Ocean when its yeasty war is waging<br/>  Is awful to the vessel near the rock;<br/>But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,<br/>  Their fury being spent by its own shock,<br/>Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire<br/>Of a strong human heart, and in a Sire.<br/><br/>It is a hard although a common case<br/>  To find our children running restive--they<br/>In whom our brightest days we would retrace,<br/>  Our little selves re-formed in finer clay,<br/>Just as old age is creeping on apace,<br/>  And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,<br/>They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,<br/>But in good company--the gout or stone.<br/><br/>Yet a fine family is a fine thing<br/>  (Provided they don't come in after dinner);<br/>'T is beautiful to see a matron bring<br/>  Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);<br/>Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling<br/>  To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).<br/>A lady with her daughters or her nieces<br/>Shine like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.<br/><br/>Old Lambro passed unseen a private gate,<br/>  And stood within his hall at eventide;<br/>Meantime the lady and her lover sate<br/>  At wassail in their beauty and their pride:<br/>An ivory inlaid table spread with state<br/>  Before them, and fair slaves on every side;<br/>Gems, gold, and silver, formed the service mostly,<br/>Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.<br/><br/>The dinner made about a hundred dishes;<br/>  Lamb and pistachio nuts--in short, all meats,<br/>And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes<br/>  Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,<br/>Dressed to a Sybarite's most pampered wishes;<br/>  The beverage was various sherbets<br/>Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,<br/>Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.<br/><br/>These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,<br/>  And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,<br/>And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,<br/>  In small fine China cups, came in at last;<br/>Gold cups of filigree, made to secure<br/>  The hand from burning, underneath them placed;<br/>Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boiled<br/>Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoiled.<br/><br/>The hangings of the room were tapestry, made<br/>  Of velvet panels, each of different hue,<br/>And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;<br/>  And round them ran a yellow border too;<br/>The upper border, richly wrought, displayed,<br/>  Embroidered delicately o'er with blue,<br/>Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,<br/>From poets, or the moralists their betters.<br/><br/>These Oriental writings on the wall,<br/>  Quite common in those countries, are a kind<br/>Of monitors adapted to recall,<br/>  Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind,<br/>The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,<br/>  And took his kingdom from him: You will find,<br/>Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,<br/>There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.<br/><br/>A Beauty at the season's close grown hectic,<br/>  A Genius who has drunk himself to death,<br/>A Rake turned methodistic, or Eclectic--<br/>  (For that's the name they like to pray beneath)--<br/>But most, an Alderman struck apoplectic,<br/>  Are things that really take away the breath,--<br/>And show that late hours, wine, and love are able<br/>To do not much less damage than the table.<br/><br/>Haid√©e and Juan carpeted their feet<br/>  On crimson satin, bordered with pale blue;<br/>Their sofa occupied three parts complete<br/>  Of the apartment--and appeared quite new;<br/>The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)<br/>  Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew<br/>A sun embossed in gold, whose rays of tissue,<br/>Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.<br/><br/>Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,<br/>  Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats<br/>And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,<br/>  Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,<br/>And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain<br/>  Their bread as ministers and favourites (that's<br/>To say, by degradation) mingled there<br/>As plentiful as in a court, or fair.<br/><br/>There was no want of lofty mirrors, and<br/>  The tables, most of ebony inlaid<br/>With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,<br/>  Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,<br/>Fretted with gold or silver:--by command<br/>  The greater part of these were ready spread<br/>With viands and sherbets in ice--and wine--<br/>Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.<br/><br/>Of all the dresses I select Haid√©e's:<br/>  She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;<br/>Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise--<br/>  'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow:<br/>With buttons formed of pearls as large as peas,<br/>  All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,<br/>And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,<br/>Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flowed round her.<br/><br/>One large gold bracelet clasped each lovely arm,<br/>  Lockless--so pliable from the pure gold<br/>That the hand stretched and shut it without harm,<br/>  The limb which it adorned its only mould;<br/>So beautiful--its very shape would charm,<br/>  And clinging, as if loath to lose its hold,<br/>The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin<br/>That e'er by precious metal was held in.<br/><br/>Around, as Princess of her father's land,<br/>  A like gold bar above her instep rolled<br/>Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;<br/>  Her hair was starred with gems; her veil's fine fold<br/>Below her breast was fastened with a band<br/>  Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;<br/>Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furled<br/>About the prettiest ankle in the world.<br/><br/>Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel<br/>  Flowed like an Alpine torrent which the sun<br/>Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal<br/>  Her person if allowed at large to run,<br/>And still they seemed resentfully to feel<br/>  The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun<br/>Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began<br/>To offer his young pinion as her fan.<br/><br/>Round her she made an atmosphere of life,<br/>  The very air seemed lighter from her eyes,<br/>They were so soft and beautiful, and rife<br/>  With all we can imagine of the skies,<br/>And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--<br/>  Too pure even for the purest human ties;<br/>Her overpowering presence made you feel<br/>It would not be idolatry to kneel.<br/><br/>Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged<br/>  (It is the country's custom, but in vain),<br/>For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,<br/>  The glossy rebels mocked the jetty stain,<br/>And in their native beauty stood avenged:<br/>  Her nails were touched with henna; but, again,<br/>The power of Art was turned to nothing, for<br/>They could not look more rosy than before.<br/><br/>The henna should be deeply dyed to make<br/>  The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;<br/>She had no need of this, day ne'er will break<br/>  On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:<br/>The eye might doubt if it were well awake,<br/>  She was so like a vision; I might err,<br/>But Shakespeare also says, 't is very silly<br/>"To gild refin√©d gold, or paint the lily."<br/><br/>Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,<br/>  But a white baracan, and so transparent<br/>The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,<br/>  Like small stars through the milky way apparent;<br/>His turban, furled in many a graceful fold,<br/>  An emerald aigrette, with Haid√©e's hair in 't,<br/>Surmounted as its clasp--a glowing crescent,<br/>Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.<br/><br/>And now they were diverted by their suite,<br/>  Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,<br/>Which made their new establishment complete;<br/>  The last was of great fame, and liked to show it;<br/>His verses rarely wanted their due feet--<br/>  And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,<br/>He being paid to satirise or flatter,<br/>As the Psalm says, "inditing a good matter."<br/><br/>He praised the present, and abused the past,<br/>  Reversing the good custom of old days,<br/>An Eastern anti-jacobin at last<br/>  He turned, preferring pudding to _no_ praise--<br/>For some few years his lot had been o'ercast<br/>  By his seeming independent in his lays,<br/>But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha--<br/>With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.<br/><br/>He was a man who had seen many changes,<br/>  And always changed as true as any needle;<br/>His Polar Star being one which rather ranges,<br/>  And not the fixed--he knew the way to wheedle:<br/>So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;<br/>  And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),<br/>He lied with such a fervour of intention--<br/>There was no doubt he earned his laureate pension.<br/><br/>But _he_ had genius,--when a turncoat has it,<br/>  The _Vates irritabilis_ takes care<br/>That without notice few full moons shall pass it;<br/>  Even good men like to make the public stare:--<br/>But to my subject--let me see--what was it?--<br/>  Oh!--the third canto--and the pretty pair--<br/>Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode<br/>Of living in their insular abode.<br/><br/>Their poet, a sad trimmer, but, no less,<br/>  In company a very pleasant fellow,<br/>Had been the favourite of full many a mess<br/>  Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;<br/>And though his meaning they could rarely guess,<br/>  Yet still they deigned to hiccup or to bellow<br/>The glorious meed of popular applause,<br/>Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.<br/><br/>But now being lifted into high society,<br/>  And having picked up several odds and ends<br/>Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,<br/>  He deemed, being in a lone isle, among friends,<br/>That, without any danger of a riot, he<br/>  Might for long lying make himself amends;<br/>And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,<br/>Agree to a short armistice with Truth.<br/><br/>He had travelled 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,<br/>  And knew the self-loves of the different nations;<br/>And having lived with people of all ranks,<br/>  Had something ready upon most occasions--<br/>Which got him a few presents and some thanks.<br/>  He varied with some skill his adulations;<br/>To "do at Rome as Romans do," a piece<br/>Of conduct was which _he_ observed in Greece.<br/><br/>Thus, usually, when _he_ was asked to sing,<br/>  He gave the different nations something national;<br/>'T was all the same to him--"God save the King,"<br/>  Or "√áa ira," according to the fashion all:<br/>His Muse made increment of anything,<br/>  From the high lyric down to the low rational;<br/>If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder<br/>Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?<br/><br/>In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;<br/>  In England a six canto quarto tale;<br/>In Spain he'd make a ballad or romance on<br/>  The last

lightning might assail<br/>  And shiver them to ashes, but to trail<br/>A long and snake-like life of dull decay<br/>Was not for them--they had too little clay.<br/><br/>They were alone once more; for them to be<br/>  Thus was another Eden; they were never<br/>Weary, unless when separate: the tree<br/>  Cut from its forest root of years--the river<br/>Dammed from its fountain--the child from the knee<br/>  And breast maternal weaned at once for ever,--<br/>Would wither less than these two torn apart;<br/>Alas! there is no instinct like the Heart--<br/><br/>The Heart--which may be broken: happy they!<br/>  Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,<br/>The precious porcelain of human clay,<br/>  Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold<br/>The long year linked with heavy day on day,<br/>  And all which must be borne, and never told;<br/>While Life's strange principle will often lie<br/>Deepest in those who long the most to die.<br/><br/>"Whom the gods love die young," was said of yore,<br/>  And many deaths do they escape by this:<br/>The death of friends, and that which slays even more--<br/>  The death of Friendship, Love, Youth, all that is,<br/>Except mere breath; and since the silent shore<br/>  Awaits at last even those who longest miss<br/>The old Archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave<br/>Which men weep over may be meant to save.<br/><br/>Haid√©e and Juan thought not of the dead--<br/>  The Heavens, and Earth, and Air, seemed made for them:<br/>They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;<br/>  They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:<br/>Each was the other's mirror, and but read<br/>  Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem.<br/>And knew such brightness was but the reflection<br/>Of their exchanging glances of affection.<br/><br/>The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,<br/>  The least glance better understood than words,<br/>Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;<br/>  A language, too, but like to that of birds,<br/>Known but to them, at least appearing such<br/>  As but to lovers a true sense affords;<br/>Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd<br/>To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard--<br/><br/>All these were theirs, for they were children still,<br/>  And children still they should have ever been;<br/>They were not made in the real world to fill<br/>  A busy character in the dull scene,<br/>But like two beings born from out a rill,<br/>  A Nymph and her belov√©d, all unseen<br/>To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,<br/>And never know the weight of human hours.<br/><br/>Moons changing had rolled on, and changeless found<br/>  Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys<br/>As rarely they beheld throughout their round;<br/>  And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,<br/>For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound<br/>  By the mere senses; and that which destroys<br/>Most love--possession--unto them appeared<br/>A thing which each endearment more endeared.<br/><br/>Oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful!<br/>  But theirs was Love in which the Mind delights<br/>To lose itself, when the old world grows dull,<br/>  And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,<br/>Intrigues, adventures of the common school,<br/>  Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,<br/>Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,<br/>Whose husband only knows her not a whore.<br/><br/>Hard words--harsh truth! a truth which many know.<br/>  Enough.--The faithful and the fairy pair,<br/>Who never found a single hour too slow,<br/>  What was it made them thus exempt from care?<br/>Young innate feelings all have felt below,<br/>  Which perish in the rest, but in them were<br/>Inherent--what we mortals call romantic,<br/>And always envy, though we deem it frantic.<br/><br/>This is in others a factitious state,<br/>  An opium dream of too much youth and reading,<br/>But was in them their nature or their fate:<br/>  No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,<br/>For Haid√©e's knowledge was by no means great,<br/>  And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;<br/>So that there was no reason for their loves<br/>More than for those of nightingales or doves.<br/><br/>They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour<br/>  Dear unto all, but dearest to _their_ eyes,<br/>For it had made them what they were: the power<br/>  Of Love had first o'erwhelmed them from such skies,<br/>When Happiness had been their only dower,<br/>  And Twilight saw them linked in Passion's ties;<br/>Charmed with each other, all things charmed that brought<br/>The past still welcome as the present thought.<br/><br/>I know not why, but in that hour to-night,<br/>  Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,<br/>And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,<br/>  Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,<br/>When one is shook in sound, and one in sight:<br/>  And thus some boding flashed through either frame,<br/>And called from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,<br/>While one new tear arose in Haid√©e's eye.<br/><br/>That large black prophet eye seemed to dilate<br/>  And follow far the disappearing sun,<br/>As if their last day of a happy date<br/>  With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;<br/>Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate--<br/>  He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,<br/>His glance inquired of hers for some excuse<br/>For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.<br/><br/>She turned to him, and smiled, but in that sort<br/>  Which makes not others smile; then turned aside:<br/>Whatever feeling shook her, it seemed short,<br/>  And mastered by her wisdom or her pride;<br/>When Juan spoke, too--it might be in sport--<br/>  Of this their mutual feeling, she replied--<br/>"If it should be so,--but--it cannot be--<br/>Or I at least shall not survive to see."<br/><br/>Juan would question further, but she pressed<br/>  His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,<br/>And then dismissed the omen from her breast,<br/>  Defying augury with that fond kiss;<br/>And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:<br/>  Some people prefer wine--'t is not amiss;<br/>I have tried both--so those who would a part take<br/>May choose between the headache and the heartache.<br/><br/>One of the two, according to your choice,<br/>  Woman or wine, you'll have to undergo;<br/>Both maladies are taxes on our joys:<br/>  But which to choose, I really hardly know;<br/>And if I had to give a casting voice,<br/>  For both sides I could many reasons show,<br/>And then decide, without great wrong to either,<br/>It were much better to have both than neither.<br/><br/>Juan and Haid√©e gazed upon each other<br/>  With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,<br/>Which mixed all feelings--friend, child, lover, brother--<br/>  All that the best can mingle and express<br/>When two pure hearts are poured in one another,<br/>  And love too much, and yet can not love less;<br/>But almost sanctify the sweet excess<br/>By the immortal wish and power to bless.<br/><br/>Mixed in each other's arms, and heart in heart,<br/>  Why did they not then die?--they had lived too long<br/>Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;<br/>  Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;<br/>The World was not for them--nor the World's art<br/>  For beings passionate as Sappho's song;<br/>Love was born _with_ them, _in_ them, so intense,<br/>It was their very Spirit--not a sense.<br/><br/>They should have lived together deep in woods,<br/>  Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were<br/>Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes<br/>  Called social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:<br/>How lonely every freeborn creature broods!<br/>  The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;<br/>The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow<br/>Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.<br/><br/>Now pillowed cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,<br/>  Haid√©e and Juan their siesta took,<br/>A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,<br/>  For ever and anon a something shook<br/>Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;<br/>  And Haid√©e's sweet lips murmured like a brook<br/>A wordless music, and her face so fair<br/>Stirred with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.<br/><br/>Or as the stirring of a deep clear stream<br/>  Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind<br/>Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,<br/>  The mystical Usurper of the mind--<br/>O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem<br/>  Good to the soul which we no more can bind;<br/>Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)<br/>Senseless to feel, and with sealed eyes to see.<br/><br/>She dreamed of being alone on the sea-shore,<br/>  Chained to a rock; she knew not how, but stir<br/>She could not from the spot, and the loud roar<br/>  Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;<br/>And o'er her upper lip they seemed to pour,<br/>  Until she sobbed for breath, and soon they were<br/>Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high--<br/>Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.<br/><br/>Anon--she was released, and then she strayed<br/>  O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,<br/>And stumbled almost every step she made:<br/>  And something rolled before her in a sheet,<br/>Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:<br/>  'T was white and indistinct, nor stopped to meet<br/>Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed and grasped,<br/>And ran, but it escaped her as she clasped.<br/><br/>The dream changed:--in a cave she stood, its walls<br/>  Were hung with marble icicles; the work<br/>Of ages on its water-fretted halls,<br/>  Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;<br/>Her hair was dripping, and the very balls<br/>  Of her black eyes seemed turned to tears, and mirk<br/>The sharp rocks looked below each drop they caught,<br/>Which froze to marble as it fell,--she thought.<br/><br/>And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,<br/>  Pale as the foam that frothed on his dead brow,<br/>Which she essayed in vain to clear, (how sweet<br/>  Were once her cares, how idle seemed they now!)<br/>Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat<br/>  Of his quenched heart: and the sea dirges low<br/>Rang in her sad ears like a Mermaid's song,<br/>And that brief dream appeared a life too long.<br/><br/>And gazing on the dead, she thought his face<br/>  Faded, or altered into something new--<br/>Like to her Father's features, till each trace<br/>  More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew--<br/>With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;<br/>  And starting, she awoke, and what to view?<br/>Oh! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?<br/>'T is--'t is her Father's--fixed upon the pair!<br/><br/>Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,<br/>  With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see<br/>Him whom she deemed a habitant where dwell<br/>  The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be<br/>Perchance the death of one she loved too well:<br/>  Dear as her father had been to Haid√©e,<br/>It was a moment of that awful kind--<br/>I have seen such--but must not call to mind.<br/><br/>Up Juan sprang to Haid√©e's bitter shriek,<br/>  And caught her falling, and from off the wall<br/>Snatched down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak<br/>  Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:<br/>Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,<br/>  Smiled scornfully, and said, "Within my call,<br/>A thousand scimitars await the word;<br/>Put up, young man, put up your silly sword."<br/><br/>And Haid√©e clung around him; "Juan, 't is--<br/>  'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--<br/>He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.<br/>  Oh! dearest father, in this agony<br/>Of pleasure and of pain--even while I kiss<br/>  Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be<br/>That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?<br/>Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy."<br/><br/>High and inscrutable the old man stood,<br/>  Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye--<br/>Not always signs with him of calmest mood:<br/>  He looked upon her, but gave no reply;<br/>Then turned to Juan, in whose cheek the blood<br/>  Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;<br/>In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring<br/>On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.<br/><br/>"Young man, your sword;" so Lambro once more said:<br/>  Juan replied, "Not while this arm is free."<br/>The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,<br/>  And drawing from his belt a pistol he<br/>Replied, "Your blood be then on your own head."<br/>  Then looked close at the flint, as if to see<br/>'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--<br/>And next proceeded quietly to cock.<br/><br/>It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,<br/>  That cocking of a pistol, when you know<br/>A moment more will bring the sight to bear<br/>  Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;<br/>A gentlemanly distance, not too near,<br/>  If you have got a former friend for foe;<br/>But after being fired at once or twice,<br/>The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.<br/><br/>Lambro presented, and one instant more<br/>  Had stopped this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,<br/>When Haid√©e threw herself her boy before;<br/>  Stern as her sire: "On me," she cried, "let Death<br/>Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore<br/>  He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;<br/>I love him--I will die with him: I knew<br/>Your nature's firmness--know your daughter's too."<br/><br/>A minute past, and she had been all tears,<br/>  And tenderness, and infancy; but now<br/>She stood as one who championed human fears--<br/>  Pale, statue-like, and stern, she wooed the blow;<br/>And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,<br/>  She drew up to her height, as if to show<br/>A fairer mark; and with a fixed eye scanned<br/>Her Father's face--but never stopped his hand.<br/><br/>He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange<br/>  How like they looked! the expression was the same;<br/>Serenely savage, with a little change<br/>  In the large dark eye's mutual--darted flame;<br/>For she, too, was as one who could avenge,<br/>  If cause should be--a Lioness, though tame.<br/>Her Father's blood before her Father's face<br/>Boiled up, and proved her truly of his race.<br/><br/>I said they were alike, their features and<br/>  Their stature, differing but in sex and years;<br/>Even to the delicacy of their hand<br/>  There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;<br/>And now to see them, thus divided, stand<br/>  In fixed ferocity, when joyous tears<br/>And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,<br/>Shows what the passions are in their full growth.<br/><br/>The father paused a moment, then withdrew<br/>  His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,<br/>And looking on her, as to look her through,<br/>  "Not _I_," he said, "have sought this stranger's ill;<br/>Not _I_ have made this desolation: few<br/>  Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;<br/>But I must do my duty--how thou hast<br/>Done thine, the present vouches for the past.<br/><br/>"Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,<br/>  His own shall roll before you like a ball!"<br/>He raised his whistle, as the word he said,<br/>  And blew; another answered to the call,<br/>And rushing in disorderly, though led,<br/>  And armed from boot to turban, one and all,<br/>Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;<br/>He gave the word,--"Arrest or slay the Frank."<br/><br/>Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew<br/>  His daughter; while compressed within his clasp,<br/>Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;<br/>  In vain she struggled in her father's grasp--<br/>His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew<br/>  Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,<br/>The file of pirates--save the foremost, who<br/>Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.<br/><br/>The second had his cheek laid open; but<br/>  The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took<br/>The blows upon his cutlass, and then put<br/>  His own well in; so well, ere you could look,<br/>His man was floored, and helpless at his foot,<br/>  With the blood running like a little brook<br/>From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red--<br/>One on the arm, the other on the head.<br/><br/>And then they bound him where he fell, and bore<br/>  Juan from the apartment: with a sign<br/>Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,<br/>  Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.<br/>They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar<br/>  Until they reached some galliots, placed in line;<br/>On board of one of these, and under hatches,<br/>They stowed him, with strict orders to the watches.<br/><br/>The world is full of strange vicissitudes,<br/>  And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:<br/>A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,<br/>  Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,<br/>Just at the very time when he least broods<br/>  On such a thing, is suddenly to sea sent,<br/>Wounded and chained, so that he cannot move,<br/>And all because a lady fell in love.<br/><br/>Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,<br/>  Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!<br/>Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;<br/>  For if my pure libations exceed three,<br/>I feel my heart become so sympathetic,<br/>  That I must have recourse to black Bohea:<br/>'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,<br/>For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,<br/><br/>Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!<br/>  Sweet Na√Øad of the Phlegethontic rill!<br/>Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,--<br/>  And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?<br/>I would take refuge in weak punch, but _rack_<br/>  (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill<br/>My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,<br/>Wakes me next morning with its synonym.<br/><br/>I leave Don Juan for the present, safe--<br/>  Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;<br/>Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half<br/>  Of those with which his Haid√©e's bosom bounded?<br/>She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,<br/>  And then give way, subdued because surrounded;<br/>Her mother was a Moorish maid from Fez,<br/>Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.<br/><br/>There the large olive rains its amber store<br/>  In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,<br/>Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;<br/>  But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,<br/>And Midnight listens to the lion's roar,<br/>  And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,<br/>Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;<br/>And as the soil is, so the heart of man.<br/><br/>Afric is all the Sun's, and as her earth<br/>  Her human clay is kindled; full of power<br/>For good or evil, burning from its birth,<br/>  The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,<br/>And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:<br/>  Beauty and love were Haid√©e's mother's dower;<br/>But her large dark eye showed deep Passion's force,<br/>Though sleeping like a lion near a source.<br/><br/>Her daughter, tempered with a milder ray,<br/>  Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,<br/>Till slowly charged with thunder they display<br/>  Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,<br/>Had held till now her soft and milky way;<br/>  But overwrought with Passion and Despair,<br/>The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,<br/>Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.<br/><br/>The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,<br/>  And he himself o'ermastered and cut down;<br/>His blood was running on the very floor<br/>  Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;<br/>Thus much she viewed an instant and no more,--<br/>  Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;<br/>On her Sire's arm, which until now scarce held<br/>Her writhing, fell she like a cedar felled.<br/><br/>A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes<br/>  Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;<br/>And her head drooped, as when the lily lies<br/>  O'ercharged with rain: her summoned handmaids bore<br/>Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;<br/>  Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,<br/>But she defied all means they could employ,<br/>Like one Life could not hold, nor Death destroy.<br/><br/>Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill--<br/>  With nothing livid, still her lips were red;<br/>She had no pulse, but Death seemed absent still;<br/>  No hideous sign proclaimed her surely dead;<br/>Corruption came not in each mind to kill<br/>  All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred<br/>New thoughts of Life, for it seemed full of soul--<br/>She had so much, Earth could not claim the whole.<br/><br/>The ruling passion, such as marble shows<br/>  When exquisitely chiselled, still lay there,<br/>But fixed as marble's unchanged aspect throws<br/>  O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;<br/>O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,<br/>  And ever-dying Gladiator's air,<br/>Their energy like life forms all their fame,<br/>Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.--<br/><br/>She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,<br/>  Rather the dead, for Life seemed something new,<br/>A strange sensation which she must partake<br/>  Perforce, since whatsoever met her view<br/>Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache<br/>  Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true<br/>Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,<br/>For, for a while, the Furies made a pause.<br/><br/>She looked on many a face with vacant eye,<br/>  On many a token without knowing what:<br/>She saw them watch her without asking why,<br/>  And recked not who around her pillow sat;<br/>Not speechless, though she spoke not--not a sigh<br/>  Relieved her thoughts--dull silence and quick chat<br/>Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave<br/>No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.<br/><br/>Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;<br/>  Her Father watched, she turned her eyes away;<br/>She recognised no being, and no spot,<br/>  However dear or cherished in their day;<br/>They changed from room to room--but all forgot--<br/>  Gentle, but without memory she lay;<br/>At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning<br/>Back to old thoughts, waxed full of fearful meaning.<br/><br/>And then a slave bethought her of a harp;<br/>  The harper came, and tuned his instrument;<br/>At the first notes, irregular and sharp,<br/>  On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,<br/>Then to the wall she turned as if to warp<br/>  Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;<br/>And he began a long low island-song<br/>Of ancient days, ere Tyranny grew strong.<br/><br/>Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall<br/>  In time to his old tune: he changed the theme,<br/>And sung of Love; the fierce name struck through all<br/>  Her recollection; on her flashed the dream<br/>Of what she was, and is, if ye could call<br/>  To be so being; in a gushing stream<br/>The tears rushed forth from her o'erclouded brain,<br/>Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.<br/><br/>Short solace, vain relief!--Thought came too quick,<br/>  And whirled her brain to madness; she arose<br/>As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,<br/>  And flew at all she met, as on her foes;<br/>But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,<br/>  Although her paroxysm drew towards its close;--<br/>Hers was a frenzy which disdained to rave,<br/>Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.<br/><br/>Yet she betrayed at times a gleam of sense;<br/>  Nothing could make her meet her Father's face,<br/>Though on all other things with looks intense<br/>  She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;<br/>Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence<br/>  Availed for either; neither change of place,<br/>Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her<br/>Senses to sleep--the power seemed gone for ever.<br/><br/>Twelve days and nights she withered thus; at last,<br/>  Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show<br/>A parting pang, the spirit from her passed:<br/>  And they who watched her nearest could not know<br/>The very instant, till the change that cast<br/>  Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,<br/>Glazed o'er her eyes--the beautiful, the black--<br/>Oh! to possess such lustre--and then lack!<br/><br/>She died, but not alone; she held, within,<br/>  A second principle of Life, which might<br/>Have dawned a fair and sinless child of sin;<br/>  But closed its little being without light,<br/>And went down to the grave unborn, wherein<br/>  Blossom and bough lie withered with one blight;<br/>In vain the dews of Heaven descend above<br/>The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of Love.<br/><br/>Thus lived--thus died she; never more on her<br/>  Shall Sorrow light, or Shame. She was not made<br/>Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,<br/>  Which colder hearts endure till they are laid<br/>By age in earth: her days and pleasures were<br/>  Brief, but delightful--such as had not staid<br/>Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well<br/>By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.<br/><br/>That isle is now all desolate and bare,<br/>  Its dwellings down, its tenants passed away;<br/>None but her own and Father's grave is there,<br/>  And nothing outward tells of human clay;<br/>Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,<br/>  No stone is there to show, no tongue to say,<br/>What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,<br/>Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.<br/><br/>But many a Greek maid in a loving song<br/>  Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander<br/>With her Sire's story makes the night less long;<br/>  Valour was his, and Beauty dwelt with her:<br/>If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong--<br/>  A heavy price must all pay who thus err,<br/>In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,<br/>For soon or late Love is his own avenger.<br/><br/>But let me change this theme, which grows too sad,<br/>  And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;<br/>I don't much like describing people mad,<br/>  For fear of seeming rather touched myself--<br/>Besides, I've no more on this head to add;<br/>  And as my Muse is a capricious elf,<br/>We'll put about, and try another tack<br/>With Juan, left half-killed some stanzas back.<br/><br/>Wounded and fettered, "cabined, cribbed, confined,"<br/>  Some days and nights elapsed before that he<br/>Could altogether call the past to mind;<br/>  And when he did, he found himself at sea,<br/>Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;<br/>  The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee--<br/>Another time he might have liked to see 'em,<br/>But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigeum.<br/><br/>There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is<br/>  (Flanked by the Hellespont, and by the sea)<br/>Entombed the bravest of the brave, Achilles;<br/>  They say so--(Bryant says the contrary):<br/>And further downward, tall and towering still, is<br/>  The tumulus--of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be<br/>Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus--<br/>All heroes, who if living still would slay us.<br/><br/>High barrows, without marble, or a name,<br/>  A vast, untilled, and mountain-skirted plain,<br/>And Ida in the distance, still the same,<br/>  And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;<br/>The situation seems still formed for fame--<br/>  A hundred thousand men might fight again,<br/>With ease; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,<br/>The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;<br/><br/>Troops of untended horses; here and there<br/>  Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;<br/>Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare<br/>  A moment at the European youth<br/>Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;<br/>  A Turk, with beads in hand, and pipe in mouth,<br/>Extremely taken with his own religion,<br/>Are what I found there--but the devil a Phrygian.<br/><br/>Don Juan, here permitted to emerge<br/>  From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;<br/>Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,<br/>  O'ershadowed there by many a Hero's grave;<br/>Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge<br/>  A few brief questions; and the answers gave<br/>No very satisfactory information<br/>About his past or present situation.<br/><br/>He saw some fellow captives, who appeared<br/>  To be Italians (as they were in fact)--<br/>From them, at least, _their_ destiny he heard,<br/>  Which was an odd one; a troop going to act<br/>In Sicily--all singers, duly reared<br/>  In their vocation, had not been attacked<br/>In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,<br/>But sold by the _impresario_ at no high rate.<br/><br/>By one of these, the _buffo_ of the party,<br/>  Juan was told about their curious case;<br/>For although destined to the Turkish mart, he<br/>  Still kept his spirits up--at least his face;<br/>The little fellow really looked quite hearty,<br/>  And bore him with some gaiety and grace,<br/>Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,<br/>Than did the prima donna and the tenor.<br/><br/>In a few words he told their hapless story,<br/>  Saying, "Our Machiavelian _impresario_,<br/>Making a signal off some promontory,<br/>  Hailed a strange brig--_Corpo di Caio Mario!_<br/>We were transferred on board her in a hurry,<br/>  Without a single scudo of _salario_;<br/>But if the Sultan has a taste for song,<br/>We will revive our fortunes before long.<br/><br/>"The prima donna, though a little old,<br/>  And haggard with a dissipated life,<br/>And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,<br/>  Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,<br/>With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;<br/>  Last carnival she made a deal of strife,<br/>By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna<br/>From an old Roman Princess at Bologna.<br/><br/>"And then there are the dancers; there's the Nini,<br/>  With more than one profession gains by all;<br/>Then there's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,<br/>  She, too, was fortunate last Carnival,<br/>And made at least five hundred good _zecchini_,<br/>  But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;<br/>And then there's the Grotesca--such a dancer!<br/>Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.<br/><br/>"As for the _figuranti_, they are like<br/>  The rest of all that tribe;

these two hated with a hate<br/>Found only on the stage, and each more pained<br/>  With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;<br/>Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grained,<br/>  Instead of bearing up without debate,<br/>That each pulled different ways with many an oath,<br/>"Arcades ambo," _id est_--blackguards both.<br/><br/>Juan's companion was a Romagnole,<br/>  But bred within the march of old Ancona,<br/>With eyes that looked into the very soul<br/>  (And other chief points of a _bella donna_),<br/>Bright--and as black and burning as a coal;<br/>  And through her clear brunette complexion shone a<br/>Great wish to please--a most attractive dower,<br/>Especially when added to the power.<br/><br/>But all that power was wasted upon him,<br/>  For Sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;<br/>Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim:<br/>  And though thus chained, as natural her hand<br/>Touched his, nor that--nor any handsome limb<br/>  (And she had some not easy to withstand)<br/>Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;<br/>Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.<br/><br/>No matter;

nothing very rare--<br/>Six Tartars and a drag-chain----"--"To this doom<br/>  But what conducted, if the question 's fair,<br/>Is that which I would learn."--"I served for some<br/>  Months with the Russian army here and there;<br/>And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,<br/>A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin."<br/><br/>"Have you no friends?"--"I had--but, by God's blessing,<br/>  Have not been troubled with them lately. Now<br/>I have answered all your questions without pressing,<br/>  And you an equal courtesy should show."<br/>"Alas!" said Juan, "'t were a tale distressing,<br/>  And long besides."--"Oh! if 't is really so,<br/>You're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;<br/>A sad tale saddens doubly when 't is long.<br/><br/>"But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,<br/>  Although a female moderately fickle,<br/>Will hardly leave you (as she's not your wife)<br/>  For any length of days in such a pickle.<br/>To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife<br/>  As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:<br/>Men are the sport of circumstances, when<br/>The circumstances seem the sport of men."<br/><br/>"'T is not," said Juan, "for my present doom<br/>  I mourn, but for the past;--I loved a maid:"--<br/>He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;<br/>  A single tear upon his eyelash staid<br/>A moment, and then dropped; "but to resume,<br/>  'Tis not my present lot, as I have said,<br/>Which I deplore so much; for I have borne<br/>Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,<br/><br/>"On the rough deep. But this last blow--" and here<br/>  He stopped again, and turned away his face.<br/>"Aye," quoth his friend, "I thought it would appear<br/>  That there had been a lady in the case;<br/>And these are things which ask a tender tear,<br/>  Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:<br/>I cried upon my first wife's dying day,<br/>And also when my second ran away:<br/><br/>"My third----"--"Your third!" quoth Juan, turning round;<br/>  "You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?"<br/>"No--only two at present above ground:<br/>  Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see<br/>One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!"<br/>  "Well, then, your third," said Juan; "what did she?<br/>She did not run away, too,--did she, sir?"<br/>"No, faith."--"What then?"--"I ran away from her."<br/><br/>"You take things coolly, sir," said Juan. "Why,"<br/>  Replied the other, "what can a man do?<br/>There still are many rainbows in your sky,<br/>  But mine have vanished.

for they are little skilled in<br/>  The arts of which these lands were once the font:<br/>Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen<br/>New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.<br/><br/>And nearer as they came, a genial savour<br/>  Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,<br/>Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,<br/>  Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,<br/>And put himself upon his good behaviour:<br/>  His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,<br/>Said, "In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,<br/>And then I'm with you, if you're for a row."<br/><br/>Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,<br/>  Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;<br/>The last of these was never much the fashion,<br/>  For Reason thinks all reasoning out of season:<br/>Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,<br/>  But more or less continue still to tease on,<br/>With arguments according to their "forte:"<br/>But no one ever dreams of being short.--<br/><br/>But I digress: of all appeals,--although<br/>  I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,<br/>Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,--no<br/>  Method's more sure at moments to take hold<br/>Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow<br/>  More tender, as we every day behold,<br/>Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,<br/>The Tocsin of the Soul--the dinner-bell.<br/><br/>Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;<br/>  And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard<br/>No Christian knoll to table, saw no line<br/>  Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,<br/>Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,<br/>  And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,<br/>And gazed around them to the left and right,<br/>With the prophetic eye of appetite.<br/><br/>And giving up all notions of resistance,<br/>  They followed close behind their sable guide,<br/>Who little thought that his own cracked existence<br/>  Was on the point of being set aside:<br/>He motioned them to stop at some small distance,<br/>  And knocking at the gate, 't was opened wide,<br/>And a magnificent large hall displayed<br/>The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.<br/><br/>I won't describe; description is my "forte,"<br/>  But every fool describes in these bright days<br/>His wondrous journey to some foreign court,<br/>  And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise--<br/>Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;<br/>  While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,<br/>Resigns herself with exemplary patience<br/>To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.<br/><br/>Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted<br/>  Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;<br/>Others in monosyllable talk chatted,<br/>  And some seemed much in love with their own dress;<br/>And divers smoked superb pipes decorated<br/>  With amber mouths of greater price or less;<br/>And several strutted, others slept, and some<br/>Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.<br/><br/>As the black eunuch entered with his brace<br/>  Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes<br/>A moment, without slackening from their pace;<br/>  But those who sate ne'er stirred in any wise:<br/>One or two stared the captives in the face,<br/>  Just as one views a horse to guess his price;<br/>Some nodded to the negro from their station,<br/>But no one troubled him with conversation.<br/><br/>He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,<br/>  On through a farther range of goodly rooms,<br/>Splendid, but silent, save in _one_, where dropping<br/>  A marble fountain echoes through the glooms<br/>Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping<br/>  Some female head most curiously presumes<br/>To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,<br/>As wondering what the _devil_ noise that is!<br/><br/>Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls<br/>  Gave light enough to hint their farther way,<br/>But not enough to show the imperial halls<br/>  In all the flashing of their full array;<br/>Perhaps there's nothing--I'll not say appals,<br/>  But saddens more by night as well as day,<br/>Than an enormous room without a soul<br/>To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.<br/><br/>Two or three seem so little, _one_ seems nothing:<br/>  In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,<br/>_There_ Solitude, we know, has her full growth in<br/>  The spots which were her realms for evermore;<br/>But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in<br/>  More modern buildings and those built of yore,<br/>A kind of Death comes o'er us all alone,<br/>Seeing what's meant for many with but one.<br/><br/>A neat, snug study on a winter's night,<br/>  A book, friend, single lady, or a glass<br/>Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,<br/>  Are things which make an English evening pass--<br/>Though _certes_ by no means so grand a sight<br/>  As is a theatre lit up by gas--<br/>_I_ pass my evenings in long galleries solely,<br/>And that's the reason I'm so melancholy.<br/><br/>Alas! Man makes that great which makes him little--<br/>  I grant you in a church 't is very well:<br/>What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,<br/>  But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell<br/>Their names who reared it; but huge houses fit ill,<br/>  And huge tombs, worse, Mankind--since Adam fell:<br/>Methinks the story of the tower of Babel<br/>Might teach them this much better than I'm able.<br/><br/>Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then<br/>  A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,<br/>Where Nabuchadonosor, King of men,<br/>  Reigned, till one summer's day he took to grazing,<br/>And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,<br/>  The people's awe and admiration raising;<br/>'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,<br/>And the calumniated queen Semiramis--<br/><br/>That injured Queen, by chroniclers so coarse,<br/>  Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)<br/>Of an improper friendship for her horse<br/>  (Love, like Religion, sometimes runs to heresy):<br/>This monstrous tale had probably its source<br/>  (For such exaggerations here and there I see)<br/>In writing "Courser" by mistake for "Courier:"<br/>I wish the case could come before a jury here.<br/><br/>But to resume,--should there be (what may not<br/>  Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,<br/>Because they can't find out the very spot<br/>  Of that same Babel, or because they won't<br/>(Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,<br/>  And written lately two memoirs upon't),<br/>Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who<br/>Must be believed, though they believe not you:<br/><br/>Yet let them think that Horace has expressed<br/>  Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly<br/>Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,<br/>  Who give themselves to Architecture wholly;<br/>We know where things and men must end at best:<br/>  A moral (like all morals) melancholy,<br/>And "Et sepulchri immemor struis domos"<br/>Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.<br/><br/>At last they reached a quarter most retired,<br/>  Where Echo woke as if from a long slumber;<br/>Though full of all things which could be desired,<br/>  One wondered what to do with such a number<br/>Of articles which nobody required;<br/>  Here Wealth had done its utmost to encumber<br/>With furniture an exquisite apartment,<br/>Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.<br/><br/>It seemed, however, but to open on<br/>  A range or suite of further chambers, which<br/>Might lead to Heaven knows where; but in this one<br/>  The moveables were prodigally rich:<br/>Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,<br/>  So costly were they; carpets every stitch<br/>Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish<br/>You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.<br/><br/>The black, however, without hardly deigning<br/>  A glance at that which wrapped the slaves in wonder,<br/>Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,<br/>  As if the milky way their feet was under<br/>With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining<br/>  A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder,<br/>In that remote recess which you may see--<br/>Or if you don't the fault is not in me,--<br/><br/>I wish to be perspicuous--and the black,<br/>  I say, unlocking the recess, pulled forth<br/>A quantity of clothes fit for the back<br/>  Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth:<br/>And of variety there was no lack--<br/>  And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,--<br/>He chose himself to point out what he thought<br/>Most proper for the Christians he had bought.<br/><br/>The suit he thought most suitable to each<br/>  Was, for the elder and the stouter, first<br/>A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,<br/>  And trousers not so tight that they would burst,<br/>But such as fit an Asiatic breech;<br/>  A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nursed,<br/>Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;<br/>In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.<br/><br/>While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,<br/>  Hinted the vast advantages which they<br/>Might probably attain both in the end,<br/>  If they would but pursue the proper way<br/>Which Fortune plainly seemed to recommend;<br/>  And then he added, that he needs must say,<br/>"'T would greatly tend to better their condition,<br/>If they would condescend to circumcision.<br/><br/>"For his own part, he really should rejoice<br/>  To see them true believers, but no less<br/>Would leave his proposition to their choice."<br/>  The other, thanking him for this excess<br/>Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice<br/>  In such a trifle, scarcely could express<br/>"Sufficiently" (he said) "his approbation<br/>Of all the customs of this polished nation.<br/><br/>"For his own share--he saw but small objection<br/>  To so respectable an ancient rite;<br/>And, after swallowing down a slight refection,<br/>  For which he owned a present appetite,<br/>He doubted not a few hours of reflection<br/>  Would reconcile him to the business quite."<br/>"Will it?" said Juan, sharply: "Strike me dead,<br/>But they as soon shall circumcise my head!<br/><br/>"Cut off a thousand heads, before----"--"Now, pray,"<br/>  Replied the other, "do not interrupt:<br/>You put me out in what I had to say.<br/>  Sir!--as I said, as soon as I have supped,<br/>I shall perpend if your proposal may<br/>  Be such as I can properly accept;<br/>Provided always your great goodness still<br/>Remits the matter to our own free-will."<br/><br/>Baba eyed Juan, and said, "Be so good<br/>  As dress yourself--" and pointed out a suit<br/>In which a Princess with great pleasure would<br/>  Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,<br/>As not being in a masquerading mood,<br/>  Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;<br/>And when the old negro told him to "Get ready,"<br/>Replied, "Old gentleman, I'm not a lady."<br/><br/>"What you may be, I neither know nor care,"<br/>  Said Baba; "but pray do as I desire:<br/>I have no more time nor many words to spare."<br/>  "At least," said Juan, "sure I may inquire<br/>The cause of this odd travesty?"--"Forbear,"<br/>  Said Baba, "to be curious; 't will transpire,<br/>No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:<br/>I have no authority to tell the reason."<br/><br/>"Then if I do," said Juan, "I'll be----"--"Hold!"<br/>  Rejoined the negro, "pray be not provoking;<br/>This spirit's well, but it may wax too bold,<br/>  And you will find us not too fond of joking."<br/>"What, sir!" said Juan, "shall it e'er be told<br/>  That I unsexed my dress?" But Baba, stroking<br/>The things down, said, "Incense me, and I call<br/>Those who will leave you of no sex at all.<br/><br/>"I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:<br/>  A woman's, true; but then there is a cause<br/>Why you should wear them."--"What, though my soul loathes<br/>  The effeminate garb?"--thus, after a short pause,<br/>Sighed Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,<br/>  "What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?"<br/>Thus he profanely termed the finest lace<br/>Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.<br/><br/>And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipped<br/>  A pair of trousers of flesh-coloured silk;<br/>Next with a virgin zone he was equipped,<br/>  Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;<br/>But tugging on his petticoat, he tripped,<br/>  Which--as we say--or as the Scotch say, _whilk_.<br/>(The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes<br/>Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)--<br/><br/>Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to<br/>  His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:<br/>And yet at last he managed to get through<br/>  His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:<br/>The negro Baba helped a little too,<br/>  When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;<br/>And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,<br/>He paused, and took a survey up and down.<br/><br/>One difficulty still remained--his hair<br/>  Was hardly long enough; but Baba found<br/>So many false long tresses all to spare,<br/>  That soon his head was most completely crowned,<br/>After the manner then in fashion there;<br/>  And this addition with such gems was bound<br/>As suited the _ensemble_ of his toilet,<br/>While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.<br/><br/>And now being femininely all arrayed,<br/>  With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,<br/>He looked in almost all respects a maid,<br/>  And Baba smilingly exclaimed, "You see, sirs,<br/>A perfect transformation here displayed;<br/>  And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,<br/>That is--the Lady:" clapping his hands twice,<br/>Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.<br/><br/>"You, sir," said Baba, nodding to the one,<br/>  "Will please to accompany those gentlemen<br/>To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,<br/>  Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when<br/>I say a thing, it must at once be done.<br/>  What fear you? think you this a lion's den?<br/>Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise<br/>Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.<br/><br/>"You fool! I tell you no one means you harm."<br/>  "So much the better," Juan said, "for them;<br/>Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,<br/>  Which is not quite so light as you may deem.<br/>I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm,<br/>  If any take me for that which I seem:<br/>So that I trust for every body's sake,<br/>That this disguise may lead to no mistake."<br/><br/>"Blockhead! come on, and see," quoth Baba; while<br/>  Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who<br/>Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile<br/>  Upon the metamorphosis in view,--<br/>"Farewell!" they mutually exclaimed: "this soil<br/>  Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;<br/>One's turned half Mussulman, and one a maid,<br/>By this old black enchanter's unsought aid."<br/><br/>"Farewell!" said Juan: "should we meet no more,<br/>  I wish you a good appetite."--"Farewell!"<br/>Replied the other; "though it grieves me sore:<br/>  When we next meet, we'll have a tale to tell:<br/>We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.<br/>  Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell."<br/>"Nay," quoth the maid, "the Sultan's self shan't carry me,<br/>Unless his Highness promises to marry me."<br/><br/>And thus they parted, each by separate doors;<br/>  Baba led Juan onward, room by room,<br/>Through glittering galleries, and o'er marble floors,<br/>  Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,<br/>Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;<br/>  And wafted far arose a rich perfume:<br/>It seemed as though they came upon a shrine,<br/>For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.<br/><br/>The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,<br/>  Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;<br/>Warriors thereon were battling furiously;<br/>  Here stalks the victor, there the vanquished lies;<br/>There captives led in triumph droop the eye,<br/>  And in perspective many a squadron flies:<br/>It seems the work of times before the line<br/>Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.<br/><br/>This massy portal stood at the wide close<br/>  Of a huge hall, and on its either side<br/>Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,<br/>  Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied<br/>In mockery to the enormous gate which rose<br/>  O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:<br/>The gate so splendid was in all its _features_,<br/>You never thought about those little creatures,<br/><br/>Until you nearly trod on them, and then<br/>  You started back in horror to survey<br/>The wondrous hideousness of those small men,<br/>  Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,<br/>But an extraneous mixture, which no pen<br/>  Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;<br/>They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--<br/>Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.<br/><br/>Their duty was--for they were strong, and though<br/>  They looked so little, did strong things at times--<br/>To ope this door, which they could really do,<br/>  The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;<br/>And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,<br/>  As is the custom of those Eastern climes,<br/>To give some rebel Pacha a cravat--<br/>For mutes are generally used for that.<br/><br/>They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;<br/>  And looking like two Incubi, they glared<br/>As Baba with his fingers made them fall<br/>  To heaving back the portal folds: it scared<br/>Juan a moment, as this pair so small,<br/>  With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;<br/>It was as if their little looks could poison<br/>Or fascinate whome'er they fixed their eyes on.<br/><br/>Before they entered, Baba paused to hint<br/>  To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:<br/>"If you could just contrive," he said, "to stint<br/>  That somewhat manly majesty of stride,<br/>'T would be as well, and--(though there's not much in 't)<br/>  To swing a little less from side to side,<br/>Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;--<br/>And also could you look a little modest,<br/><br/>"'T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes<br/>  Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;<br/>And if they should discover your disguise,<br/>  You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;<br/>And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,<br/>  To find our way to Marmora without boats,<br/>Stitched up in sacks--a mode of navigation<br/>A good deal practised here upon occasion."<br/><br/>With this encouragement he led the way<br/>  Into a room still nobler than the last;<br/>A rich confusion formed a disarray<br/>  In such sort, that the eye along it cast<br/>Could hardly carry anything away,<br/>  Object on object flashed so bright and fast;<br/>A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,<br/>Magnificently mingled in a litter.<br/><br/>Wealth had done wonders--taste not much; such things<br/>  Occur in Orient palaces, and even<br/>In the more chastened domes of Western kings<br/>  (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),<br/>Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings<br/>  Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;<br/>Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,<br/>On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.<br/><br/>In this imperial hall, at distance lay<br/>  Under a canopy, and there reclined<br/>Quite in a confidential queenly way,<br/>  A lady; Baba stopped, and kneeling signed<br/>To Juan, who though not much used to pray,<br/>  Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind<br/>What all this meant: while Baba bowed and bended<br/>His head, until the ceremony ended.<br/><br/>The lady rising up with such an air<br/>  As Venus rose with from the wave, on them<br/>Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair<br/>  Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;<br/>And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,<br/>  She signed to Baba, who first kissed the hem<br/>Of her deep purple robe, and, speaking low,<br/>Pointed to Juan who remained below.<br/><br/>Her presence was as lofty as her state;<br/>  Her beauty of that overpowering kind,<br/>Whose force Description only would abate:<br/>  I'd rather leave it much to your own mind,<br/>Than lessen it by what I could relate<br/>  Of forms and features; it would strike you blind<br/>Could I do justice to the full detail;<br/>So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.<br/><br/>Thus much however I may add,--her years<br/>  Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs,<br/>But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,<br/>  And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things:<br/>Such as was Mary's, Queen of Scots; true--tears<br/>  And Love destroy; and sapping Sorrow wrings<br/>Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow<br/>Ugly; for instance--Ninon de l'Enclos.<br/><br/>She spake some words to her attendants, who<br/>  Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,<br/>And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,<br/>  Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen:<br/>They formed a very nymph-like looking crew,<br/>  Which might have called Diana's chorus "cousin,"<br/>As far as outward show may correspond--<br/>I won't be bail for anything beyond.<br/><br/>They bowed obeisance and withdrew, retiring,<br/>  But not by the same door through which came in<br/>Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,<br/>  At some small distance, all he saw within<br/>This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring<br/>  Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;<br/>And I must say, I ne'er could see the very<br/>Great happiness of the "Nil admirari."<br/><br/>"Not to admire is all the art I know<br/>  (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)--<br/>To make men happy, or to keep them so"<br/>  (So take it in the very words of Creech)--<br/>Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;<br/>  And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach<br/>From his translation; but had _none admired_,<br/>Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?<br/><br/>Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,<br/>  Motioned to Juan to approach, and then<br/>A second time desired him to kneel down,<br/>  And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when<br/>He heard repeated, Juan with a frown<br/>  Drew himself up to his full height again,<br/>And said, "It grieved him, but he could not stoop<br/>To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope."<br/><br/>Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,<br/>  Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat<br/>He muttered (but the last was given aside)<br/>  About a bow-string--quite in vain; not yet<br/>Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:<br/>  There's nothing in the world like _etiquette_<br/>In kingly chambers or imperial halls,<br/>As also at the Race and County Balls.<br/><br/>He stood like Atlas, with a world of words<br/>  About his ears, and nathless would not bend;<br/>The blood of all his line's Castilian lords<br/>  Boiled in his veins, and, rather than descend<br/>To stain his pedigree, a thousand swords<br/>  A thousand times of him had made an end;<br/>At length perceiving the "_foot_" could not stand,<br/>Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand,<br/><br/>Here was an honourable compromise,<br/>  A half-way house of diplomatic rest,<br/>Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;<br/>  And Juan now his willingness expressed<br/>To use all fit and proper courtesies,<br/>  Adding, that this was commonest and best,<br/>For through the South, the custom still commands<br/>The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.<br/><br/>And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,<br/>  Though on more _thorough-bred_ or fairer fingers<br/>No lips e'er left their transitory trace:<br/>  On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,<br/>And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,<br/>  As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers<br/>In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's<br/>An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.<br/><br/>The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade<br/>  Baba retire, which he obeyed in style,<br/>As if well used to the retreating trade;<br/>  And taking hints in good part all the while,<br/>He whispered Juan not to be afraid,<br/>  And looking on him with a sort of smile,<br/>Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction,<br/>As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.<br/><br/>When he was gone, there was a sudden change:<br/>  I know not what might be the lady's thought,<br/>But o'er her bright brow flashed a tumult strange,<br/>  And into her clear cheek the blood was brought,<br/>Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range<br/>  The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,<br/>A mixture of sensations might be scanned,<br/>Of half voluptuousness and half command.<br/><br/>Her form had all the softness of her sex,<br/>  Her features all the sweetness of the Devil,<br/>When he put on the Cherub to perplex<br/>  Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;<br/>The Sun himself was scarce more free from specks<br/>  Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;<br/>Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,<br/>As if she rather _ordered_ than was _granting_.--<br/><br/>Something imperial, or imperious, threw<br/>  A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain<br/>Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,--<br/>  And Rapture's self will seem almost a pain<br/>With aught which looks like despotism in view;<br/>  Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain<br/>We would against them make the flesh obey--<br/>The spirit in the end will have its way.<br/><br/>Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;<br/>  Her very nod was not an inclination;<br/>There was a self-will even in her small feet,<br/>  As though they were quite conscious of her station--<br/>They trod as upon necks; and to complete<br/>  Her state (it is the custom of her nation),<br/>A poniard decked her girdle, as the sign<br/>She was a Sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).<br/><br/>"To hear and to obey" had been from birth<br/>  The law of all around her; to fulfil<br/>All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,<br/>  Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;<br/>Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:<br/>  Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;<br/>Had she but been a Christian, I've a notion<br/>We should have found out the "perpetual motion."<br/><br/>Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;<br/>  Whate'er she did _not_ see, if she supposed<br/>It might be seen, with diligence was sought,<br/>  And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed:<br/>There was no end unto the things she bought,<br/>  Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;<br/>Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,<br/>The women pardoned all except her face.<br/><br/>Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught<br/>  Her eye in passing on his way to sale;<br/>She ordered him directly to be bought,<br/>  And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail<br/>In any kind of mischief to be wrought,<br/>  At all such auctions knew how to prevail:<br/>She had no prudence, but he had--and this<br/>Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.<br/><br/>His youth and features favoured the disguise,<br/>  And should you ask how she, a Sultan's bride,<br/>Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,<br/>  This I must leave sultanas to decide:<br/>Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,<br/>  And kings and consorts oft are mystified,<br/>As we may ascertain with due precision,<br/>Some by experience, others by tradition.<br/><br/>But to the main point, where we have been tending:--<br/>  She now conceived all difficulties past,<br/>And deemed herself extremely condescending<br/>  When, being made her property at last,<br/>Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending<br/>  Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,<br/>And merely saying, "Christian, canst thou love?"<br/>Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move.<br/><br/>And so it was, in proper time and place;<br/>  But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing<br/>With Haid√©e's isle and soft Ionian face,<br/>  Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing<br/>Rush back upon his heart, which filled apace,<br/>  And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing:<br/>These words went through his soul like Arab spears,<br/>So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.<br/><br/>She was a good deal shocked; not shocked at tears,<br/>  For women shed and use them at their liking;<br/>But there is something when man's eye appears<br/>  Wet, still more disagreeable and striking:<br/>A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,<br/>  Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in<br/>His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)<br/>To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.<br/><br/>And she would have consoled, but knew not how:<br/>  Having no equals, nothing which had e'er<br/>Infected her with sympathy till now,<br/>  And never having dreamt what 't was to bear<br/>Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although<br/>  There might arise some pouting petty care<br/>To cross her brow, she wondered how so near<br/>Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.<br/><br/>But Nature teaches more than power can spoil,<br/>  And, when a strong although a strange sensation<br/>Moves--female hearts are such a genial soil<br/>  For kinder feelings, whatso'er their nation,<br/>They naturally pour the "wine and oil,"<br/>  Samaritans in every situation;<br/>And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,<br/>Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.<br/><br/>But tears must stop like all things else; and soon<br/>  Juan, who for an instant had been moved<br/>To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone<br/>  Of one who dared to ask if "he _had_ loved,"<br/>Called back the Stoic to his eyes, which shone<br/>  Bright with the very weakness he reproved;<br/>And although sensitive to beauty, he<br/>Felt most indignant still at not being free.<br/><br/>Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,<br/>  Was much embarrassed, never having met<br/>In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;<br/>  And as she also risked her life to get<br/>Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways<br/>  Into a comfortable t√™te-√†-t√™te,<br/>To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,<br/>And they had wasted now almost a quarter.<br/><br/>I also would suggest the fitting time<br/>  To gentlemen in any such like case,<br/>That is to say in a meridian clime--<br/>  With us there is more law given to the chase,<br/>But here a small delay forms a great crime:<br/>  So recollect that the extremest grace<br/>Is just two minutes for your declaration--<br/>A moment more would hurt your reputation.<br/><br/>Juan's was good; and might have been still better,<br/>  But he had got Haid√©e into his head:<br/>However strange, he could not yet forget her,<br/>  Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.<br/>Gulbeyaz, who looked on him as her debtor<br/>  For having had him to her palace led,<br/>Began to blush up to the eyes, and then<br/>Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.<br/><br/>At length, in an imperial way, she laid<br/>  Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes<br/>Which needed not an empire to persuade,<br/>  Looked into his for love, where none replies:<br/>Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,<br/>  That being the last thing a proud woman tries;<br/>She rose, and pausing one chaste moment threw<br/>Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.<br/><br/>This was an awkward test, as Juan found,<br/>  But he was steeled by Sorrow, Wrath, and Pride:<br/>With gentle force her white arms he unwound,<br/>  And seated her all drooping by his side,<br/>Then rising haughtily he glanced around,<br/>  And looking coldly in her face he cried,<br/>"The prisoned eagle will not pair, nor I<br/>Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.<br/><br/>"Thou ask'st, if I can love? be this the proof<br/>  How much I _have_ loved--that I love not _thee!_<br/>In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,<br/>  Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!<br/>I am not dazzled by this splendid roof;<br/>  Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be,<br/>Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,<br/>And hands obey--our hearts are still our own."<br/><br/>This was a truth to us extremely trite;<br/>  Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:<br/>She deemed her least command must yield delight,<br/>  Earth being only made for Queens and Kings.<br/>If hearts lay on the left side or the right<br/>  She hardly knew, to such perfection brings<br/>Legitimacy its born votaries, when<br/>Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.<br/><br/>Besides, as has been said, she was so fair<br/>  As even in a much humbler lot had made<br/>A kingdom or confusion anywhere,<br/>  And also, as may be presumed, she laid<br/>Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,<br/>  By their possessors thrown into the shade:<br/>She thought hers gave a double "right divine;"<br/>And half of that opinion's also mine.<br/><br/>Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,<br/>  Ye! who have kept your chastity when young,<br/>While some more desperate dowager has been waging<br/>  Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung<br/>By your refusal, recollect her raging!<br/>  Or recollect all that was said or sung<br/>On such a subject; then suppose the face<br/>Of a young downright beauty in this case!<br/><br/>Suppose,--but you already have supposed,<br/>  The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,<br/>Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed<br/>  Of good examples; pity that so few by<br/>Poets and private tutors are exposed,<br/>  To educate--ye youth of Europe--you by!<br/>But when you have supposed the few we know,<br/>You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.<br/><br/>A tigress robbed of young, a lioness,<br/>  Or any interesting beast of prey,<br/>Are similes at hand for the distress<br/>  Of ladies who can _not_ have their own way;<br/>But though my turn will not be served with less,<br/>  These don't express one half what I should say:<br/>For what is stealing young ones, few or many,<br/>To cutting short their hope of having _any?_<br/><br/>The love of offspring's Nature's general law,<br/>  From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;<br/>There's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw<br/>  Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;<br/>And all who have seen a human nursery, saw<br/>  How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings:<br/>This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer<br/>Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.<br/><br/>If I said fire flashed from Gulbeyaz' eyes,<br/>  'T were nothing--for her eyes flashed always fire;<br/>Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,<br/>  I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,<br/>So supernatural was her passion's rise;<br/>  For ne'er till now she knew a checked desire:<br/>Even ye who know what a checked woman is<br/>(Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.<br/><br/>Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well--<br/>  A moment's more had slain her; but the while<br/>It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of Hell:<br/>  Nought's more sublime than energetic bile,<br/>Though horrible to see, yet grand to tell,<br/>  Like Ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;<br/>And the deep passions flashing through her form<br/>Made her a beautiful embodied storm.<br/><br/>A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon<br/>  To match a common fury with her rage,<br/>And yet she did not want to reach the moon,<br/>  Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;<br/>Her anger pitched into a lower tune,<br/>  Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age--<br/>Her wish was but to "kill, kill, kill," like Lear's,<br/>And then her thirst of blood was quenched in tears.<br/><br/>A storm it raged, and like the storm it passed,<br/>  Passed without words--in fact she could not speak;<br/>And then her sex's shame broke in at last,<br/>  A sentiment till then in her but weak,<br/>But now it flowed in natural and fast,<br/>  As water through an unexpected leak;<br/>For she felt humbled--and humiliation<br/>Is sometimes good for people in her station.<br/><br/>It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,<br/>  It also gently hints to them that others,<br/>Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;<br/>  That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,<br/>And works of the same pottery, bad or good,<br/>  Though not all born of the same sires and mothers;<br/>It teaches--Heaven knows only what it teaches,<br/>But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.<br/><br/>Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;<br/>  Her second, to cut only his--acquaintance;<br/>Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;<br/>  Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;<br/>Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;<br/>  Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence<br/>The lash to Baba:--but her grand resource<br/>Was to sit down again, and cry--of course.<br/><br/>She thought to stab herself, but then she had<br/>  The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;<br/>For Eastern stays are little made to pad,<br/>  So that a poniard pierces if 't is struck hard:<br/>She thought of killing Juan--but, poor lad!<br/>  Though he deserved it well for being so backward,<br/>The cutting off his head was not the art<br/>Most likely to attain her aim--his heart.<br/><br/>Juan was moved: he had made up his mind<br/>  To be impaled, or quartered as a dish<br/>For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,<br/>  Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,<br/>And thus heroically stood resigned,<br/>  Rather than sin--except to his own wish:<br/>But all his great preparatives for dying<br/>Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.<br/><br/>As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,<br/>  So Juan's virtue ebbed, I know not how;<br/>And first he wondered why he had refused;<br/>  And then, if matters could be made up now;<br/>And next his savage virtue he accused,<br/>  Just as a friar may accuse his vow,<br/>Or as a dame repents her of her oath,<br/>Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.<br/><br/>So he began to stammer some excuses;<br/>  But words are not enough in such a matter,<br/>Although you borrowed all that e'er the Muses<br/>  Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,<br/>Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;<br/>  Just as a languid smile began to flatter<br/>His peace was making, but, before he ventured<br/>Further, old Baba rather briskly entered.<br/><br/>"Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!"<br/>  ('T was thus he spake,) "and Empress of the Earth!<br/>Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,<br/>  Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,<br/>Your slave brings tidings--he hopes not too soon--<br/>  Which your sublime attention may be worth:<br/>The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,<br/>To hint that he is coming up this way."<br/><br/>"Is it," exclaimed Gulbeyaz, "as you say?<br/>  I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!<br/>But bid my women form the milky way.<br/>  Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning--<br/>And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,<br/>  And as you'd have me pardon your past scorning-----"<br/>Here they were interrupted by a humming<br/>Sound, and then by a cry, "The Sultan's coming!"<br/><br/>First came her damsels, a decorous file,<br/>  And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;<br/>The train might reach a quarter of a mile:<br/>  His Majesty was always so polite<br/>As to announce his visits a long while<br/>  Before he came, especially at night;<br/>For being the last wife of the Emperor,<br/>She was of course the favourite of the four.<br/><br/>His Highness was a man of solemn port,<br/>  Shawled to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,<br/>Snatched from a prison to preside at court,<br/>  His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;<br/>He was as good a sovereign of the sort<br/>  As any mentioned in the histories<br/>Of Cantemir, or Kn≈çllƒõs, where few shine<br/>Save Solyman, the glory of their line.<br/><br/>He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers<br/>  With more than "Oriental scrupulosity;"<br/>He left to his vizier all state affairs,<br/>  And showed but little royal curiosity:<br/>I know not if he had domestic cares--<br/>  No process proved connubial animosity;<br/>Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,<br/>Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.<br/><br/>If now and then there happened a slight slip,<br/>  Little was heard of criminal or crime;<br/>The story scarcely passed a single lip--<br/>  The sack and sea had settled all in time,<br/>From which the secret nobody could rip:<br/>  The public knew no more than does this rhyme;<br/>No scandals made the daily press a curse--<br/>Morals were better, and the fish no worse.<br/><br/>He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,<br/>  Was also certain that the earth was square,<br/>Because he had journeyed fifty miles, and found<br/>  No sign that it was circular anywhere;<br/>His empire also was without a bound:<br/>  'T is true, a little troubled here and there,<br/>By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,<br/>But then they never came to "the Seven Towers;"<br/><br/>Except in shape of envoys, who were sent<br/>  To lodge there when a war broke out, according<br/>To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant<br/>  Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in<br/>Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent<br/>  Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording<br/>Their lies, yclept despatches, without risk or<br/>The singeing of a single inky whisker.<br/><br/>He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,<br/>  Of whom all such as came of age were stowed,<br/>The former in a palace, where like nuns<br/>  They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,<br/>When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,<br/>  Sometimes at six years old--though this seems odd,<br/>'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw<br/>Must make a present to his sire-in-law.<br/><br/>His sons were kept in prison, till they grew<br/>  Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,<br/>One or the other, but which of the two<br/>  Could yet be known unto the fates alone;<br/>Meantime the education they went through<br/>  Was princely, as the proofs have always shown;<br/>So that the heir apparent still was found<br/>No less deserving to be hanged than crowned.<br/><br/>His Majesty saluted his fourth spouse<br/>  With all the ceremonies of his rank,<br/>Who cleared her sparkling eyes and smoothed her brows,<br/>  As suits a matron who has played a prank;<br/>These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,<br/>  To save the credit of their breaking bank:<br/>To no men are such cordial greetings given<br/>As those whose wives have made them fit for Heaven.<br/><br/>His Highness cast around his great black eyes,<br/>  And looking, as he always looked, perceived<br/>Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,<br/>  At which he seemed no whit surprised nor grieved,<br/>But just remarked with air sedate and wise,<br/>  While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,<br/>"I see you've bought another girl; 't is pity<br/>That a mere Christian should be half so pretty."<br/><br/>This compliment, which drew all eyes upon<br/>  The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.<br/>Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:<br/>  Oh! Mahomet! that his Majesty should take<br/>Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one<br/>  Of them his lips imperial ever spake!<br/>There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,<br/>But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.<br/><br/>The Turks do well to shut--at least, sometimes--<br/>  The women up--because, in sad reality,<br/>Their chastity in these unhappy climes<br/>  Is not a thing of that astringent quality<br/>Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,<br/>  And makes our snow less pure than our morality;<br/>The Sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,<br/>Has quite the contrary effect--on vice.<br/><br/>Thus in the East they are extremely strict,<br/>  And wedlock and a padlock mean the same:<br/>Excepting only when the former's picked<br/>  It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;<br/>Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when pricked:<br/>  But then their own polygamy's to blame;<br/>Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life<br/>Into that moral centaur, man and wife?<br/><br/>Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,<br/>  Though not for want of matter; but 't is time,<br/>According to the ancient epic laws,<br/>  To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.<br/>Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,<br/>  The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;<br/>Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps<br/>You'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.<br/><br/>CANTO THE SIXTH.<br/><br/>"There is a tide in the affairs of men,<br/>  Which,--taken at the flood,"--you know the rest,<br/>And most of us have found it now and then:<br/>  At least we think so, though but few have guessed<br/>The moment, till too late to come again.<br/>  But no doubt everything is for the best--<br/>Of which the surest sign is in the end:<br/>When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.<br/><br/>There is a tide in the affairs of women,<br/>  Which, taken at the flood, leads--God knows where:<br/>Those navigators must be able seamen<br/>  Whose charts lay down its currents to a hair;<br/>Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen<br/>  With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:<br/>Men with their heads reflect on this and that--<br/>But women with their hearts on Heaven knows what!<br/><br/>And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright She,<br/>  Young, beautiful, and daring--who would risk<br/>A throne--the world--the universe--to be<br/>  Beloved in her own way--and rather whisk<br/>The stars from out the sky, than not be free<br/>  As are the billows when the breeze is brisk--<br/>Though such a She's a devil (if there be one),<br/>Yet she would make full many a Manichean.<br/><br/>Thrones, worlds, _et cetera_, are so oft upset<br/>  By commonest ambition, that when Passion<br/>O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,<br/>  Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.<br/>If Anthony be well remembered yet,<br/>  'T is not his conquests keep his name in fashion,<br/>But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,<br/>Outbalances all C√¶sar's victories.<br/><br/>He died at fifty for a queen of forty;<br/>  I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,<br/>For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport--I<br/>  Remember when, though I had no great plenty<br/>Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I<br/>  Gave what I had--a heart; as the world went, I<br/>Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never<br/>Restore me those pure feelings, gone for ever.<br/><br/>'T was the boy's "mite," and, like the "widow's," may<br/>  Perhaps be weighed hereafter, if not now;<br/>But whether such things do or do not weigh,<br/>  All who have loved, or love, will still allow<br/>Life has nought like it. God is Love, they say,<br/>  And Love's a god, or was before the brow<br/>Of Earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears<br/>Of--but Chronology best knows the years.<br/><br/>We left our hero and third heroine in<br/>  A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,<br/>For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin<br/>  For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:<br/>Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,<br/>  And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,<br/>Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,<br/>Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.<br/><br/>I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;<br/>  I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;<br/>But I detest all fiction even in song,<br/>  And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.<br/>Her reason being weak, her passions strong,<br/>  She thought that her Lord's heart (even could she claim it)<br/>Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine<br/>Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.<br/><br/>I am not, like Cassio, "an arithmetician,"<br/>  But by "the bookish theoric" it appears,<br/>If 't is summed up with feminine precision,<br/>  That, adding to the account his Highness' years,<br/>The fair Sultana erred from inanition;<br/>  For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,<br/>She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part<br/>Of what should be monopoly--the heart.<br/><br/>It is observed that ladies are litigious<br/>  Upon all legal objects of possession,<br/>And not the least so when they are religious,<br/>  Which doubles what they think of the transgression:<br/>With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,<br/>  As the tribunals show through many a session,<br/>When they suspect that any one goes shares<br/>In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.<br/><br/>Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,<br/>  The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,<br/>Are apt to carry things with a high hand,<br/>  And take, what Kings call "an imposing attitude;"<br/>And for their rights connubial make a stand,<br/>  When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude;<br/>And as four wives must have quadruple claims,<br/>The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.<br/><br/>Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)<br/>  The favourite; but what's favour amongst four?<br/>Polygamy may well be held in dread,<br/>  Not only as a sin, but as a bore:<br/>Most wise men with one moderate woman wed,<br/>  Will scarcely find philosophy for more;<br/>And all (except Mahometans) forbear<br/>To make the nuptial couch a "Bed of Ware."<br/><br/>His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,--<br/>  So styled according to the usual forms<br/>Of every monarch, till they are consigned<br/>  To those sad hungry Jacobins the worms,<br/>Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,--<br/>  His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,<br/>Expecting all the welcome of a lover<br/>(A "Highland welcome" all the wide world over).<br/><br/>Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er<br/>  Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,<br/>May look like what it is--neither here nor there,<br/>  They are put on as easily as a hat,<br/>Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,<br/>  Trimmed either heads or hearts to decorate,<br/>Which form an ornament, but no more part<br/>Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.<br/><br/>A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind<br/>  Of gentle feminine delight, and shown<br/>More in the eyelids than the eyes, resigned<br/>  Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,<br/>Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)<br/>  Of Love, when seated on his loveliest throne,<br/>A sincere woman's breast,--for over-_warm_<br/>Or over-_cold_ annihilates the charm.<br/><br/>For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;<br/>  If true, 't is no great lease of its own fire;<br/>For no one, save in very early youth,<br/>  Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,<br/>Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,<br/>  And apt to be transferred to the first buyer<br/>At a sad discount: while your over chilly<br/>Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.<br/><br/>That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,<br/>  For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,<br/>Who fain would have a mutual flame confessed,<br/>  And see a sentimental passion glow,<br/>Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,<br/>  In his monastic concubine of snow;--<br/>In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is<br/>Horatian, "_Medio tu tutissimus ibis_"<br/><br/>The "tu" 's _too_ much,--but let it stand,--the verse<br/>  Requires it, that's to say, the English rhyme,<br/>And not the pink of old hexameters;<br/>  But, after all, there's neither tune nor time<br/>In the last line, which cannot well be worse,<br/>  And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:<br/>I own no prosody can ever rate it<br/>As a rule, but _Truth_ may, if you translate it.<br/><br/>If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,<br/>  I know not--it succeeded, and success<br/>Is much in most things, not less in the heart<br/>  Than other articles of female dress.<br/>Self-love in Man, too, beats all female art;<br/>  They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less:<br/>And no one virtue yet, except starvation,<br/>Could stop that worst of vices--propagation.<br/><br/>We leave this royal couple to repose:<br/>  A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,<br/>Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:<br/>  Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep<br/>As any man's clay mixture undergoes.<br/>  Our least of sorrows are such as we _weep_;<br/>'T is the vile daily drop on drop which wears<br/>The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.<br/><br/>A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill<br/>  To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted<br/>At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,<br/>  A favourite horse fallen lame just as he's mounted,<br/>A bad old woman making a worse will,<br/>  Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted<br/>As certain;--these are paltry things, and yet<br/>I've rarely seen the man they did not fret.<br/><br/>I'm a philosopher; confound them all!<br/>  Bills, beasts, and men, and--no! not womankind!<br/>With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,<br/>  And then my Stoicism leaves nought behind<br/>Which it can either pain or evil call,<br/>  And I can give my whole soul up to mind;<br/>Though what _is_ soul, or mind, their birth or growth,<br/>Is more than I know--the deuce take them both!<br/><br/>So now all things are damned one feels at ease,<br/>  As after reading Athanasius' curse,<br/>Which doth your true believer so much please:<br/>  I doubt if any now could make it worse<br/>O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,<br/>  'T is so sententious, positive, and terse,<br/>And decorates the Book of Common Prayer,<br/>As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.<br/><br/>Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or<br/>  At least one of them!--Oh, the heavy night,<br/>When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,<br/>  Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light<br/>Of the grey morning, and look vainly for<br/>  Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite--<br/>To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake<br/>Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!<br/><br/>These are beneath the canopy of heaven,<br/>  Also beneath the canopy of beds<br/>Four-posted and silk-curtained, which are given<br/>  For rich men and their brides to lay their heads<br/>Upon, in sheets white as what bards call "driven<br/>  Snow," Well! 't is all hap-hazard when one weds.<br/>Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been<br/>Perhaps as wretched if a _peasants quean_.<br/><br/>Don Juan in his feminine disguise,<br/>  With all the damsels in their long array,<br/>Had bowed themselves before th' imperial eyes,<br/>  And at the usual signal ta'en their way<br/>Back to their chambers, those long galleries<br/>  In the seraglio, where the ladies lay<br/>Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there<br/>Beating for Love, as the caged bird's for air.<br/><br/>I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse<br/>  The Tyrant's wish, "that Mankind only had<br/>One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:"<br/>  My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,<br/>And much more tender on the whole than fierce;<br/>  It being (not _now_, but only while a lad)<br/>That Womankind had but one rosy mouth,<br/>To kiss them all at once from North to South.<br/><br/>Oh, enviable Briareus! with thy hands<br/>  And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied<br/>In such proportion!--But my Muse withstands<br/>  The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,<br/>Or travelling in Patagonian lands;<br/>  So let us back to Lilliput, and guide<br/>Our hero through the labyrinth of Love<br/>In which we left him several lines above.<br/><br/>He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,<br/>  At the given signal joined to their array;<br/>And though he certainly ran many risks,<br/>  Yet he could not at times keep, by the way,<br/>(Although the consequences of such frisks<br/>  Are worse than the worst damages men pay<br/>In moral England, where the thing's a tax,)<br/>From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.<br/><br/>Still he forgot not his disguise:--along<br/>  The galleries from room to room they walked,<br/>A virgin-like and edifying throng,<br/>  By eunuchs flanked; while at their head there stalked<br/>A dame who kept up discipline among<br/>  The female ranks, so that none stirred or talked,<br/>Without her sanction on their she-parades:<br/>Her title was "the Mother of the Maids."<br/><br/>Whether she was a "Mother," I know not,<br/>  Or whether they were "Maids" who called her Mother;<br/>But this is her Seraglio title, got<br/>  I know not how, but good as any other;<br/>So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:<br/>  Her office was to keep aloof or smother<br/>All bad propensities in fifteen hundred<br/>Young women, and correct them when they blundered.<br/><br/>A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made<br/>  More easy by the absence of all men--<br/>Except his Majesty,--who, with her aid,<br/>  And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then<br/>A slight example, just to cast a shade<br/>  Along the rest, contrived to keep this den<br/>Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,<br/>Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.<br/><br/>And what is that? Devotion, doubtless--how<br/>  Could you ask such a question?--but we will<br/>Continue. As I said, this goodly row<br/>  Of ladies of all countries at the will<br/>Of one good man, with stately march and slow,<br/>  Like water-lilies floating down a rill--<br/>Or rather lake--for _rills_ do _not_ run _slowly_,--<br/>Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.<br/><br/>But when they reached their own apartments, there,<br/>  Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,<br/>Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere<br/>  When freed from bonds (which are of no great use<br/>After all), or like Irish at a fair,<br/>  Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce<br/>Established between them and bondage, they<br/>Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.<br/><br/>Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;<br/>  Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:<br/>Some thought her dress did not so much become her,<br/>  Or wondered at her ears without a ring;<br/>Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,<br/>  Others contended they were but in spring;<br/>Some thought her rather masculine in height,<br/>While others wished that she had been so quite.<br/><br/>But no one doubted on the whole, that she<br/>  Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,<br/>And fresh, and "beautiful exceedingly,"<br/>  Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:<br/>They wondered how Gulbeyaz, too, could be<br/>  So silly as to buy slaves who might share<br/>(If that his Highness wearied of his bride)<br/>Her Throne and Power, and everything beside.<br/><br/>But what was strangest in this virgin crew,<br/>  Although her beauty was enough to vex,<br/>After the first investigating view,<br/>  They all found out as few, or fewer, specks<br/>In the fair form of their companion new,<br/>  Than is the custom of the gentle sex,<br/>When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,<br/>In a new face "the ugliest creature breathing."<br/><br/>And yet they had their little jealousies,<br/>  Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,<br/>Whether there are such things as sympathies<br/>  Without our knowledge or our approbation,<br/>Although they could not see through his disguise,<br/>  All felt a soft kind of concatenation,<br/>Like Magnetism, or Devilism, or what<br/>You please--we will not quarrel about that:<br/><br/>But certain 't is they all felt for their new<br/>  Companion something newer still, as 't were<br/>A sentimental friendship through and through,<br/>  Extremely pure, which made them all concur<br/>In wishing her their sister, save a few<br/>  Who wished they had a brother just like her,<br/>Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,<br/>They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.<br/><br/>Of those who had most genius for this sort<br/>  Of sentimental friendship, there were three,<br/>Lolah, Katinka, and Dud√π--in short<br/>  (To save description), fair as fair can be<br/>Were they, according to the best report,<br/>  Though differing in stature and degree,<br/>And clime and time, and country and complexion--<br/>They all alike admired their new connection.<br/><br/>Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;<br/>  Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,<br/>With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,<br/>  And feet so small they scarce seemed made to tread,<br/>But rather skim the earth; while Dud√π's form<br/>  Looked more adapted to be put to bed,<br/>Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,<br/>Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.<br/><br/>A kind of sleepy Venus seemed Dud√π,<br/>  Yet very fit to "murder sleep" in those<br/>Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,<br/>  Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:<br/>Few angles were there in her form, 't is true,<br/>  Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;<br/>Yet, after all, 't would puzzle to say where<br/>It would not spoil some separate charm to _pare_.<br/><br/>She was not violently lively, but<br/>  Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;<br/>Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,<br/>  They put beholders in a tender taking;<br/>She looked (this simile's quite new) just cut<br/>  From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,<br/>The mortal and the marble still at strife,<br/>And timidly expanding into Life.<br/><br/>Lolah demanded the new damsel's name--<br/>  "Juanna."--Well, a pretty name enough.<br/>Katinka asked her also whence she came--<br/>  "From Spain."--"But where _is_ Spain?"--"Don't ask such stuff,<br/>Nor show your Georgian ignorance--for shame!"<br/>  Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,<br/>To poor Katinka: "Spain's an island near<br/>Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier."<br/><br/>Dud√π said nothing, but sat down beside<br/>  Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;<br/>And, looking at her steadfastly, she sighed,<br/>  As if she pitied her for being there,<br/>A pretty stranger without friend or guide,<br/>  And all abashed, too, at the general stare<br/>Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,<br/>With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.<br/><br/>But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,<br/>  With "Ladies, it is time to go to rest.<br/>I'm puzzled what to do with _you_, my dear!"<br/>  She added to Juanna, their new guest:<br/>"Your coming has been unexpected here,<br/>  And every couch is occupied; you had best<br/>Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early<br/>We will have all things settled for you fairly."<br/><br/>Here Lolah interposed--"Mamma, you know<br/>  You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear<br/>That anybody should disturb you so;<br/>  I'll take Juanna; we're a slenderer pair<br/>Than you would make the half of;--don't say no;<br/>  And I of your young charge will take due care."<br/>But here Katinka interfered, and said,<br/>"She also had compassion and a bed."<br/><br/>"Besides, I hate to sleep alone," quoth she.<br/>  The matron frowned: "Why so?"--"For fear of ghosts,"<br/>Replied Katinka; "I am sure I see<br/>  A phantom upon each of the four posts;<br/>And then I have the worst dreams that can be,<br/>  Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts."<br/>The dame replied, "Between your dreams and you,<br/>I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.<br/><br/>"You, Lolah, must continue still to lie<br/>  Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you<br/>The same, Katinka, until by and by:<br/>  And I shall place Juanna with Dud√π,<br/>Who's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,<br/>  And will not toss and chatter the night through.<br/>What say you, child?"--Dud√π said nothing, as<br/>Her talents were of the more silent class;<br/><br/>But she rose up, and kissed the matron's brow<br/>  Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,<br/>Katinka too; and with a gentle bow<br/>  (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)<br/>She took Juanna by the hand to show<br/>  Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,<br/>The others pouting at the matron's preference<br/>Of Dud√π, though they held their tongues from deference.<br/><br/>It was a spacious chamber (Oda is<br/>  The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall<br/>Were couches, toilets--and much more than this<br/>  I might describe, as I have seen it all,<br/>But it suffices--little was amiss;<br/>  'T was on the whole a nobly furnished hall,<br/>With all things ladies want, save one or two,<br/>And even those were nearer than they knew.<br/><br/>Dud√π, as has been said, was a sweet creature,<br/>  Not very dashing, but extremely winning,<br/>With the most regulated charms of feature,<br/>  Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning<br/>Against proportion--the wild strokes of nature<br/>  Which they hit off at once in the beginning,<br/>Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,<br/>And pleasing, or unpleasing, still are like.<br/><br/>But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,<br/>  Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,<br/>Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,<br/>  Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it<br/>Than are your mighty passions and so forth,<br/>  Which, some call "the Sublime:" I wish they'd try it:<br/>I've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,<br/>And pity lovers rather more than seamen.<br/><br/>But she was pensive more than melancholy,<br/>  And serious more than pensive, and serene,<br/>It may be, more than either--not unholy<br/>  Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.<br/>The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly<br/>  Unconscious, albeit turned of quick seventeen,<br/>That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;<br/>She never thought about herself at all.<br/><br/>And therefore was she kind and gentle as<br/>  The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,<br/>By which its nomenclature came to pass;<br/>  Thus most appropriately has been shown<br/>"Lucus √† _non_ lucendo," _not_ what _was_,<br/>  But what _was not_; a sort of style that's grown<br/>Extremely common in this age, whose metal<br/>The Devil may decompose, but never settle:<br/><br/>I think it may be of "Corinthian Brass,"<br/>  Which was a mixture of all metals, but<br/>The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass<br/>  This long parenthesis: I could not shut<br/>It sooner for the soul of me, and class<br/>  My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put<br/>A kind construction upon them and me:<br/>But _that_ you won't--then don't--I am not less free.<br/><br/>'T is time we should return to plain narration,<br/>  And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dud√π,<br/>With every kindness short of ostentation,<br/>  Showed Juan, or Juanna, through and through<br/>This labyrinth of females, and each station<br/>  Described--what's strange--in words extremely few:<br/>I have but one simile, and that's a blunder,<br/>For wordless woman, which is _silent_ thunder.<br/><br/>And next she gave her (I say _her_, because<br/>  The gender still was epicene, at least<br/>In outward show, which is a saving clause)<br/>  An outline of the customs of the East,<br/>With all their chaste integrity of laws,<br/>  By which the more a Harem is increased,<br/>The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties<br/>Of any supernumerary beauties.<br/><br/>And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:<br/>  Dud√∫ was fond of kissing--which I'm sure<br/>That nobody can ever take amiss,<br/>  Because 't is pleasant, so that it be pure,<br/>And between females means no more than this--<br/>  That they have nothing better near, or newer.<br/>"Kiss" rhymes to "bliss" in fact as well as verse--<br/>I wish it never led to something worse.<br/><br/>In perfect innocence she then unmade<br/>  Her toilet, which cost little, for she was<br/>A child of Nature, carelessly arrayed:<br/>  If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,<br/>'T was like the fawn, which, in the lake displayed,<br/>  Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,<br/>When first she starts, and then returns to peep,<br/>Admiring this new native of the deep.<br/><br/>And one by one her articles of dress<br/>  Were laid aside; but not before she offered<br/>Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess<br/>  Of modesty declined the assistance proffered:<br/>Which passed well off--as she could do no less;<br/>  Though by this _politesse_ she rather suffered,<br/>Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,<br/>Which surely were invented for our sins,--<br/><br/>Making a woman like a porcupine,<br/>  Not to be rashly touched. But still more dread,<br/>Oh ye! whose fate it is, as once 't was mine,<br/>  In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--<br/>I did my very boyish best to shine<br/>  In tricking her out for a masquerade:<br/>The pins were placed sufficiently, but not<br/>Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.<br/><br/>But these are foolish things to all the wise,<br/>  And I love Wisdom more than she loves me;<br/>My tendency is to philosophise<br/>  On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;<br/>But still the spouseless virgin _Knowledge_ flies.<br/>  What are we? and whence came we? what shall be<br/>Our _ultimate_ existence? what's our present?<br/>Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.<br/><br/>There was deep silence in the chamber: dim<br/>  And distant from each other burned the lights,<br/>And slumber hovered o'er each lovely limb<br/>  Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,<br/>They should have walked there in their sprightliest trim,<br/>  By way of change from their sepulchral sites,<br/>And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste<br/>Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.<br/><br/>Many and beautiful lay those around,<br/>  Like flowers of different hue, and clime, and root,<br/>In some exotic garden sometimes found,<br/>  With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.<br/>One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,<br/>  And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit<br/>Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,<br/>And lips apart, which showed the pearls beneath.<br/><br/>One with her flushed cheek laid on her white arm,<br/>  And raven ringlets gathered in dark crowd<br/>Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;<br/>  And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud<br/>The moon breaks, half unveiled each further charm,<br/>  As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,<br/>Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night<br/>All bashfully to struggle into light.<br/><br/>This is no bull, although it sounds so; for<br/>  'T was night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.<br/>A third's all pallid aspect offered more<br/>  The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betrayed<br/>Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore<br/>  Belov√©d and deplored; while slowly strayed<br/>(As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges<br/>The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.<br/><br/>A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,<br/>  Lay in a breathless, hushed, and stony sleep;<br/>White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,<br/>  Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,<br/>Or Lot's wife done in salt,--or what you will;--<br/>  My similes are gathered in a heap,<br/>So pick and choose--perhaps you'll be content<br/>With a carved lady on a monument.<br/><br/>And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?<br/>  A lady of a "certain age," which means<br/>Certainly ag√©d--what her years might be<br/>  I know not, never counting past their teens;<br/>But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,<br/>  As ere that awful period intervenes<br/>Which lays both men and women on the shelf,<br/>To meditate upon their sins and self.<br/><br/>But all this time how slept, or dreamed, Dud√∫?<br/>  With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,<br/>And scorn to add a syllable untrue;<br/>  But ere the middle watch was hardly over,<br/>Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,<br/>  And phantoms hovered, or might seem to hover,<br/>To those who like their company, about<br/>The apartment, on a sudden she screamed out:<br/><br/>And that so loudly, that upstarted all<br/>  The Oda, in a general commotion:<br/>Matron and maids, and those whom you may call<br/>  Neither, came crowding like the waves of Ocean,<br/>One on the other, throughout the whole hall,<br/>  All trembling, wondering, without the least notion<br/>More than I have myself of what could make<br/>The calm Dud√π so turbulently wake.<br/><br/>But wide awake she was, and round her bed.<br/>  With floating draperies and with flying hair,<br/>With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,<br/>  And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,<br/>And bright as any meteor ever bred<br/>  By the North Pole,--they sought her cause of care,<br/>For she seemed agitated, flushed, and frightened,<br/>Her eye dilated, and her colour heightened.<br/><br/>But what is strange--and a strong proof how great<br/>  A blessing is sound sleep--Juanna lay<br/>As fast as ever husband by his mate<br/>  In holy matrimony snores away.<br/>Not all the clamour broke her happy state<br/>  Of slumber, ere they shook her,--so they say<br/>At least,--and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,<br/>And yawned a good deal with discreet surprise.<br/><br/>And now commenced a strict investigation,<br/>  Which, as all spoke at once, and more than once<br/>Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,<br/>  Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce<br/>To answer in a very clear oration.<br/>  Dud√∫ had never passed for wanting sense,<br/>But being "no orator as Brutus is,"<br/>Could not at first expound what was amiss.<br/><br/>At length she said, that in a slumber sound<br/>  She dreamed a dream, of walking in a wood--<br/>A "wood obscure," like that where Dante found<br/>  Himself in at the age when all grow good;<br/>Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crowned<br/>  Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;<br/>And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,<br/>And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;<br/><br/>And in the midst a golden apple grew,--<br/>  A most prodigious pippin--but it hung<br/>Rather too high and distant; that she threw<br/>  Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung<br/>Stones and whatever she could pick up, to<br/>  Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung<br/>To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,<br/>But always at a most provoking height;<br/><br/>That on a sudden, when she least had hope,<br/>  It fell down of its own accord before<br/>Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop<br/>  And pick it up, and bite it to the core;<br/>That just as her young lip began to ope<br/>  Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,<br/>A bee flew out, and stung her to the heart,<br/>And so--she woke with a great scream and start.<br/><br/>All this she told with some confusion and<br/>  Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams<br/>Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand<br/>  To expound their vain and visionary gleams.<br/>I've known some odd ones which seemed really planned<br/>  Prophetically, or that which one deems<br/>A "strange coincidence," to use a phrase<br/>By which such things are settled now-a-days.<br/><br/>The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,<br/>  Began, as is the consequence of fear,<br/>To scold a little at the false alarm<br/>  That broke for nothing on their sleeping ear.<br/>The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm<br/>  Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,<br/>And chafed at poor Dud√π, who only sighed,<br/>And said, that she was sorry she had cried.<br/><br/>"I've heard of stories of a cock and bull;<br/>  But visions of an apple and a bee,<br/>To take us from our natural rest, and pull<br/>  The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,<br/>Would make us think the moon is at its full.<br/>  You surely are unwell, child! we must see,<br/>To-morrow, what his Highness's physician<br/>Will say to this hysteric of a vision.<br/><br/>"And poor Juanna, too, the child's first night<br/>  Within these walls, to be broke in upon<br/>With such a clamour--I had thought it right<br/>  That the young stranger should not lie alone,<br/>And, as the quietest of all, she might<br/>  With you, Dud√π, a good night's rest have known:<br/>But now I must transfer her to the charge<br/>Of Lolah--though her couch is not so large."<br/><br/>Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;<br/>  But poor Dud√π, with large drops in her own,<br/>Resulting from the scolding or the vision,<br/>  Implored that present pardon might be shown<br/>For this first fault, and that on no condition<br/>  (She added in a soft and piteous tone)<br/>Juanna should be taken from her, and<br/>Her future dreams should be all kept in hand.<br/><br/>She promised never more to have a dream,<br/>  At least to dream so loudly as just now;<br/>She wondered at herself how she could scream--<br/>  'T was foolish, nervous, as she must allow,<br/>A fond hallucination, and a theme<br/>  For laughter--but she felt her spirits low,<br/>And begged they would excuse her; she'd get over<br/>This weakness in a few hours, and recover.<br/><br/>And here Juanna kindly interposed,<br/>  And said she felt herself extremely well<br/>Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed,<br/>  When all around rang like a tocsin bell;<br/>She did not find herself the least disposed<br/>  To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell<br/>Apart from one who had no sin to show,<br/>Save that of dreaming once "mal-√†-propos."<br/><br/>As thus Juanna spoke, Dud√π turned round<br/>  And hid her face within Juanna's breast:<br/>Her neck alone was seen, but that was found<br/>  The colour of a budding rose's crest.<br/>I can't tell why she blushed, nor can expound<br/>  The mystery of this rupture of their test;<br/>All that I know is, that the facts I state<br/>Are true as Truth has ever been of late,<br/><br/>And so good night to them,--or, if you will,<br/>  Good morrow--for the cock had crown, and light<br/>Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,<br/>  And the mosque crescent struggled into sight<br/>Of the long caravan, which in the chill<br/>  Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height<br/>That stretches to the stony belt, which girds<br/>Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.<br/><br/>With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,<br/>  Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale<br/>As Passion rises, with its bosom worn,<br/>  Arrayed herself with mantle, gem, and veil.<br/>The Nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,<br/>  Which fable places in her breast of wail,<br/>Is lighter far of heart and voice than those<br/>Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.<br/><br/>And that's the moral of this composition,<br/>  If people would but see its real drift;--<br/>But _that_ they will not do without suspicion,<br/>  Because all gentle readers have the gift<br/>Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision:<br/>  While gentle writers also love to lift<br/>Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,<br/>The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.<br/><br/>Rose the Sultana from a bed of splendour,<br/>  Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried<br/>Aloud because his feelings were too tender<br/>  To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,--<br/>So beautiful that Art could little mend her,<br/>  Though pale with conflicts between Love and Pride;--<br/>So agitated was she with her error,<br/>She did not even look into the mirror.<br/><br/>Also arose about the self-same time,<br/>  Perhaps a little later, her great Lord,<br/>Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,<br/>  And of a wife by whom he was abhorred;<br/>A thing of much less import in that clime--<br/>  At least to those of incomes which afford<br/>The filling up their whole connubial cargo--<br/>Than where two wives are under an embargo.<br/><br/>He did not think much on the matter, nor<br/>  Indeed on any other: as a man<br/>He liked to have a handsome paramour<br/>  At hand, as one may like to have a fan,<br/>And therefore of Circassians had good store,<br/>  As an amusement after the Divan;<br/>Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,<br/>Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.<br/><br/>And now he rose; and after due ablutions<br/>  Exacted by the customs of the East,<br/>And prayers and other pious evolutions,<br/>  He drank six cups of coffee at the least,<br/>And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,<br/>  Whose victories had recently increased<br/>In Catherine's reign, whom Glory still adores,<br/>As greatest of all sovereigns and w----s.<br/><br/>But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!<br/>  Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend<br/>Thine ear, if it should reach--and now rhymes wander<br/>  Almost as far as Petersburgh, and lend<br/>A dreadful impulse to each loud meander<br/>  Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend<br/>Their roar even with the Baltic's--so you be<br/>Your father's son, 't is quite enough for me.<br/><br/>To call men love-begotten, or proclaim<br/>  Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,<br/>That hater of Mankind, would be a shame,<br/>  A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:<br/>But people's ancestors are History's game;<br/>  And if one Lady's slip could leave a crime on<br/>All generations, I should like to know<br/>What pedigree the best would have to show?<br/><br/>Had Catherine and the Sultan understood<br/>  Their own true interests, which Kings rarely know,<br/>Until 't is taught by lessons rather rude,<br/>  There was a way to end their strife, although<br/>Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,<br/>  Without the aid of Prince or Plenipo:<br/>She to dismiss her guards and he his Harem,<br/>And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.<br/><br/>But as it was, his Highness had to hold<br/>  His daily council upon ways and means<br/>How to encounter with this martial scold,<br/>  This modern Amazon and Queen of queans;<br/>And the perplexity could not be told<br/>  Of all the pillars of the State, which leans<br/>Sometimes a little heavy on the backs<br/>Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.<br/><br/>Meantime Gulbeyaz when her King was gone,<br/>  Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place<br/>For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,<br/>  And rich with all contrivances which grace<br/>Those gay recesses:--many a precious stone<br/>  Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase<br/>Of porcelain held in the fettered flowers,<br/>Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.<br/><br/>Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,<br/>  Vied with each other on this costly spot;<br/>And singing birds without were heard to warble;<br/>  And the stained glass which lighted this fair grot<br/>Varied each ray;--but all descriptions garble<br/>  The true effect, and so we had better not<br/>Be too minute; an outline is the best,--<br/>A lively reader's fancy does the rest.<br/><br/>And here she summoned Baba, and required<br/>  Don Juan at his hands, and information<br/>Of what had passed since all the slaves retired,<br/>  And whether he had occupied their station:<br/>If matters had been managed as desired,<br/>  And his disguise with due consideration<br/>Kept up; and above all, the where and how<br/>He had passed the night, was what she wished to know.<br/><br/>Baba, with some embarrassment, replied<br/>  To this long catechism of questions, asked<br/>More easily than answered,--that he had tried<br/>  His best to obey in what he had been tasked;<br/>But there seemed something that he wished to hide,<br/>  Which Hesitation more betrayed than masked;<br/>He scratched his ear, the infallible resource<br/>To which embarrassed people have recourse.<br/><br/>Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,<br/>  Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;<br/>She liked quick answers in all conversations;<br/>  And when she saw him stumbling like a steed<br/>In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;<br/>  And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,<br/>Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,<br/>And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.<br/><br/>When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew<br/>  To bode him no great good, he deprecated<br/>Her anger, and beseeched she'd hear him through--<br/>  He could not help the thing which he related:<br/>Then out it came at length, that to Dud√π<br/>  Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;<br/>But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on<br/>The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.<br/><br/>The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom<br/>  The discipline of the whole Harem bore,<br/>As soon as they re-entered their own room,<br/>  For Baba's function stopped short at the door,<br/>Had settled all; nor could he then presume<br/>  (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,<br/>Without exciting such suspicion as<br/>Might make the matter still worse than it was.<br/><br/>He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure,<br/>  Juan had not betrayed himself; in fact<br/>'T was certain that his conduct had been pure,<br/>  Because a foolish or imprudent act<br/>Would not alone have made him insecure,<br/>  But ended in his being found out and _sacked,_<br/>And thrown into the sea.--Thus Baba spoke<br/>Of all save Dud√π's dream, which was no joke.<br/><br/>This he discreetly kept in the back ground,<br/>  And talked away--and might have talked till now,<br/>For any further answer that he found,<br/>  So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:<br/>Her cheek turned ashes, ears rung, brain whirled round,<br/>  As if she had received a sudden blow,<br/>And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly<br/>O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.<br/><br/>Although she was not of the fainting sort,<br/>  Baba thought she would faint, but there he erred--<br/>It was but a convulsion, which though short<br/>  Can never be described; we all have heard,<br/>And some of us have felt thus "_all amort_"<br/>  When things beyond the common have occurred;--<br/>Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony<br/>What she could ne'er express--then how should I?<br/><br/>She stood a moment as a Pythoness<br/>  Stands on her tripod, agonized, and full<br/>Of inspiration gathered from distress,<br/>  When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull<br/>The heart asunder;--then, as more or less<br/>  Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,<br/>She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,<br/>And bowed her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.<br/><br/>Her face declined and was unseen; her hair<br/>  Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,<br/>Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,<br/>  Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,<br/>A low, soft ottoman), and black Despair<br/>  Stirred up and down her bosom like a billow,<br/>Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check<br/>Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.<br/><br/>Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping<br/>  Concealed her features better than a veil;<br/>And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,<br/>  White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:<br/>Would that I were a painter! to be grouping<br/>  All that a poet drags into detail!<br/>Oh that my words were colours! but their tints<br/>May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.<br/><br/>Baba, who knew by experience when to talk<br/>  And when to hold his tongue, now held it till<br/>This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk<br/>  Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.<br/>At length she rose up, and began to walk<br/>  Slowly along the room, but silent still,<br/>And her brow cleared, but not her troubled eye;<br/>The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.<br/><br/>She stopped, and raised her head to speak-but paused<br/>  And then moved on again with rapid pace;<br/>Then slackened it, which is the march most caused<br/>  By deep emotion:--you may sometimes trace<br/>A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed<br/>  By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased<br/>By all the demons of all passions, showed<br/>Their work even by the way in which he trode.<br/><br/>Gulbeyaz stopped and beckoned Baba:--"Slave!<br/>  Bring the two slaves!" she said in a low tone,<br/>But one which Baba did not like to brave,<br/>  And yet he shuddered, and seemed rather prone<br/>To prove reluctant, and begged leave to crave<br/>  (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown<br/>What slaves her Highness wished to indicate,<br/>For fear of any error, like the late.<br/><br/>"The Georgian and her paramour," replied<br/>  The Imperial Bride--and added, "Let the boat<br/>Be ready by the secret portal's side:<br/>  You know the rest." The words stuck in her throat,<br/>Despite her injured love and fiery pride;<br/>  And of this Baba willingly took note,<br/>And begged by every hair of Mahomet's beard,<br/>She would revoke the order he had heard.<br/><br/>"To hear is to obey," he said; "but still,<br/>  Sultana, think upon the consequence:<br/>It is not that I shall not all fulfil<br/>  Your orders, even in their severest sense;<br/>But such precipitation may end ill,<br/>  Even at your own imperative expense:<br/>I do not mean destruction and exposure,<br/>In case of any premature disclosure;<br/><br/>"But your own feelings. Even should all the rest<br/>  Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide<br/>Already many a once love-beaten breast<br/>  Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide--<br/>You love this boyish, new, Seraglio guest,<br/>  And if this violent remedy be tried--<br/>Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,<br/>That killing him is not the way to cure you."<br/><br/>"What dost thou know of Love or feeling?--Wretch!<br/>  Begone!" she cried, with kindling eyes--"and do<br/>My bidding!" Baba vanished, for to stretch<br/>  His own remonstrance further he well knew<br/>Might end in acting as his own "Jack Ketch;"<br/>  And though he wished extremely to get through<br/>This awkward business without harm to others,<br/>He still preferred his own neck to another's.<br/><br/>Away he went then upon his commission,<br/>  Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase<br/>Against all women of whate'er condition,<br/>  Especially Sultanas and their ways;<br/>Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,<br/>  Their never knowing their own mind two days,<br/>The trouble that they gave, their immorality,<br/>Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.<br/><br/>And then he called his brethren to his aid,<br/>  And sent one on a summons to the pair,<br/>That they must instantly be well arrayed,<br/>  And above all be combed even to a hair,<br/>And brought before the Empress, who had made<br/>  Inquiries after them with kindest care:<br/>At which Dud√π looked strange, and Juan silly;<br/>But go they must at once, and will I--nill I.<br/><br/>And here I leave them at their preparation<br/>  For the imperial presence, wherein whether<br/>Gulbeyaz showed them both commiseration,<br/>  Or got rid of the parties altogether,<br/>Like other angry ladies of her nation,--<br/>  Are things the turning of a hair or feather<br/>May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate<br/>In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.<br/><br/>I leave them for the present with good wishes,<br/>  Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange<br/>Another part of History; for the dishes<br/>  Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;<br/>And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,<br/>  (Although his situation now seems strange,<br/>And scarce secure),--as such digressions _are_ fair,<br/>The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.<br/><br/>CANTO THE SEVENTH.<br/><br/>O LOVE!

but Fame (capricious strumpet),<br/>It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,<br/><br/>And cannot tune those discords of narration,<br/>  Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;<br/>Yet there were several worth commemoration,<br/>  As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;<br/>Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration<br/>  Of Londonderry drawling against time,<br/>Ending in "ischskin," "ousckin," "iffskchy," "ouski,"<br/>Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,<br/><br/>Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,<br/>  Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,<br/>All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoffed high<br/>  Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:<br/>Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,<br/>  Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin<br/>Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,<br/>And no more handy substitute been near.<br/><br/>Then there were foreigners of much renown,<br/>  Of various nations, and all volunteers;<br/>Not fighting for their country or its crown,<br/>  But wishing to be one day brigadiers;<br/>Also to have the sacking of a town;--<br/>  A pleasant thing to young men at their years.<br/>'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,<br/>Sixteen called Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.<br/><br/>Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson;--all the rest<br/>  Had been called _"Jemmy,"_ after the great bard;<br/>I don't know whether they had arms or crest,<br/>  But such a godfather's as good a card.<br/>Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best<br/>  Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,<br/>Was _he_, since so renowned "in country quarters<br/>At Halifax;" but now he served the Tartars.<br/><br/>The rest were Jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills,<br/>  But when I've added that the elder Jack Smith<br/>Was born in Cumberland among the hills,<br/>  And that his father was an honest blacksmith,<br/>I've said all _I_ know of a name that fills<br/>  Three lines of the despatch in taking "Schmacksmith,"<br/>A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein<br/>He fell, immortal in a bulletin.<br/><br/>I wonder (although Mars no doubt's a god I<br/>  Praise) if a man's name in a _bulletin_<br/>May make up for a _bullet in_ his body?<br/>  I hope this little question is no sin,<br/>Because, though I am but a simple noddy,<br/>  I think one Shakespeare puts the same thought in<br/>The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,<br/>Which many people pass for wits by quoting.<br/><br/>Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay;<br/>  But I'm too great a patriot to record<br/>Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;<br/>  I'd rather tell ten lies than say a word<br/>Of truth;--such truths are treason; they betray<br/>  Their country; and as traitors are abhorred,<br/>Who name the French in English, save to show<br/>How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.<br/><br/>The Russians, having built two batteries on<br/>  An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;<br/>The first was to bombard it, and knock down<br/>  The public buildings and the private too,<br/>No matter what poor souls might be undone:<br/>  The city's shape suggested this, 't is true,<br/>Formed like an amphitheatre--each dwelling<br/>Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.<br/><br/>The second object was to profit by<br/>  The moment of the general consternation,<br/>To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh<br/>  Extremely tranquil, anchored at its station:<br/>But a third motive was as probably<br/>  To frighten them into capitulation;<br/>A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,<br/>Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.<br/><br/>A habit rather blameable, which is<br/>  That of despising those we combat with,<br/>Common in many cases, was in this<br/>  The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith--<br/>One of the valorous "Smiths" whom we shall miss<br/>  Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to "pith;"<br/>But 't is a name so spread o'er "Sir" and "Madam,"<br/>That one would think the _first_ who bore it _"Adam."_<br/><br/>The Russian batteries were incomplete,<br/>  Because they were constructed in a hurry;<br/>Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,<br/>  And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,<br/>When the sale of new books is not so fleet<br/>  As they who print them think is necessary,<br/>May likewise put off for a time what story<br/>Sometimes calls "Murder," and at others "Glory."<br/><br/>Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,<br/>  Their haste or waste, I neither know nor care,<br/>Or some contractor's personal cupidity,<br/>  Saving his soul by cheating in the ware<br/>Of homicide, but there was no solidity<br/>  In the new batteries erected there;<br/>They either missed, or they were never missed,<br/>And added greatly to the missing list.<br/><br/>A sad miscalculation about distance<br/>  Made all their naval matters incorrect;<br/>Three fireships lost their amiable existence<br/>  Before they reached a spot to take effect;<br/>The match was lit too soon, and no assistance<br/>  Could remedy this lubberly defect;<br/>They blew up in the middle of the river,<br/>While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.<br/><br/>At seven they rose, however, and surveyed<br/>  The Russ flotilla getting under way;<br/>'T was nine, when still advancing undismayed,<br/>  Within a cable's length their vessels lay<br/>Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,<br/>  Which was returned with interest, I may say,<br/>And by a fire of musketry and grape,<br/>And shells and shot of every size and shape.<br/><br/>For six hours bore they without intermission<br/>  The Turkish fire, and, aided by their own<br/>Land batteries, worked their guns with great precision;<br/>  At length they found mere cannonade alone<br/>By no means would produce the town's submission,<br/>  And made a signal to retreat at one.<br/>One bark blew up, a second near the works<br/>Running aground, was taken by the Turks.<br/><br/>The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;<br/>  But when they saw the enemy retire,<br/>Their Delhis manned some boats, and sailed again,<br/>  And galled the Russians with a heavy fire,<br/>And tried to make a landing on the main;<br/>  But here the effect fell short of their desire:<br/>Count Damas drove them back into the water<br/>Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.<br/><br/>"If" (says the historian here) "I could report<br/>  All that the Russians did upon this day,<br/>I think that several volumes would fall short,<br/>  And I should still have many things to say;"<br/>And so he says no more--but pays his court<br/>  To some distinguished strangers in that fray;<br/>The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,<br/>Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.<br/><br/>This being the case, may show us what Fame _is_:<br/>  For out of these three "_preux Chevaliers_," how<br/>Many of common readers give a guess<br/>  That such existed? (and they may live now<br/>For aught we know.) Renown's all hit or miss;<br/>  There's fortune even in Fame, we must allow.<br/>'T is true, the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne<br/>Have half withdrawn from _him_ Oblivion's screen.<br/><br/>But here are men who fought in gallant actions<br/>  As gallantly as ever heroes fought,<br/>But buried in the heap of such transactions<br/>  Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.<br/>Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,<br/>  And is extinguished sooner than she ought:<br/>Of all our modern battles, I will bet<br/>You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.<br/><br/>In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,<br/>  Showed that _somewhere, somehow_, there was a fault,<br/>And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)<br/>  Most strongly recommended an assault;<br/>In which he was opposed by young and hoary,<br/>  Which made a long debate; but I must halt,<br/>For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,<br/>I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.<br/><br/>There was a man, if that he was a man,<br/>  Not that his manhood could be called in question,<br/>For had he not been Hercules, his span<br/>  Had been as short in youth as indigestion<br/>Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,<br/>  He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on<br/>The soil of the green province he had wasted,<br/>As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.<br/><br/>This was Potemkin--a great thing in days<br/>  When homicide and harlotry made great;<br/>If stars and titles could entail long praise,<br/>  His glory might half equal his estate.<br/>This fellow, being six foot high, could raise<br/>  A kind of phantasy proportionate<br/>In the then Sovereign of the Russian people,<br/>Who measured men as you would do a steeple.<br/><br/>While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent<br/>  A courier to the Prince, and he succeeded<br/>In ordering matters after his own bent;<br/>  I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,<br/>But shortly he had cause to be content.<br/>  In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,<br/>And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border<br/>Were briskly fired and answered in due order.<br/><br/>But on the thirteenth, when already part<br/>  Of the troops were embarked, the siege to raise,<br/>A courier on the spur inspired new heart<br/>  Into all panters for newspaper praise,<br/>As well as dilettanti in War's art,<br/>  By his despatches (couched in pithy phrase)<br/>Announcing the appointment of that lover of<br/>Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.<br/><br/>The letter of the Prince to the same Marshal<br/>  Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause<br/>Been one to which a good heart could be partial--<br/>  Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;<br/>But as it was mere lust of Power to o'er-arch all<br/>  With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,<br/>Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,<br/>"You will take Ismail at whatever price."<br/><br/>"Let there be Light! said God, and there was Light!"<br/>  "Let there be Blood!" says man, and there's a sea!<br/>The fiat of this spoiled child of the Night<br/>  (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree<br/>More evil in an hour, than thirty bright<br/>  Summers could renovate, though they should be<br/>Lovely as those which ripened Eden's fruit;<br/>For War cuts up not only branch, but root.<br/><br/>Our friends, the Turks, who with loud "Allahs" now<br/>  Began to signalise the Russ retreat,<br/>Were damnably mistaken; few are slow<br/>  In thinking that their enemy is beat,<br/>(Or _beaten_, if you insist on grammar, though<br/>  I never think about it in a heat,)<br/>But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,<br/>Who hating hogs, yet wished to save their bacon.<br/><br/>For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew<br/>  In sight two horsemen, who were deemed Cossacques<br/>For some time, till they came in nearer view:<br/>  They had but little baggage at their backs,<br/>For there were but _three_ shirts between the two;<br/>  But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,<br/>Till, in approaching, were at length descried<br/>In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.<br/><br/>"Great joy to London now!" says some great fool,<br/>  When London had a grand illumination,<br/>Which to that bottle-conjuror, John Bull,<br/>  Is of all dreams the first hallucination;<br/>So that the streets of coloured lamps are full,<br/>  That sage (said John) surrenders at discretion<br/>His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,<br/>To gratify, like a huge moth, this _one_ sense.<br/><br/>'T is strange that he should further "Damn his eyes,"<br/>  For they are damned; that once all-famous oath<br/>Is to the Devil now no further prize,<br/>  Since John has lately lost the use of both.<br/>Debt he calls Wealth, and taxes Paradise;<br/>  And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,<br/>Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,<br/>Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.<br/><br/>But to the tale;--great joy unto the camp!<br/>  To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,<br/>O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,<br/>  Presaging a most luminous attack;<br/>Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,<br/>  Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,<br/>He flitted to and fro a dancing light,<br/>Which all who saw it followed, wrong or right.<br/><br/>But, certes, matters took a different face;<br/>  There was enthusiasm and much applause,<br/>The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,<br/>  And all presaged good fortune to their cause.<br/>Within a cannot-shot length of the place<br/>  They drew, constructed ladders, repaired flaws<br/>In former works, made new, prepared fascines,<br/>And all kinds of benevolent machines.<br/><br/>'T is thus the spirit of a single mind<br/>  Makes that of multitudes take one direction,<br/>As roll the waters to the breathing wind,<br/>  Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;<br/>Or as a little dog will lead the blind,<br/>  Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection<br/>By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;<br/>Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.<br/><br/>The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought<br/>  That they were going to a marriage feast<br/>(This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,<br/>  Since there is discord after both at least):<br/>There was not now a luggage boy but sought<br/>  Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;<br/>And why? because a little--odd--old man,<br/>Stripped to his shirt, was come to lead the van.<br/><br/>But so it was; and every preparation<br/>  Was made with all alacrity: the first<br/>Detachment of three columns took its station,<br/>  And waited but the signal's voice to burst<br/>Upon the foe: the second's ordination<br/>  Was also in three columns, with a thirst<br/>For Glory gaping o'er a sea of Slaughter:<br/>The third, in columns two, attacked by water.<br/><br/>New batteries were erected, and was held<br/>  A general council, in which Unanimity,<br/>That stranger to most councils, here prevailed,<br/>  As sometimes happens in a great extremity;<br/>And every difficulty being dispelled,<br/>  Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,<br/>While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,<br/>Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet.<br/><br/>It is an actual fact, that he, commander<br/>  In chief, in proper person deigned to drill<br/>The awkward squad, and could afford to squander<br/>  His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil;<br/>Just as you'd break a sucking salamander<br/>  To swallow flame, and never take it ill:<br/>He showed them how to mount a ladder (which<br/>Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.<br/><br/>Also he dressed up, for the nonce, fascines<br/>  Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,<br/>And made them charge with bayonet these machines,<br/>  By way of lesson against actual Turks;<br/>And when well practised in these mimic scenes,<br/>  He judged them proper to assail the works,--<br/>(At which your wise men sneered in phrases witty),<br/>He made no answer--but he took the city.<br/><br/>Most things were in this posture on the eve<br/>  Of the assault, and all the camp was in<br/>A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;<br/>  Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin<br/>Are very silent when they once believe<br/>  That all is settled:--there was little din,<br/>For some were thinking of their home and friends,<br/>And others of themselves and latter ends.<br/><br/>Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,<br/>  Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;<br/>For the man was, we safely may assert,<br/>  A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;<br/>Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,<br/>  Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering--Now<br/>Mars, now Momus--and when bent to storm<br/>A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.<br/><br/>The day before the assault, while upon drill--<br/>  For this great conqueror played the corporal--<br/>Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,<br/>  Had met a party towards the Twilight's fall,<br/>One of whom spoke their tongue--or well or ill,<br/>  'T was much that he was understood at all;<br/>But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,<br/>They found that he had fought beneath their banner.<br/><br/>Whereon immediately at his request<br/>  They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;<br/>Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guessed<br/>  That these were merely masquerading Tartars,<br/>And that beneath each Turkish-fashioned vest<br/>  Lurked Christianity--which sometimes barters<br/>Her inward grace for outward show, and makes<br/>It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.<br/><br/>Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt<br/>  Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,<br/>Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,<br/>  And lecturing on the noble art of killing,--<br/>For deeming human clay but common dirt<br/>  This great philosopher was thus instilling<br/>His maxims, which to martial comprehension<br/>Proved death in battle equal to a pension;--<br/><br/>Suwarrow, when he saw this company<br/>  Of Cossacques and their prey, turned round and cast<br/>Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:--<br/>  "Whence come ye?"--"From Constantinople last,<br/>Captives just now escaped," was the reply.<br/>  "What are ye?"--"What you see us." Briefly passed<br/>This dialogue; for he who answered knew<br/>To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.<br/><br/>"Your names?"--"Mine's Johnson, and my comrade's Juan;<br/>  The other two are women, and the third<br/>Is neither man nor woman." The Chief threw on<br/>  The party a slight glance, then said," I have heard<br/>_Your_ name before, the second is a new one:<br/>  To bring the other three here was absurd:<br/>But let that pass:--I think I have heard your name<br/>In the Nikolaiew regiment?"--"The same."<br/><br/>"You served at Widdin?"--"Yes."--"You led the attack?"<br/>  "I did."--"What next?"--"I really hardly know"--<br/>"You were the first i' the breach?"--"I was not slack<br/>  At least to follow those who might be so"--"What<br/>followed?"--"A shot laid me on my back,<br/>  And I became a prisoner to the foe"--<br/>"You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded<br/>Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.<br/><br/>"Where will you serve?"--"Where'er you please."--"I know<br/>  You like to be the hope of the forlorn,<br/>And doubtless would be foremost on the foe<br/>  After the hardships you've already borne.<br/>And this young fellow--say what can he do?<br/>  He with the beardless chin and garments torn?"--<br/>"Why, General, if he hath no greater fault<br/>In War than Love, he had better lead the assault"--<br/><br/>"He shall if that he dare." Here Juan bowed<br/>  Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow<br/>Continued: "Your old regiment's allowed,<br/>  By special providence, to lead to-morrow,<br/>Or, it may be, to-night, the assault: I have vowed<br/>  To several Saints, that shortly plough or harrow<br/>Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk<br/>Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.<br/><br/>"So now, my lads, for Glory!"--Here he turned<br/>  And drilled away in the most classic Russian,<br/>Until each high heroic bosom burned<br/>  For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion<br/>A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurned<br/>  All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on<br/>To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering<br/>The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.<br/><br/>Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy<br/>  Himself a favourite, ventured to address<br/>Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high<br/>  In his resumed amusement. "I confess<br/>My debt in being thus allowed to die<br/>  Among the foremost; but if you'd express<br/>Explicitly our several posts, my friend<br/>And self would know what duty to attend."<br/><br/>"Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you<br/>  Will join your former regiment, which should be<br/>Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to"--<br/>  (Here he called up a Polish orderly)<br/>"His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:<br/>  The stranger stripling may remain with me;<br/>He's a fine boy. The women may be sent<br/>To the other baggage, or to the sick tent."<br/><br/>But here a sort of scene began to ensue:<br/>  The ladies,--who by no means had been bred<br/>To be disposed of in a way so new,<br/>  Although their Harem education led,<br/>Doubtless, to that of doctrines the most true,<br/>  Passive obedience,--now raised up the head<br/>With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung<br/>Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,<br/><br/>O'er the promoted couple of brave men<br/>  Who were thus honoured by the greatest Chief<br/>That ever peopled Hell with heroes slain,<br/>  Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.<br/>Oh, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!<br/>  Oh, glorious Laurel! since for one sole leaf<br/>Of thine imaginary deathless tree,<br/>Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.<br/><br/>Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,<br/>  And not much sympathy for blood, surveyed<br/>The women with their hair about their ears<br/>  And natural agonies, with a slight shade<br/>Of feeling: for however Habit sears<br/>  Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade<br/>Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow<br/>Will touch even heroes--and such was Suwarrow.<br/><br/>He said,--and in the kindest Calmuck tone,--<br/>  "Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean<br/>By bringing women here? They shall be shown<br/>  All the attention possible, and seen<br/>In safety to the waggons, where alone<br/>  In fact they can be safe. You should have been<br/>Aware this kind of baggage never thrives;<br/>Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives"--<br/><br/>"May it please your Excellency," thus replied<br/>  Our British friend, "these are the wives of others,<br/>And not our own. I am too qualified<br/>  By service with my military brothers<br/>To break the rules by bringing one's own bride<br/>  Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers<br/>The hearts of the heroic on a charge,<br/>As leaving a small family at large.<br/><br/>"But these are but two Turkish ladies, who<br/>  With their attendant aided our escape,<br/>And afterwards accompanied us through<br/>  A thousand perils in this dubious shape.<br/>To me this kind of life is not so new;<br/>  To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape:<br/>I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,<br/>Request that they may both be used genteelly."<br/><br/>Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,<br/>  Looked on as if in doubt if they could trust<br/>Their own protectors; nor was their surprise<br/>  Less than their grief (and truly not less just)<br/>To see an old man, rather wild than wise<br/>  In aspect, plainly clad, besmeared with dust,<br/>Stripped to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,<br/>More feared than all the Sultans ever seen.<br/><br/>For everything seemed resting on his nod,<br/>  As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,<br/>Who were accustomed, as a sort of god,<br/>  To see the Sultan, rich in many a gem,<br/>Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad<br/>  (That royal bird, whose tail's a diadem,)<br/>With all the pomp of Power, it was a doubt<br/>How Power could condescend to do without.<br/><br/>John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,<br/>  Though little versed in feelings oriental,<br/>Suggested some slight comfort in his way:<br/>  Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,<br/>Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,<br/>  Or that the Russian army should repent all:<br/>And, strange to say, they found some consolation<br/>In this--for females like exaggeration.<br/><br/>And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,<br/>  They parted for the present--these to await,<br/>According to the artillery's hits or misses,<br/>  What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate--<br/>(Uncertainty is one of many blisses,<br/>  A mortgage on Humanity's estate;)<br/>While their belov√©d friends began to arm,<br/>To burn a town which never did them harm.<br/><br/>Suwarrow,--who but saw things in the gross.<br/>  Being much too gross to see them in detail,<br/>Who calculated life as so much dross,<br/>  And as the wind a widowed nation's wail,<br/>And cared as little for his army's loss<br/>  (So that their efforts should at length prevail)<br/>As wife and friends did for the boils of Job,--<br/>What was 't to him to hear two women sob?<br/><br/>Nothing.--The work of Glory still went on<br/>  In preparations for a cannonade<br/>As terrible as that of Ilion,<br/>  If Homer had found mortars ready made;<br/>But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,<br/>  We only can but talk of escalade,<br/>Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets--<br/>Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.<br/><br/>Oh, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm<br/>  All ears, though long; all ages, though so short,<br/>By merely wielding with poetic arm<br/>  Arms to which men will never more resort,<br/>Unless gunpowder should be found to harm<br/>  Much less than is the hope of every court,<br/>Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;<br/>But they will not find Liberty a Troy:--<br/><br/>Oh, thou eternal Homer! I have now<br/>  To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,<br/>With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,<br/>  Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;<br/>And yet, like all men else, I must allow,<br/>  To vie with thee would be about as vain<br/>As for a brook to cope with Ocean's flood,--<br/>But still we moderns equal you in blood:<br/><br/>If not in poetry, at least in fact;<br/>  And fact is Truth, the grand desideratum!<br/>Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,<br/>  There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.<br/>But now the town is going to be attacked;<br/>  Great deeds are doing--how shall I relate 'em?<br/>Souls of immortal Generals! Phoebus watches<br/>To colour up his rays from your despatches.<br/><br/>Oh, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!<br/>  Oh, ye less grand long lists of killed and wounded!<br/>Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,<br/>  When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!<br/>Oh, C√¶sar's Commentaries! now impart, ye<br/>  Shadows of Glory! (lest I be confounded),<br/>A portion of your fading twilight hues--<br/>So beautiful, so fleeting--to the Muse.<br/><br/>When I call "fading" martial immortality,<br/>  I mean, that every age and every year,<br/>And almost every day, in sad reality,<br/>  Some sucking hero is compelled to rear,<br/>Who, when we come to sum up the totality<br/>  Of deeds to human happiness most dear,<br/>Turns out to be a butcher in great business,<br/>Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.<br/><br/>Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,<br/>  Are things immortal to immortal man,<br/>As purple to the Babylonian harlot;<br/>  An uniform to boys is like a fan<br/>To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet<br/>  But deems himself the first in Glory's van.<br/>But Glory's glory; and if you would find<br/>What _that_ is--ask the pig who sees the wind!<br/><br/>At least _he feels it_, and some say he _sees_,<br/>  Because he runs before it like a pig;<br/>Or, if that simple sentence should displease,<br/>  Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,<br/>A schooner, or--but it is time to ease<br/>  This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.<br/>The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,<br/>Like a bob-major from a village steeple.<br/><br/>Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,<br/>  The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!<br/>Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight<br/>  Along the leaguered wall and bristling bank<br/>Of the armed river, while with straggling light<br/>  The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,<br/>Which curl in various wreaths:--how soon the smoke<br/>Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!<br/><br/>Here pause we for the present--as even then<br/>  That awful pause, dividing Life from Death,<br/>Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,--<br/>  Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!<br/>A moment--and all will be Life again!<br/>  The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith,<br/>Hurrah! and Allah! and one moment more--<br/>The death-cry drowning in the Battle's roar.<br/><br/>CANTO THE EIGHTH.<br/><br/>Oh, blood and thunder! and oh, blood and wounds!<br/>  These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,<br/>Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:--<br/>  And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream<br/>Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds<br/>  At present such things, since they are her theme,<br/>So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,<br/>Bellona, what you will--they mean but wars.<br/><br/>All was prepared--the fire, the sword, the men<br/>  To wield them in their terrible array,--<br/>The army, like a lion from his den,<br/>  Marched forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,--<br/>A human Hydra, issuing from its fen<br/>  To breathe destruction on its winding way,<br/>Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain<br/>Immediately in others grew again.<br/><br/>History can only take things in the gross;<br/>  But could we know them in detail, perchance<br/>In balancing the profit and the loss,<br/>  War's merit it by no means might enhance,<br/>To waste so much gold for a little dross,<br/>  As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.<br/>The drying up a single tear has more<br/>Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.<br/><br/>And why?--because it brings self-approbation;<br/>  Whereas the other, after all its glare,<br/>Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,<br/>  Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,<br/>A higher title, or a loftier station,<br/>  Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,<br/>Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,<br/>Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.<br/><br/>And such they are--and such they will be found:<br/>  Not so Leonidas and Washington,<br/>Whose every battle-field is holy ground,<br/>  Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.<br/>How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!<br/>  While the mere victor's may appal or stun<br/>The servile and the vain--such names will be<br/>A watchword till the Future shall be free.<br/><br/>The night was dark, and the thick mist allowed<br/>  Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,<br/>Which arched the horizon like a fiery cloud,<br/>  And in the Danube's waters shone the same--<br/>A mirrored Hell! the volleying roar, and loud<br/>  Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame<br/>The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes<br/>Spare, or smite rarely--Man's make millions ashes!<br/><br/>The column ordered on the assault scarce passed<br/>  Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,<br/>When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,<br/>  Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:<br/>Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,<br/>  Which rocked as 't were beneath the mighty noises;<br/>While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when<br/>The restless Titan hiccups in his den;<br/><br/>And one enormous shout of "Allah!" rose<br/>  In the same moment, loud as even the roar<br/>Of War's most mortal engines, to their foes<br/>  Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore<br/>Resounded "Allah!" and the clouds which close<br/>  With thickening canopy the conflict o'er,<br/>Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through<br/>All sounds it pierceth--"Allah! Allah Hu!"<br/><br/>The columns were in movement one and all,<br/>  But of the portion which attacked by water,<br/>Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,<br/>  Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,<br/>As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.<br/>  "Carnage" (so Wordsworth tells you) "is God's daughter:"<br/>If _he_ speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and<br/>Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.<br/><br/>The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;<br/>  Count Chapeau-Bras,--too, had a ball between<br/>His cap and head, which proves the head to be<br/>  Aristocratic as was ever seen,<br/>Because it then received no injury<br/>  More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean<br/>No harm unto a right legitimate head;<br/>"Ashes to ashes"--why not lead to lead?<br/><br/>Also the General Markow, Brigadier,<br/>  Insisting on removal of _the Prince_<br/>Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,--<br/>  All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,<br/>And shriek for water into a deaf ear,--<br/>  The General Markow, who could thus evince<br/>His sympathy for rank, by the same token,<br/>To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.<br/><br/>Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,<br/>  And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills<br/>Like hail, to make a bloody Diuretic.<br/>  Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills:<br/>Thy plagues--thy famines--thy physicians--yet tick,<br/>  Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills<br/>Past, present, and to come;--but all may yield<br/>To the true portrait of one battle-field;<br/><br/>There the still varying pangs, which multiply<br/>  Until their very number makes men hard<br/>By the infinities of agony,<br/>  Which meet the gaze, whate'er it may regard--<br/>The groan, the roll in dust, the all-_white_ eye<br/>  Turned back within its socket,--these reward<br/>Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest<br/>May win perhaps a riband at the breast!<br/><br/>Yet I love Glory;--Glory's a great thing:--<br/>  Think what it is to be in your old age<br/>Maintained at the expense of your good King:<br/>  A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,<br/>And Heroes are but made for bards to sing,<br/>  Which is still better--thus, in verse, to wage<br/>Your wars eternally, besides enjoying<br/>Half-pay for life, make Mankind worth destroying.<br/><br/>The troops, already disembarked, pushed on<br/>  To take a battery on the right: the others,<br/>Who landed lower down, their landing done,<br/>  Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:<br/>Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,<br/>  Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,<br/>O'er the intrenchment and the palisade,<br/>Quite orderly, as if upon parade.<br/><br/>And this was admirable: for so hot<br/>  The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,<br/>Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot<br/>  And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.<br/>Of officers a third fell on the spot,<br/>  A thing which Victory by no means boded<br/>To gentlemen engaged in the assault:<br/>Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.<br/><br/>But here I leave the general concern<br/>  To track our Hero on his path of Fame:<br/>He must his laurels separately earn--<br/>  For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,<br/>Though all deserving equally to turn<br/>  A couplet, or an elegy to claim,<br/>Would form a lengthy lexicon of Glory,<br/>And, what is worse still, a much longer story:<br/><br/>And therefore we must give the greater number<br/>  To the Gazette--which doubtless fairly dealt<br/>By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber<br/>  In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt<br/>Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;--<br/>  Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt<br/>In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss<br/>Was printed _Grove_, although his name was Grose.<br/><br/>Juan and Johnson joined a certain corps,<br/>  And fought away with might and main, not knowing<br/>The way which they had never trod before,<br/>  And still less guessing where they might be going;<br/>But on they marched, dead bodies trampling o'er,<br/>  Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,<br/>But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,<br/>To their _two_ selves, _one_ whole bright bulletin.<br/><br/>Thus on they wallowed in the bloody mire<br/>  Of dead and dying thousands,--sometimes gaining<br/>A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher<br/>  To some odd angle for which all were straining;<br/>At other times, repulsed by the close fire,<br/>  Which really poured as if all Hell were raining<br/>Instead of Heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er<br/>A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.<br/><br/>Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though<br/>  The nightly muster and the silent march<br/>In the chill dark, when Courage does not glow<br/>  So much as under a triumphal arch,<br/>Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw<br/>  A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,<br/>Which stiffened Heaven) as if he wished for day;--<br/>Yet for all this he did not run away.<br/><br/>Indeed he could not. But what if he had?<br/>  There _have been_ and _are_ heroes who begun<br/>With something not much better, or as bad:<br/>  Frederick the Great from Molwitz deigned to run,<br/>For the first and last time; for, like a pad,<br/>  Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one<br/>Warm bout are broken in to their new tricks,<br/>And fight like fiends for pay or politics.<br/><br/>He was what Erin calls, in her sublime<br/>  Old Erse or Irish, or it may be _Punic_;--<br/>(The antiquarians--who can settle Time,<br/>  Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic--<br/>Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime<br/>  With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic<br/>Of Dido's alphabet--and this is rational<br/>As any other notion, and not national;)--<br/><br/>But Juan was quite "a broth of a boy,"<br/>  A thing of impulse and a child of song;<br/>Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,<br/>  Or the _sensation_ (if that phrase seem wrong),<br/>And afterward, if he must needs destroy,<br/>  In such good company as always throng<br/>To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,<br/>No less delighted to employ his leisure;<br/><br/>But always without malice: if he warred<br/>  Or loved, it was with what we call "the best<br/>Intentions," which form all Mankind's _trump card_,<br/>  To be produced when brought up to the test.<br/>The statesman--hero--harlot--lawyer--ward<br/>  Off each attack, when people are in quest<br/>Of their designs, by saying they _meant well_;<br/>'T is pity "that such meaning should pave Hell."<br/><br/>I almost lately have begun to doubt<br/>  Whether Hell's pavement--if it be so _paved_--<br/>Must not have latterly been quite worn out,<br/>  Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,<br/>But by the mass who go below without<br/>  Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved<br/>And smoothed the brimstone of that street of Hell<br/>Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.<br/><br/>Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides<br/>  Warrior from warrior in their grim career,<br/>Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides<br/>  Just at the close of the first bridal year,<br/>By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,<br/>  Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,<br/>When, after a good deal of heavy firing,<br/>He found himself alone, and friends retiring.<br/><br/>I don't know how the thing occurred--it might<br/>  Be that the greater part were killed or wounded,<br/>And that the rest had faced unto the right<br/>  About; a circumstance which has confounded<br/>C√¶sar himself, who, in the very sight<br/>  Of his whole army, which so much abounded<br/>In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,<br/>And rally back his Romans to the field.<br/><br/>Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was<br/>  No C√¶sar, but a fine young lad, who fought<br/>He knew not why, arriving at this pass,<br/>  Stopped for a minute, as perhaps he ought<br/>For a much longer time; then, like an ass<br/>  (Start not, kind reader, since great Homer thought<br/>This simile enough for Ajax, Juan<br/>Perhaps may find it better than a new one);<br/><br/>Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,<br/>  And, what was stranger, never looked behind;<br/>But seeing, flashing forward, like the day<br/>  Over the hills, a fire enough to blind<br/>Those who dislike to look upon a fray,<br/>  He stumbled on, to try if he could find<br/>A path, to add his own slight arm and forces<br/>To corps, the greater part of which were corses.<br/><br/>Perceiving then no more the commandant<br/>  Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had<br/>Quite disappeared--the gods know how! (I can't<br/>  Account for everything which may look bad<br/>In history; but we at least may grant<br/>  It was not marvellous that a mere lad,<br/>In search of Glory, should look on before,<br/>Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps:)--<br/><br/>Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,<br/>  And left at large, like a young heir, to make<br/>His way to--where he knew not--single handed;<br/>  As travellers follow over bog and brake<br/>An "ignis fatuus;" or as sailors stranded<br/>  Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;<br/>So Juan, following Honour and his nose,<br/>Rushed where the thickest fire announced most foes.<br/><br/>He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,<br/>  For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins<br/>Filled as with lightning--for his spirit shared<br/>  The hour, as is the case with lively brains;<br/>And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,<br/>  And the loud cannon pealed his hoarsest strains,<br/>He rushed, while earth and air were sadly shaken<br/>By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!<br/><br/>And as he rushed along, it came to pass he<br/>  Fell in with what was late the second column,<br/>Under the orders of the General Lascy,<br/>  But now reduced, as is a bulky volume<br/>Into an elegant extract (much less massy)<br/>  Of heroism, and took his place with solemn<br/>Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces<br/>And levelled weapons still against the Glacis.<br/><br/>Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,<br/>  Who had "retreated," as the phrase is when<br/>Men run away much rather than go through<br/>  Destruction's jaws into the Devil's den;<br/>But Johnson was a clever fellow, who<br/>  Knew when and how "to cut and come again,"<br/>And never ran away, except when running<br/>Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.<br/><br/>And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,<br/>  Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose<br/>More virgin valour never dreamt of flying,<br/>  From ignorance of danger, which indues<br/>Its votaries, like Innocence relying<br/>  On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,--<br/>Johnson retired a little, just to rally<br/>Those who catch cold in "shadows of Death's valley."<br/><br/>And there, a little sheltered from the shot,<br/>  Which rained from bastion, battery, parapet,<br/>Rampart, wall, casement, house--for there was not<br/>  In this extensive city, sore beset<br/>By Christian soldiery, a single spot<br/>  Which did not combat like the Devil, as yet,--<br/>He found a number of Chasseurs, all scattered<br/>By the resistance of the chase they battered.<br/><br/>And these he called on; and, what 's strange, they came<br/>  Unto his call, unlike "the spirits from<br/>The vasty deep," to whom you may exclaim,<br/>  Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home:--<br/>Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame<br/>  At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,<br/>And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds<br/>Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.<br/><br/>By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,<br/>  And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,<br/>Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon<br/>  We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his<br/>Man quite as quietly as blows the Monsoon<br/>  Her steady breath (which some months the same _still_ is):<br/>Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,<br/>And could be very busy without bustle;<br/><br/>And therefore, when he ran away, he did so<br/>  Upon reflection, knowing that behind<br/>He would find others who would fain be rid so<br/>  Of idle apprehensions, which like wind<br/>Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so<br/>  Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,<br/>But when they light upon immediate death,<br/>Retire a little, merely to take breath.<br/><br/>But Johnson only ran off, to return<br/>  With many other warriors, as we said,<br/>Unto that rather somewhat misty bourne,<br/>  Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.<br/>To Jack, howe'er, this gave but slight concern:<br/>  His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)<br/>Acted upon the living as on wire,<br/>And led them back into the heaviest fire.<br/><br/>Egad! they found the second time what they<br/>  The first time thought quite terrible enough<br/>To fly from, malgr√© all which people say<br/>  Of Glory, and all that immortal stuff<br/>Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,<br/>  That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)--<br/>They found on their return the self-same welcome,<br/>Which made some _think_, and others _know_, a _hell_ come.<br/><br/>They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,<br/>  Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,<br/>Proving that trite old truth, that Life's as frail<br/>  As any other boon for which men stickle.<br/>The Turkish batteries thrashed them like a flail,<br/>  Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle<br/>Putting the very bravest, who were knocked<br/>Upon the head before their guns were cocked.<br/><br/>The Turks behind the traverses and flanks<br/>  Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,<br/>And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:<br/>  However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels<br/>Towns--nations--worlds, in her revolving pranks,<br/>  So ordered it, amidst these sulphury revels,<br/>That Johnson, and some few who had not scampered,<br/>Reached the interior "talus" of the rampart.<br/><br/>First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen<br/>  Came mounting quickly up, for it was now<br/>All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,<br/>  Flame was showered forth above, as well 's below,<br/>So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,<br/>  The gentlemen that were the first to show<br/>Their martial faces on the parapet,<br/>Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.<br/><br/>But those who scaled, found out that their advance<br/>  Was favoured by an accident or blunder:<br/>The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance<br/>  Had pallisadoed in a way you'd wonder<br/>To see in forts of Netherlands or France--<br/>  (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)--<br/>Right in the middle of the parapet<br/>Just named, these palisades were primly set:<br/><br/>So that on either side some nine or ten<br/>  Paces were left, whereon you could contrive<br/>To march; a great convenience to our men,<br/>  At least to all those who were left alive,<br/>Who thus could form a line and fight again;<br/>  And that which farther aided them to strive<br/>Was, that they could kick down the palisades,<br/>Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.<br/><br/>Among the first,--I will not say _the first_,<br/>  For such precedence upon such occasions<br/>Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst<br/>  Out between friends as well as allied nations:<br/>The Briton must be bold who really durst<br/>  Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,<br/>As say that Wellington at Waterloo<br/>Was beaten,--though the Prussians say so too;--<br/><br/>And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,<br/>  And God knows who besides in "au" and "ow,"<br/>Had not come up in time to cast an awe<br/>  Into the hearts of those who fought till now<br/>As tigers combat with an empty craw,<br/>  The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show<br/>His Orders--also to receive his pensions,<br/>Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.<br/><br/>But never mind;--"God save the King!" and _Kings!_<br/>  For if _he_ don't, I doubt if _men_ will longer--<br/>I think I hear a little bird, who sings<br/>  The people by and by will be the stronger:<br/>The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings<br/>  So much into the raw as quite to wrong her<br/>Beyond the rules of posting,--and the mob<br/>At last fall sick of imitating Job.<br/><br/>At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,<br/>  Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a Giant;<br/>At last it takes to weapons such as men<br/>  Snatch when Despair makes human hearts less pliant.<br/>Then comes "the tug of war;"--'t will come again,<br/>  I rather doubt; and I would fain say "fie on 't,"<br/>If I had not perceived that Revolution<br/>Alone can save the earth from Hell's pollution.<br/><br/>But to continue:--I say not _the_ first,<br/>  But of the first, our little friend Don Juan<br/>Walked o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed<br/>  Amidst such scenes--though this was quite a new one<br/>To him, and I should hope to _most_. The thirst<br/>  Of Glory, which so pierces through and through one,<br/>Pervaded him--although a generous creature,<br/>As warm in heart as feminine in feature.<br/><br/>And here he was--who upon Woman's breast,<br/>  Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er<br/>The Man in all the rest might be confessed,<br/>  To him it was Elysium to be there;<br/>And he could even withstand that awkward test<br/>  Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,<br/>"Observe your lover when he _leaves_ your arms;"<br/>But Juan never _left_ them--while they had charms,<br/><br/>Unless compelled by Fate, or wave, or wind,<br/>  Or near relations--who are much the same.<br/>But _here_ he was!--where each tie that can bind<br/>  Humanity must yield to steel and flame:<br/>And _he_ whose very body was all mind,<br/>  Flung here by Fate or Circumstance, which tame<br/>The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,<br/>Dashed on like a spurred blood-horse in a race.<br/><br/>So was his blood stirred while he found resistance,<br/>  As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,<br/>Or double post and rail, where the existence<br/>  Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight--The<br/>lightest being the safest: at a distance<br/>  He hated cruelty, as all men hate<br/>Blood, until heated--and even then his own<br/>At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.<br/><br/>The General Lascy, who had been hard pressed,<br/>  Seeing arrive an aid so opportune<br/>As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,<br/>  Who came as if just dropped down from the moon<br/>To Juan, who was nearest him, addressed<br/>  His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,<br/>Not reckoning him to be a "base Bezonian"<br/>(As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.<br/><br/>Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew<br/>  As much of German as of Sanscrit, and<br/>In answer made an inclination to<br/>  The General who held him in command;<br/>For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,<br/>  Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,<br/>Addressing him in tones which seemed to thank,<br/>He recognised an officer of rank.<br/><br/>Short speeches pass between two men who speak<br/>  No common language; and besides, in time<br/>Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek<br/>  Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime<br/>Is perpetrated ere a word can break<br/>  Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime<br/>In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,<br/>There cannot be much conversation there.<br/><br/>And therefore all we have related in<br/>  Two long octaves, passed in a little minute;<br/>But in the same small minute, every sin<br/>  Contrived to get itself comprised within it.<br/>The very cannon, deafened by the din,<br/>  Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,<br/>As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise<br/>Of Human Nature's agonizing voice!<br/><br/>The town was entered. Oh Eternity!--<br/>  "God made the country, and man made the town,"<br/>So Cowper says--and I begin to be<br/>  Of his opinion, when I see cast down<br/>Rome--Babylon-Tyre-Carthage--Nineveh--<br/>  All walls men know, and many never known;<br/>And pondering on the present and the past,<br/>To deem the woods shall be our home at last:--<br/><br/>Of all men, saving Sylla, the man-slayer,<br/>  Who passes for in life and death most lucky,<br/>Of the great names which in our faces stare,<br/>  The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,<br/>Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;<br/>  For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he<br/>Enjoyed the lonely, vigorous, harmless days<br/>Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.<br/><br/>Crime came not near him--she is not the child<br/>  Of solitude; Health shrank not from him--for<br/>Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,<br/>  Where if men seek her not, and death be more<br/>Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled<br/>  By habit to what their own hearts abhor--<br/>In cities caged. The present case in point I<br/>Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;<br/><br/>And, what's still stranger, left behind a name<br/>  For which men vainly decimate the throng,<br/>Not only famous, but of that _good_ fame,<br/>  Without which Glory's but a tavern song--<br/>Simple, serene, the _antipodes_ of Shame,<br/>  Which Hate nor Envy e'er could tinge with wrong;<br/>An active hermit, even in age the child<br/>Of Nature--or the Man of Ross run wild.<br/><br/>'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,<br/>  When they built up unto his darling trees,--<br/>He moved some hundred miles off, for a station<br/>  Where there were fewer houses and more ease;<br/>The inconvenience of civilisation<br/>  Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;<br/>But where he met the individual man,<br/>He showed himself as kind as mortal can.<br/><br/>He was not all alone: around him grew<br/>  A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,<br/>Whose young, unwakened world was ever new,<br/>  Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace<br/>On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view<br/>  A frown on Nature's or on human face;<br/>The free-born forest found and kept them free,<br/>And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.<br/><br/>And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,<br/>  Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,<br/>Because their thoughts had never been the prey<br/>  Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;<br/>No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,<br/>  No fashion made them apes of her distortions;<br/>Simple they were, not savage--and their rifles,<br/>Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.<br/><br/>Motion was in their days, Rest in their slumbers,<br/>  And Cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;<br/>Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;<br/>  Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;<br/>The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,<br/>  With the free foresters divide no spoil;<br/>Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes<br/>Of this unsighing people of the woods.<br/><br/>So much for Nature:--by way of variety,<br/>  Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!<br/>And the sweet consequence of large society,<br/>  War--pestilence--the despot's desolation,<br/>The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,<br/>  The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,<br/>The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,<br/>With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.<br/><br/>The town was entered: first one column made<br/>  Its sanguinary way good--then another;<br/>The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade<br/>  Clashed 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother<br/>With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:--<br/>  Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother<br/>The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot<br/>The maddened Turks their city still dispute.<br/><br/>Koutousow, he who afterwards beat back<br/>  (With some assistance from the frost and snow)<br/>Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,<br/>  It happened was himself beat back just now:<br/>He was a jolly fellow, and could crack<br/>  His jest alike in face of friend or foe,<br/>Though Life, and Death, and Victory were at stake;<br/>But here it seemed his jokes had ceased to take:<br/><br/>For having thrown himself into a ditch,<br/>  Followed in haste by various grenadiers,<br/>Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,<br/>  He climbed to where the parapet appears;<br/>But there his project reached its utmost pitch<br/>  ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's<br/>Was much regretted), for the Moslem men<br/>Threw them all down into the ditch again.<br/><br/>And had it not been for some stray troops landing<br/>  They knew not where, being carried by the stream<br/>To some spot, where they lost their understanding,<br/>  And wandered up and down as in a dream,<br/>Until they reached, as daybreak was expanding,<br/>  That which a portal to their eyes did seem,--<br/>The great and gay Koutousow might have lain<br/>Where three parts of his column yet remain.<br/><br/>And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,<br/>  After the taking of the "Cavalier,"<br/>Just as Koutousow's most "forlorn" of "hopes"<br/>  Took, like chameleons, some slight tinge of fear,<br/>Opened the gate called "Kilia," to the groups<br/>  Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,<br/>Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,<br/>Now thawed into a marsh of human blood.<br/><br/>The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques--<br/>  (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,<br/>So that I do not grossly err in facts,<br/>  Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)--<br/>Having been used to serve on horses' backs,<br/>  And no great dilettanti in topography<br/>Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases<br/>Their chiefs to order,--were all cut to pieces.<br/><br/>Their column, though the Turkish batteries thundered<br/>  Upon them, ne'ertheless had reached the rampart,<br/>And naturally thought they could have plundered<br/>  The city, without being farther hampered;<br/>But as it happens to brave men, they blundered--<br/>  The Turks at first pretended to have scampered,<br/>Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,<br/>From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.<br/><br/>Then being taken by the tail--a taking<br/>  Fatal to bishops as to soldiers--these<br/>Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,<br/>  And found their lives were let at a short lease--But<br/>perished without shivering or shaking,<br/>  Leaving as ladders their heaped carcasses,<br/>O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi<br/>Marched with the brave battalion of Polouzki:--<br/><br/>This valiant man killed all the Turks he met,<br/>  But could not eat them, being in his turn<br/>Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,<br/>  Without resistance, see their city burn.<br/>The walls were won, but 't was an even bet<br/>  Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:<br/>'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,<br/>For one would not retreat, nor 't other flinch.<br/><br/>Another column also suffered much:--<br/>  And here we may remark with the historian,<br/>You should but give few cartridges to such<br/>  Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:<br/>When matters must be carried by the touch<br/>  Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on;<br/>They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,<br/>Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.<br/><br/>A junction of the General Meknop's men<br/>  (Without the General, who had fallen some time<br/>Before, being badly seconded just then)<br/>  Was made at length with those who dared to climb<br/>The death-disgorging rampart once again;<br/>  And, though the Turk's resistance was sublime,<br/>They took the bastion, which the Seraskier<br/>Defended at a price extremely dear.<br/><br/>Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,<br/>  Among the foremost, offered him good quarter,<br/>A word which little suits with Seraskiers,<br/>  Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.<br/>He died, deserving well his country's tears,<br/>  A savage sort of military martyr:<br/>An English naval officer, who wished<br/>To make him prisoner, was also dished:<br/><br/>For all the answer to his proposition<br/>  Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;<br/>On which the rest, without more intermission,<br/>  Began to lay about with steel and lead--<br/>The pious metals most in requisition<br/>  On such occasions: not a single head<br/>Was spared;--three thousand Moslems perished here,<br/>And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.<br/><br/>The city's taken--only part by part--<br/>  And Death is drunk with gore: there's not a street<br/>Where fights not to the last some desperate heart<br/>  For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.<br/>Here War forgot his own destructive art<br/>  In more destroying Nature; and the heat<br/>Of Carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,<br/>Engendered monstrous shapes of every crime.<br/><br/>A Russian officer, in martial tread<br/>  Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel<br/>Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head<br/>  Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel;<br/>In vain he kicked, and swore, and writhed, and bled,<br/>  And howled for help as wolves do for a meal--<br/>The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,<br/>As do the subtle snakes described of old.<br/><br/>A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot<br/>  Of a foe o'er him, snatched at it, and bit<br/>The very tendon which is most acute--<br/>  (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit<br/>Named after thee, Achilles!) and quite through 't<br/>  He made the teeth meet, nor relinquished it<br/>Even with his life--for (but they lie) 't is said<br/>To the live leg still clung the severed head.<br/><br/>However this may be, 't is pretty sure<br/>  The Russian officer for life was lamed,<br/>For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,<br/>  And left him 'midst the invalid and maimed:<br/>The regimental surgeon could not cure<br/>  His patient, and, perhaps, was to be blamed<br/>More than the head of the inveterate foe,<br/>Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.<br/><br/>But then the fact's a fact--and 't is the part<br/>  Of a true poet to escape from fiction<br/>Whene'er he can; for there is little art<br/>  in leaving verse more free from the restriction<br/>Of Truth than prose, unless to suit the mart<br/>  For what is sometimes called poetic diction,<br/>And that outrageous appetite for lies<br/>Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.<br/><br/>The city's taken, but not rendered!--No!<br/>  There's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:<br/>The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow<br/>  Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word<br/>Acknowledge aught of dread of Death or foe:<br/>  In vain the yell of victory is roared<br/>By the advancing Muscovite--the groan<br/>Of the last foe is echoed by his own.<br/><br/>The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,<br/>  And human lives are lavished everywhere,<br/>As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves<br/>  When the stripped forest bows to the bleak air,<br/>And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,<br/>  Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;<br/>But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,<br/>As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.<br/><br/>It is an awful topic--but 't is not<br/>  My cue for any time to be terrific:<br/>For checkered as is seen our human lot<br/>  With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific<br/>Of melancholy merriment, to quote<br/>  Too much of one sort would be soporific;--<br/>Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,<br/>I sketch your world exactly as it goes.<br/><br/>And one good action in the midst of crimes<br/>  Is "quite refreshing," in the affected phrase<br/>Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,<br/>  With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,<br/>And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,<br/>  A little scorched at present with the blaze<br/>Of conquest and its consequences, which<br/>Make Epic poesy so rare and rich.<br/><br/>Upon a taken bastion, where there lay<br/>  Thousands of slaughtered men, a yet warm group<br/>Of murdered women, who had found their way<br/>  To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop<br/>And shudder;--while, as beautiful as May,<br/>  A female child of ten years tried to stoop<br/>And hide her little palpitating breast<br/>Amidst the bodies lulled in bloody rest.<br/><br/>Two villanous Cossacques pursued the child<br/>  With flashing eyes and weapons: matched with _them_,<br/>The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild<br/>  Has feelings pure and polished as a gem,--<br/>The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;<br/>  And whom for this at last must we condemn?<br/>Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ<br/>All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?<br/><br/>Their sabres glittered o'er her little head,<br/>  Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,<br/>Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:<br/>  When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,<br/>I shall not say exactly what he _said_,<br/>  Because it might not solace "ears polite;"<br/>But what he _did_, was to lay on their backs,<br/>The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.<br/><br/>One's hip he slashed, and split the other's shoulder,<br/>  And drove them with their brutal yells to seek<br/>If there might be chirurgeons who could solder<br/>  The wounds they richly merited, and shriek<br/>Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder<br/>  As he turned o'er each pale and gory cheek,<br/>Don Juan raised his little captive from<br/>The heap a moment more had made her tomb.<br/><br/>And she was chill as they, and on her face<br/>  A slender streak of blood announced how near<br/>Her fate had been to that of all her race;<br/>  For the same blow which laid her mother here<br/>Had scarred her brow, and left its crimson trace,<br/>  As the last link with all she had held dear;<br/>But else unhurt, she opened her large eyes,<br/>And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.<br/><br/>Just at this instant, while their eyes were fixed<br/>  Upon each other, with dilated glance,<br/>In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mixed<br/>  With joy to save, and dread of some mischance<br/>Unto his prot√©g√©e; while hers, transfixed<br/>  With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,<br/>A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,<br/>Like to a lighted alabaster vase:--<br/><br/>Up came John Johnson (I will not say _"Jack,"_<br/>  For that were vulgar, cold, and common-place<br/>On great occasions, such as an attack<br/>  On cities, as hath been the present case):<br/>Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,<br/>  Exclaiming--"Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace<br/>Your arm, and I'll bet Moscow to a dollar,<br/>That you and I will win St. George's collar.<br/><br/>"The Seraskier is knocked upon the head,<br/>  But the stone bastion still remains, wherein<br/>The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,<br/>  Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din<br/>Of our artillery and his own: 't is said<br/>  Our killed, already piled up to the chin,<br/>Lie round the battery; but still it batters,<br/>And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.<br/><br/>"Then up with me!"--But Juan answered, "Look<br/>  Upon this child--I saved her--must not leave<br/>Her life to chance; but point me out some nook<br/>  Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,<br/>And I am with you."--Whereon Johnson took<br/>  A glance around--and shrugged--and twitched his sleeve<br/>And black silk neckcloth--and replied, "You're right;<br/>Poor thing! what's to be done? I'm puzzled quite."<br/><br/>Said Juan--"Whatsoever is to be<br/>  Done, I'll not quit her till she seems secure<br/>Of present life a good deal more than we."--<br/>  Quoth Johnson--"_Neither_ will I quite insure;<br/>But at the least _you_ may die gloriously."--<br/>  Juan replied--" At least I will endure<br/>Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign<br/>This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine."<br/><br/>Johnson said--"Juan, we've no time to lose;<br/>  The child's a pretty child--a very pretty--<br/>I never saw such eyes--but hark! now choose<br/>  Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity:--<br/>Hark! how the roar increases!--no excuse<br/>  Will serve when there is plunder in a city;--<br/>I should be loath to march without you, but,<br/>By God! we'll be too late for the first cut."<br/><br/>But Juan was immovable; until<br/>  Johnson, who really loved him in his way,<br/>Picked out amongst his followers with some skill<br/>  Such as he thought the least given up to prey,<br/>And, swearing, if the infant came to ill<br/>  That they should all be shot on the next day,--<br/>But if she were delivered safe and sound,<br/>They should at least have fifty rubles round,<br/><br/>And all allowances besides of plunder<br/>  In fair proportion with their comrades;--then<br/>Juan consented to march on through thunder,<br/>  Which thinned at every step their ranks of men:<br/>And yet the rest rushed eagerly--no wonder,<br/>  For they were heated by the hope of gain,<br/>A thing which happens everywhere each day--<br/>No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.<br/><br/>And such is Victory, and such is Man!<br/>  At least nine tenths of what we call so:--God<br/>May have another name for half we scan<br/>  As human beings, or his ways are odd.<br/>But to our subject: a brave Tartar Khan--<br/>  Or "Sultan," as the author (to whose nod<br/>In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call<br/>This chieftain--somehow would not yield at all:<br/><br/>But flanked by _five_ brave sons (such is polygamy,<br/>  That she spawns warriors by the score, where none<br/>Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),<br/>  He never would believe the city won<br/>While Courage clung but to a single twig.--Am I<br/>  Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?<br/>Neither--but a good, plain, old, temperate man,<br/>Who fought with his five children in the van.<br/><br/>To _take_ him was the point.--The truly brave,<br/>  When they behold the brave oppressed with odds,<br/>Are touched with a desire to shield and save;--<br/>  A mixture of wild beasts and demi-gods<br/>Are they--now furious as the sweeping wave,<br/>  Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods<br/>The rugged tree unto the summer wind,<br/>Compassion breathes along the savage mind.<br/><br/>But he would _not_ be _taken_, and replied<br/>  To all the propositions of surrender<br/>By mowing Christians down on every side,<br/>  As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.<br/>His five brave boys no less the foe defied;<br/>  Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender<br/>As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,<br/>Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.<br/><br/>And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who<br/>  Expended all their Eastern phraseology<br/>In begging him, for God's sake, just to show<br/>  So much less fight as might form an apology<br/>For _them_ in saving such a desperate foe--<br/>  He hewed away, like Doctors of Theology<br/>When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses<br/>Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.<br/><br/>Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both<br/>  Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,<br/>The first with sighs, the second with an oath,<br/>  Upon his angry Sultanship, pell-mell,<br/>And all around were grown exceeding wroth<br/>  At such a pertinacious infidel,<br/>And poured upon him and his sons like rain,<br/>Which they resisted like a sandy plain<br/><br/>That drinks and still is dry. At last they perished--<br/>  His second son was levelled by a shot;<br/>His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherished<br/>  Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;<br/>The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourished,<br/>  Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,<br/>Because deformed, yet died all game and bottom,<br/>To save a Sire who blushed that he begot him.<br/><br/>The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,<br/>  As great a scorner of the Nazarene<br/>As ever Mahomet picked out for a martyr,<br/>  Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,<br/>Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter<br/>  On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,<br/>Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,<br/>Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.<br/><br/>And what they pleased to do with the young Khan<br/>  In Heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;<br/>But doubtless they prefer a fine young man<br/>  To tough old heroes, and can do no less;<br/>And that's the cause no doubt why, if we scan<br/>  A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,<br/>For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,<br/>You'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.<br/><br/>Your houris also have a natural pleasure<br/>  In lopping off your lately married men,<br/>Before the bridal hours have danced their measure<br/>  And the sad, second moon grows dim again,<br/>Or dull Repentance hath had dreary leisure<br/>  To wish him back a bachelor now and then:<br/>And thus your Houri (it may be) disputes<br/>Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.<br/><br/>Thus the young Khan, with Houris in his sight,<br/>  Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,<br/>But bravely rushed on his first heavenly night.<br/>  In short, howe'er _our_ better faith derides,<br/>These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,<br/>  As though there were one Heaven and none besides--<br/>Whereas, if all be true we hear of Heaven<br/>And Hell, there must at least be six or seven.<br/><br/>So fully flashed the phantom on his eyes,<br/>  That when the very lance was in his heart,<br/>He shouted "Allah!" and saw Paradise<br/>  With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,<br/>And bright Eternity without disguise<br/>  On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:--<br/>With Prophets--Houris--Angels--Saints, descried<br/>In one voluptuous blaze,--and then he died,--<br/><br/>But with a heavenly rapture on his face.<br/>  The good old Khan, who long had ceased to see<br/>Houris, or aught except his florid race,<br/>  Who grew like cedars round him gloriously--<br/>When he beheld his latest hero grace<br/>  The earth, which he became like a felled tree,<br/>Paused for a moment from the fight, and cast<br/>A glance on that slain son, his first and last.<br/><br/>The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,<br/>  Stopped as if once more willing to concede<br/>Quarter, in case he bade them not "aroynt!"<br/>  As he before had done. He did not heed<br/>Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,<br/>  And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,<br/>As he looked down upon his children gone,<br/>And felt--though done with life--he was alone.<br/><br/>But 't was a transient tremor:--with a spring<br/>  Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,<br/>As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing<br/>  Against the light wherein she dies: he clung<br/>Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,<br/>  Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;<br/>And throwing back a dim look on his sons,<br/>In one wide wound poured forth his soul at once.<br/><br/>'T is strange enough--the rough, tough soldiers, who<br/>  Spared neither sex nor age in their career<br/>Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,<br/>  And lay before them with his children near,<br/>Touched by the heroism of him they slew,<br/>  Were melted for a moment; though no tear<br/>Flowed from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,<br/>They honoured such determined scorn of Life.<br/><br/>But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,<br/>  Where the chief Pacha calmly held his post:<br/>Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,<br/>  And baffled the assaults of all their host;<br/>At length he condescended to inquire<br/>  If yet the city's rest were won or lost;<br/>And being told the latter, sent a Bey<br/>To answer Ribas' summons to give way.<br/><br/>In the mean time, cross-legged, with great sang-froid,<br/>  Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking<br/>Tobacco on a little carpet;--Troy<br/>  Saw nothing like the scene around;--yet looking<br/>With martial Stoicism, nought seemed to annoy<br/>  His stern philosophy; but gently stroking<br/>His beard, he puffed his pipe's ambrosial gales,<br/>As if he had three lives, as well as tails.<br/><br/>The town was taken--whether he might yield<br/>  Himself or bastion, little mattered now:<br/>His stubborn valour was no future shield.<br/>  Ismail's no more! The Crescent's silver bow<br/>Sunk, and the crimson Cross glared o'er the field,<br/>  But red with no _redeeming_ gore: the glow<br/>Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,<br/>Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.<br/><br/>All that the mind would shrink from of excesses--<br/>  All that the body perpetrates of bad;<br/>All that we read--hear--dream, of man's distresses--<br/>  All that the Devil would do if run stark mad;<br/>All that defies the worst which pen expresses,--<br/>  All by which Hell is peopled, or as sad<br/>As Hell--mere mortals who their power abuse--<br/>Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.<br/><br/>If here and there some transient trait of pity<br/>  Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through<br/>Its bloody bond, and saved, perhaps, some pretty<br/>  Child, or an ag√©d, helpless man or two--<br/>What's this in one annihilated city,<br/>  Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?<br/>Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!<br/>Just ponder what a pious pastime War is.<br/><br/>Think how the joys of reading a Gazette<br/>  Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:<br/>Or if these do not move you, don't forget<br/>  Such doom may be your own in after-times.<br/>Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,<br/>  Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.<br/>Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,<br/>Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.<br/><br/>But still there is unto a patriot nation,<br/>  Which loves so well its country and its King,<br/>A subject of sublimest exultation--<br/>  Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!<br/>Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,<br/>  Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,<br/>Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne--<br/>Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.<br/><br/>But let me put an end unto my theme:<br/>  There was an end of Ismail--hapless town!<br/>Far flashed her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,<br/>  And redly ran his blushing waters down.<br/>The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream<br/>  Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:<br/>Of forty thousand who had manned the wall,<br/>Some hundreds breathed--the rest were silent all!<br/><br/>In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise<br/>  The Russian army upon this occasion,<br/>A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,<br/>  And therefore worthy of commemoration:<br/>The topic's tender, so shall be my phrase--<br/>  Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station<br/>In Winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,<br/>Had made them chaste;--they ravished very little.<br/><br/>Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less<br/>  Might here and there occur some violation<br/>In the other line;--but not to such excess<br/>  As when the French, that dissipated nation,<br/>Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,<br/>  Except cold weather and commiseration;<br/>But all the ladies, save some twenty score,<br/>Were almost as much virgins as before.<br/><br/>Some odd mistakes, too, happened in the dark,<br/>  Which showed a want of lanterns, or of taste--<br/>Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark<br/>  Their friends from foes,--besides such things from haste<br/>Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark<br/>  Of light to save the venerably chaste:<br/>But six old damsels, each of seventy years,<br/>Were all deflowered by different grenadiers.<br/><br/>But on the whole their continence was great;<br/>  So that some disappointment there ensued<br/>To those who had felt the inconvenient state<br/>  Of "single blessedness," and thought it good<br/>(Since it was not their fault, but only fate,<br/>  To bear these crosses) for each waning prude<br/>To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,<br/>Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.<br/><br/>Some voices of the buxom middle-aged<br/>  Were also heard to wonder in the din<br/>(Widows of forty were these birds long caged)<br/>  "Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!"<br/>But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,<br/>  There was small leisure for superfluous sin;<br/>But whether they escaped or no, lies hid<br/>In darkness--I can only hope they did.<br/><br/>Suwarrow now was conqueror--a match<br/>  For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.<br/>While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch<br/>  Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allayed,<br/>With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;<br/>  And here exactly follows what he said:--<br/>"Glory to _God_ and to the Empress!" (_Powers<br/>Eternal! such names mingled!_) "Ismail's ours."<br/><br/>Methinks these are the most tremendous words,<br/>  Since "MENE, MENE, TEKEL," and "UPHARSIN,"<br/>Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.<br/>  Heaven help me! I'm but little of a parson:<br/>What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,<br/>  Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on<br/>The fate of nations;--but this Russ so witty<br/>Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.<br/><br/>He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,<br/>  Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,<br/>Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it--<br/>  For I will teach, if possible, the stones<br/>To rise against Earth's tyrants. Never let it<br/>  Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;--<br/>But ye--our children's children! think how we<br/>Showed _what things were_ before the World was free!<br/><br/>That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:<br/>  And as, in the great joy of your Millennium,<br/>You hardly will believe such things were true<br/>  As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;<br/>But may their very memory perish too!--<br/>  Yet if perchance remembered, still disdain you 'em<br/>More than you scorn the savages of yore,<br/>Who _painted_ their _bare_ limbs, but _not_ with gore.<br/><br/>And when you hear historians talk of thrones,<br/>  And those that sate upon them, let it be<br/>As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,<br/>  And wonder what old world such things could see,<br/>Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,<br/>  The pleasant riddles of futurity--<br/>Guessing at what shall happily be hid,<br/>As the real purpose of a pyramid.<br/><br/>Reader! I have kept my word,--at least so far<br/>  As the first Canto promised. You have now<br/>Had sketches of Love--Tempest--Travel--War,--<br/>  All very accurate, you must allow,<br/>And _Epic_, if plain truth should prove no bar;<br/>  For I have drawn much less with a long bow<br/>Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,<br/>But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,<br/><br/>With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.<br/>  What further hath befallen or may befall<br/>The hero of this grand poetic riddle,<br/>  I by and by may tell you, if at all:<br/>But now I choose to break off in the middle,<br/>  Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,<br/>While Juan is sent off with the despatch,<br/>For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.<br/><br/>This special honour was conferred, because<br/>  He had behaved with courage and humanity--<br/>Which last men like, when they have time to pause<br/>  From their ferocities produced by vanity.<br/>His little captive gained him some applause<br/>  For saving her amidst the wild insanity<br/>Of carnage,--and I think he was more glad in her<br/>Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.<br/><br/>The Moslem orphan went with her protector,<br/>  For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all<br/>Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,<br/>  Had perished in the field or by the wall:<br/>Her very place of birth was but a spectre<br/>  Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's call<br/>To prayer was heard no more!--and Juan wept,<br/>And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.<br/><br/>CANTO THE NINTH.<br/><br/>Oh, Wellington!

Though rather spacious,<br/>Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.<br/><br/>Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first<br/>  Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain:<br/>Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,<br/>  As an East Indian sunrise on the main:--<br/>These quenched a moment her Ambition's thirst--<br/>  So Arab deserts drink in Summer's rain:<br/>In vain!--As fall the dews on quenchless sands,<br/>Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!<br/><br/>Her next amusement was more fanciful;<br/>  She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw<br/>Into a Russian couplet rather dull<br/>  The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew:<br/>Her third was feminine enough to annul<br/>  The shudder which runs naturally through<br/>Our veins, when things called Sovereigns think it best<br/>To kill, and Generals turn it into jest.<br/><br/>The two first feelings ran their course complete,<br/>  And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:<br/>The whole court looked immediately most sweet,<br/>  Like flowers well watered after a long drouth:--<br/>But when on the Lieutenant at her feet<br/>  Her Majesty, who liked to gaze on youth<br/>Almost as much as on a new despatch,<br/>Glanced mildly,--all the world was on the watch.<br/><br/>Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,<br/>  When _wroth_--while _pleased_, she was as fine a figure<br/>As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,<br/>  Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.<br/>She could repay each amatory look you lent<br/>  With interest, and, in turn, was wont with rigour<br/>To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount<br/>At sight, nor would permit you to discount.<br/><br/>With her the latter, though at times convenient,<br/>  Was not so necessary; for they tell<br/>That she was handsome, and though fierce _looked_ lenient,<br/>  And always used her favourites too well.<br/>If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,<br/>  Your "fortune" was in a fair way "to swell<br/>A man" (as Giles says); for though she would widow all<br/>Nations, she liked Man as an individual.<br/><br/>What a strange thing is Man! and what a stranger<br/>  Is Woman!

Whether wed,<br/>Or widow--maid--or mother, she can change her<br/>  Mind like the wind: whatever she has said<br/>Or done, is light to what she'll say or do;--<br/>The oldest thing on record, and yet new!<br/><br/>Oh Catherine! (for of all interjections,<br/>  To thee both _oh!_ and _ah!_ belong, of right,<br/>In Love and War) how odd are the connections<br/>  Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!<br/>Just now _yours_ were cut out in different sections:<br/>  _First_ Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;<br/>_Next_ of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch:<br/>And _thirdly_ he who brought you the despatch!<br/><br/>Shakespeare talks of "the herald Mercury<br/>  New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:"<br/>And some such visions crossed her Majesty,<br/>  While her young herald knelt before her still.<br/>'T is very true the hill seemed rather high,<br/>  For a Lieutenant to climb up; but skill<br/>Smoothed even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing,<br/>With Youth and Health all kisses are "Heaven-kissing."<br/><br/>Her Majesty looked down, the youth looked up--<br/>  And so they fell in love;--she with his face,<br/>His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup<br/>  With the first draught intoxicates apace,<br/>A quintessential laudanum or "Black Drop,"<br/>  Which makes one drunk at once, without the base<br/>Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye<br/>In love drinks all Life's fountains (save tears) dry.<br/><br/>He, on the other hand, if not in love,<br/>  Fell into that no less imperious passion,<br/>Self-love--which, when some sort of thing above<br/>  Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,<br/>Or Duchess--Princess--Empress, "deigns to prove"<br/>  ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,<br/>For one especial person out of many,<br/>Make us believe ourselves as good as any.<br/><br/>Besides, he was of that delighted age<br/>  Which makes all female ages equal--when<br/>We don't much care with whom we may engage,<br/>  As bold as Daniel in the lions' den,<br/>So that we can our native sun assuage<br/>  In the next ocean, which may flow just then--<br/>To make a _twilight_ in, just as Sol's heat is<br/>Quenched in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.<br/><br/>And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),<br/>  Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing<br/>Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,<br/>  Because each lover looked a sort of King,<br/>Made up upon an amatory pattern,<br/>  A royal husband in all save the _ring_--<br/>Which, (being the damnedest part of matrimony,)<br/>Seemed taking out the sting to leave the honey:<br/><br/>And when you add to this, her Womanhood<br/>  In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray--<br/>(The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,<br/>  Or better, as the best examples say:<br/>Napoleon's, Mary's (Queen of Scotland), should<br/>  Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;<br/>And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,<br/>Too wise to look through optics black or blue)--<br/><br/>Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,<br/>  Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,<br/>Her preference of a boy to men much bigger<br/>  (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),<br/>Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,<br/>  With other _extras_, which we need not mention,--<br/>All these, or any one of these, explain<br/>Enough to make a stripling very vain.<br/><br/>And that's enough, for Love is vanity,<br/>  Selfish in its beginning as its end,<br/>Except where 't is a mere insanity,<br/>  A maddening spirit which would strive to blend<br/>Itself with Beauty's frail inanity,<br/>  On which the Passion's self seems to depend;<br/>And hence some heathenish philosophers<br/>Make Love the main-spring of the Universe.<br/><br/>Besides Platonic love, besides the love<br/>  Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving<br/>Of faithful pairs--(I needs must rhyme with dove,<br/>  That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving<br/>'Gainst reason--Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove<br/>  With rhyme, but always leant less to improving<br/>The sound than sense)--besides all these pretences<br/>To Love, there are those things which words name senses;<br/><br/>Those movements, those improvements in our bodies<br/>  Which make all bodies anxious to get out<br/>Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,<br/>  For such all women are at first no doubt.<br/>How beautiful that moment! and how odd is<br/>  That fever which precedes the languid rout<br/>Of our sensations! What a curious way<br/>The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!<br/><br/>The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,<br/>  To end or to begin with; the next grand<br/>Is that which may be christened love canonical,<br/>  Because the clergy take the thing in hand;<br/>The third sort to be noted in our chronicle<br/>  As flourishing in every Christian land,<br/>Is when chaste matrons to their other ties<br/>Add what may be called _marriage in disguise_.<br/><br/>Well, we won't analyse--our story must<br/>  Tell for itself: the Sovereign was smitten,<br/>Juan much flattered by her love, or lust;--<br/>  I cannot stop to alter words once written,<br/>And the _two_ are so mixed with human dust,<br/>  That he who _names one_, both perchance may hit on:<br/>But in such matters Russia's mighty Empress<br/>Behaved no better than a common sempstress.<br/><br/>The whole court melted into one wide whisper,<br/>  And all lips were applied unto all ears!<br/>The elder ladies' wrinkles curled much crisper<br/>  As they beheld; the younger cast some leers<br/>On one another, and each lovely lisper<br/>  Smiled as she talked the matter o'er; but tears<br/>Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye<br/>Of all the standing army who stood by.<br/><br/>All the ambassadors of all the powers<br/>  Inquired, Who was this very new young man,<br/>Who promised to be great in some few hours?<br/>  Which is full soon (though Life is but a span).<br/>Already they beheld the silver showers<br/>  Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,<br/>Upon his cabinet, besides the presents<br/>Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.<br/><br/>Catherine was generous,--all such ladies are:<br/>  Love--that great opener of the heart and all<br/>The ways that lead there, be they near or far,<br/>  Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,--<br/>Love--(though she had a cursed taste for War,<br/>  And was not the best wife unless we call<br/>Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better<br/>That one should die--than two drag on the fetter)--<br/><br/>Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,<br/>  Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,<br/>Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,<br/>  If History, the grand liar, ever saith<br/>The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,<br/>  Because she put a favourite to death,<br/>Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,<br/>And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.<br/><br/>But when the lev√©e rose, and all was bustle<br/>  In the dissolving circle, all the nations'<br/>Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle<br/>  Round the young man with their congratulations.<br/>Also the softer silks were heard to rustle<br/>  Of gentle dames, among whose recreations<br/>It is to speculate on handsome faces,<br/>Especially when such lead to high places.<br/><br/>Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,<br/>  A general object of attention, made<br/>His answers with a very graceful bow,<br/>  As if born for the ministerial trade.<br/>Though modest, on his unembarrassed brow<br/>  Nature had written "Gentleman!" He said<br/>Little, but to the purpose; and his manner<br/>Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.<br/><br/>An order from her Majesty consigned<br/>  Our young Lieutenant to the genial care<br/>Of those in office: all the world looked kind,<br/>  (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,<br/>Which Youth would not act ill to keep in mind,)<br/>  As also did Miss Protasoff then there,<br/>Named from her mystic office "l'Eprouveuse,"<br/>A term inexplicable to the Muse.<br/><br/>With _her_ then, as in humble duty bound,<br/>  Juan retired,--and so will I, until<br/>My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.<br/>  We have just lit on a "heaven-kissing hill,"<br/>So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,<br/>  And all my fancies whirling like a mill;<br/>Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,<br/>To take a quiet ride in some green lane.<br/><br/>CANTO THE TENTH.<br/><br/>When Newton saw an apple fall, he found<br/>  In that slight startle from his contemplation--<br/>'T is _said_ (for I'll not answer above ground<br/>  For any sage's creed or calculation)--<br/>A mode of proving that the Earth turned round<br/>  In a most natural whirl, called "gravitation;"<br/>And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,<br/>Since Adam--with a fall--or with an apple.<br/><br/>Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,<br/>  If this be true; for we must deem the mode<br/>In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose<br/>  Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,<br/>A thing to counterbalance human woes:<br/>  For ever since immortal man hath glowed<br/>With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon<br/>Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.<br/><br/>And wherefore this exordium?--Why, just now,<br/>  In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,<br/>My bosom underwent a glorious glow,<br/>  And my internal spirit cut a caper:<br/>And though so much inferior, as I know,<br/>  To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,<br/>Discover stars, and sail in the wind's eye,<br/>I wish to do as much by Poesy.<br/><br/>In the wind's eye I have sailed, and sail; but for<br/>  The stars, I own my telescope is dim;<br/>But at the least I have shunned the common shore,<br/>  And leaving land far out of sight, would skim<br/>The Ocean of Eternity: the roar<br/>  Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,<br/>But _still_ sea-worthy skiff; and she may float<br/>Where ships have foundered, as doth many a boat.<br/><br/>We left our hero, Juan, in the _bloom_<br/>  Of favouritism, but not yet in the _blush;--_<br/>And far be it from my _Muses_ to presume<br/>  (For I have more than one Muse at a push),<br/>To follow him beyond the drawing-room:<br/>  It is enough that Fortune found him flush<br/>Of Youth, and Vigour, Beauty, and those things<br/>Which for an instant clip Enjoyment's wings.<br/><br/>But soon they grow again and leave their nest.<br/>  "Oh!" saith the Psalmist, "that I had a dove's<br/>Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!"<br/>  And who that recollects young years and loves,--<br/>Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,<br/>  And palsied Fancy, which no longer roves<br/>Beyond its dimmed eye's sphere,--but would much rather<br/>Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?<br/><br/>But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,<br/>  Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,<br/>So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,<br/>  Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!<br/>Such difference doth a few months make. You'd think<br/>  Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;<br/>No more it doth--its ploughs but change their boys,<br/>Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.<br/><br/>But coughs will come when sighs depart--and now<br/>  And then before sighs cease; for oft the one<br/>Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow<br/>  Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the Sun<br/>Of Life reached ten o'clock: and while a glow,<br/>  Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,<br/>O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,<br/>Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!--<br/><br/>But Juan was not meant to die so soon:--<br/>  We left him in the focus of such glory<br/>As may be won by favour of the moon<br/>  Or ladies' fancies--rather transitory<br/>Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,<br/>  Because December, with his breath so hoary,<br/>Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,<br/>To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.<br/><br/>Besides, he had some qualities which fix<br/>  Middle-aged ladies even more than young:<br/>The former know what's what; while new-fledged chicks<br/>  Know little more of Love than what is sung<br/>In rhymes, or dreamt (for Fancy will play tricks)<br/>  In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.<br/>Some reckon women by their suns or years,<br/>I rather think the Moon should date the dears.<br/><br/>And why? because she's changeable and chaste:<br/>  I know no other reason, whatsoe'er<br/>Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,<br/>  May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,<br/>Nor flattering to "their temper or their taste,"<br/>  As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:<br/>However, I forgive him, and I trust<br/>He will forgive himself;--if not, I must.<br/><br/>Old enemies who have become new friends<br/>  Should so continue--'t is a point of honour;<br/>And I know nothing which could make amends<br/>  For a return to Hatred: I would shun her<br/>Like garlic, howsoever she extends<br/>  Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.<br/>Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes--<br/>Converted foes should scorn to join with those.<br/><br/>This were the worst desertion:--renegadoes,<br/>  Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,<br/>Would scarcely join again the "reformadoes,"<br/>  Whom he forsook to fill the Laureate's sty;<br/>And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,<br/>  Whether in Caledon or Italy,<br/>Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize<br/>To pain, the moment when you cease to please.<br/><br/>The lawyer and the critic but behold<br/>  The baser sides of literature and life,<br/>And nought remains unseen, but much untold,<br/>  By those who scour those double vales of strife.<br/>While common men grow ignorantly old,<br/>  The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,<br/>Dissecting the whole inside of a question,<br/>And with it all the process of digestion.<br/><br/>A legal broom's a moral chimney-sweeper,<br/>  And that's the reason he himself's so dirty;<br/>The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper<br/>  Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he<br/>Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,<br/>  At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,<br/>In all their habits;--not so _you_, I own;<br/>As C√¶sar wore his robe you wear your gown.<br/><br/>And all our little feuds, at least all _mine_,<br/>  Dear Jeffrey, once my most redoubted foe<br/>(As far as rhyme and criticism combine<br/>  To make such puppets of us things below),<br/>Are over: Here's a health to "Auld Lang Syne!"<br/>  I do not know you, and may never know<br/>Your face--but you have acted on the whole<br/>Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.<br/><br/>And when I use the phrase of "Auld Lang Syne!"<br/>  'T is not addressed to you--the more's the pity<br/>For me, for I would rather take my wine<br/>  With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city:<br/>But somehow--it may seem a schoolboy's whine,<br/>  And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,<br/>But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred<br/>A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,--<br/><br/>As "Auld Lang Syne" brings Scotland, one and all,<br/>  Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,<br/>The Dee--the Don--Balgounie's brig's _black wall_--<br/>  All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams<br/>Of what I _then dreamt_, clothed in their own pall,--<br/>  Like Banquo's offspring--floating past me seems<br/>My childhood, in this childishness of mine:--<br/>I care not--'t is a glimpse of "_Auld Lang Syne_."<br/><br/>And though, as you remember, in a fit<br/>  Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,<br/>I railed at Scots to show my wrath and wit,<br/>  Which must be owned was sensitive and surly,<br/>Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,<br/>  They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:<br/>I "_scotched_ not killed" the Scotchman in my blood,<br/>And love the land of "mountain and of flood."<br/><br/>Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,--<br/>  For both are much the same, since what men think<br/>Exists when the once thinkers are less real<br/>  Than what they thought, for Mind can never sink,<br/>And 'gainst the Body makes a strong appeal;<br/>  And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink<br/>Of what is called Eternity to stare,<br/>And know no more of what is _here_, than _there_;--<br/><br/>Don Juan grew a very polished Russian--<br/>  _How_ we won't mention, _why_ we need not say:<br/>Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion<br/>  Of any slight temptation in their way;<br/>But _his_ just now were spread as is a cushion<br/>  Smoothed for a Monarch's seat of honour: gay<br/>Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,<br/>Made ice seem Paradise, and winter sunny.<br/><br/>The favour of the Empress was agreeable;<br/>  And though the duty waxed a little hard,<br/>Young people at his time of life should be able<br/>  To come off handsomely in that regard.<br/>He was now growing up like a green tree, able<br/>  For Love, War, or Ambition, which reward<br/>Their luckier votaries, till old Age's tedium<br/>Make some prefer the circulating medium.<br/><br/>About this time, as might have been anticipated,<br/>  Seduced by Youth and dangerous examples,<br/>Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;<br/>  Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples<br/>On our fresh feelings, but--as being participated<br/>  With all kinds of incorrigible samples<br/>Of frail humanity--must make us selfish,<br/>And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.<br/><br/>This we pass over. We will also pass<br/>  The usual progress of intrigues between<br/>Unequal matches, such as are, alas!<br/>  A young Lieutenant's with a _not old_ Queen,<br/>But one who is not so youthful as she was<br/>  In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.<br/>Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,<br/>And wrinkles, the d----d democrats! won't flatter.<br/><br/>And Death, the Sovereign's Sovereign, though the great<br/>  Gracchus of all mortality, who levels,<br/>With his _Agrarian_ laws, the high estate<br/>  Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,<br/>To one small grass-grown patch (which must await<br/>  Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils<br/>Who never had a foot of land till now,--<br/>Death's a reformer--all men must allow.<br/><br/>He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry<br/>  Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,<br/>In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry--<br/>  Which (though I hate to say a thing that's bitter)<br/>Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,<br/>  Through all the "purple and fine linen," fitter<br/>For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot--<br/>And neutralise her outward show of scarlet.<br/><br/>And this same state we won't describe: we would<br/>  Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection:<br/>But getting nigh grim Dante's "obscure wood,"<br/>  That horrid equinox, that hateful section<br/>Of human years--that half-way house--that rude<br/>  Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection<br/>Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier<br/>Of Age, and looking back to Youth, give _one_ tear;--<br/><br/>I won't describe,--that is, if I can help<br/>  Description; and I won't reflect,--that is,<br/>If I can stave off thought, which--as a whelp<br/>  Clings to its teat--sticks to me through the abyss<br/>Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp<br/>  Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss<br/>Drains its first draught of lips:--but, as I said,<br/>I _won't_ philosophise, and _will_ be read.<br/><br/>Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,--<br/>  A thing which happens rarely: this he owed<br/>Much to his youth, and much to his reported<br/>  Valour; much also to the blood he showed,<br/>Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,<br/>  Which set the beauty off in which he glowed,<br/>As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most<br/>He owed to an old woman and his post.<br/><br/>He wrote to Spain;--and all his near relations,<br/>  Perceiving he was in a handsome way<br/>Of getting on himself, and finding stations<br/>  For cousins also, answered the same day.<br/>Several prepared themselves for emigrations;<br/>  And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,<br/>That with the addition of a slight pelisse,<br/>Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.<br/><br/>His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,<br/>  That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,<br/>Where his assets were waxing rather few,<br/>  He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--<br/>Replied, "that she was glad to see him through<br/>  Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;<br/>As the sole sign of Man's being in his senses<br/>Is--learning to reduce his past expenses.<br/><br/>"She also recommended him to God,<br/>  And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,<br/>Warned him against Greek worship, which looks odd<br/>  In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother<br/>_Outward_ dislike, which don't look well abroad;<br/>  Informed him that he had a little brother<br/>Born in a second wedlock; and above<br/>All, praised the Empress's _maternal_ love.<br/><br/>"She could not too much give her approbation<br/>  Unto an Empress, who preferred young men<br/>Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation<br/>  And climate, stopped all scandal (now and then);--<br/>At home it might have given her some vexation;<br/>  But where thermometers sink down to ten,<br/>Or five, or one, or zero, she could never<br/>Believe that Virtue thawed before the river."<br/><br/>Oh for a _forty-parson power_--to chant<br/>  Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn<br/>Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,<br/>  Not practise! Oh for trump of Cherubim!<br/>Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,<br/>  Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,<br/>Drew quiet consolation through its hint,<br/>When she no more could read the pious print.<br/><br/>She was no Hypocrite at least, poor soul,<br/>  But went to heaven in as sincere a way<br/>As anybody on the elected roll,<br/>  Which portions out upon the Judgment Day<br/>Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of Doomsday scroll,<br/>  Such as the conqueror William did repay<br/>His knights with, lotting others' properties<br/>Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.<br/><br/>I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,<br/>  Erneis, Radulphus--eight-and-forty manors<br/>(If that my memory doth not greatly err)<br/>  Were _their_ reward for following Billy's banners:<br/>And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair<br/>  To strip the Saxons of their _hydes_ like tanners;<br/>Yet as they founded churches with the produce,<br/>You'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.<br/><br/>The gentle Juan flourished, though at times<br/>  He felt like other plants called sensitive,<br/>Which shrink from touch, as Monarchs do from rhymes,<br/>  Save such as Southey can afford to give.<br/>Perhaps he longed in bitter frosts for climes<br/>  In which the Neva's ice would cease to live<br/>Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,<br/>In Royalty's vast arms he sighed for Beauty:<br/><br/>Perhaps--but, sans perhaps, we need not seek<br/>  For causes young or old: the canker-worm<br/>Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,<br/>  As well as further drain the withered form:<br/>Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week<br/>  His bills in, and however we may storm,<br/>They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,<br/>The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.<br/><br/>I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:<br/>  The Empress was alarmed, and her physician<br/>(The same who physicked Peter) found the tick<br/>  Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition<br/>Which augured of the dead, however _quick_<br/>  Itself, and showed a feverish disposition;<br/>At which the whole Court was extremely troubled,<br/>The Sovereign shocked, and all his medicines doubled.<br/><br/>Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:<br/>  Some said he had been poisoned by Potemkin;<br/>Others talked learnedly of certain tumours,<br/>  Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;<br/>Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,<br/>  Which with the blood too readily will claim kin:<br/>Others again were ready to maintain,<br/>"'T was only the fatigue of last campaign."<br/><br/>But here is one prescription out of many:<br/>  "_Sodae sulphat_.  ívj.  ífs. _Mannae optim._<br/>_Aq. fervent._ f. ‚Ñ• ifs.  íij. _tinct.

This opinion<br/>Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,<br/>  Who did not like at first to lose her minion:<br/>But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,<br/>  And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,<br/>She then resolved to send him on a mission,<br/>But in a style becoming his condition.<br/><br/>There was just then a kind of a discussion,<br/>  A sort of treaty or negotiation,<br/>Between the British cabinet and Russian,<br/>  Maintained with all the due prevarication<br/>With which great states such things are apt to push on;<br/>  Something about the Baltic's navigation,<br/>Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,<br/>Which Britons deem their _uti possidetis_.<br/><br/>So Catherine, who had a handsome way<br/>  Of fitting out her favourites, conferred<br/>This secret charge on Juan, to display<br/>  At once her royal splendour, and reward<br/>His services. He kissed hands the next day,<br/>  Received instructions how to play his card,<br/>Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,<br/>Which showed what great discernment was the donor's.<br/><br/>But she was lucky, and luck's all. Your Queens<br/>  Are generally prosperous in reigning--<br/>Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means:--<br/>  But to continue--though her years were waning,<br/>Her climacteric teased her like her teens;<br/>  And though her dignity brooked no complaining,<br/>So much did Juan's setting off distress her,<br/>She could not find at first a fit successor.<br/><br/>But Time, the comforter, will come at last;<br/>  And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number<br/>Of candidates requesting to be placed,<br/>  Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--<br/>Not that she meant to fix again in haste,<br/>  Nor did she find the quantity encumber,<br/>But always choosing with deliberation,<br/>Kept the place open for their emulation.<br/><br/>While this high post of honour's in abeyance,<br/>  For one or two days, reader, we request<br/>You'll mount with our young hero the conveyance<br/>  Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best<br/>Barouche, which had the glory to display once<br/>  The fair Czarina's autocratic crest,<br/>When, a new Iphigene, she went to Tauris,<br/>Was given to her favourite, and now _bore his_.<br/><br/>A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,<br/>  All private favourites of Don Juan;--for<br/>(Let deeper sages the true cause determine)<br/>  He had a kind of inclination, or<br/>Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,<br/>  Live animals: an old maid of threescore<br/>For cats and birds more penchant ne'er displayed,<br/>Although he was not old, nor even a maid;--<br/><br/>The animals aforesaid occupied<br/>  Their station: there were valets, secretaries,<br/>In other vehicles; but at his side<br/>  Sat little Leila, who survived the parries<br/>He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres in the wide<br/>  Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies<br/>Her note, she don't forget the infant girl<br/>Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl.<br/><br/>Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,<br/>  And with that gentle, serious character,<br/>As rare in living beings as a fossile<br/>  Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, "grand Cuvier!"<br/>Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle<br/>  With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:<br/>But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore<br/>Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.<br/><br/>Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as<br/>  Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.--I<br/>cannot tell exactly what it was;<br/>  He was not yet quite old enough to prove<br/>Parental feelings, and the other class,<br/>  Called brotherly affection, could not move<br/>His bosom,--for he never had a sister:<br/>Ah! if he had--how much he would have missed her!<br/><br/>And still less was it sensual; for besides<br/>  That he was not an ancient debauchee,<br/>(Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,<br/>  As acids rouse a dormant alkali,)<br/>Although (_'t will_ happen as our planet guides)<br/>  His youth was not the chastest that might be,<br/>There was the purest Platonism at bottom<br/>Of all his feelings--only he forgot 'em.<br/><br/>Just now there was no peril of temptation;<br/>  He loved the infant orphan he had saved,<br/>As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;<br/>  His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved<br/>Owing to him;--as also her salvation<br/>  Through his means and the Church's might be paved.<br/>But one thing's odd, which here must be inserted,<br/>The little Turk refused to be converted.<br/><br/>'T was strange enough she should retain the impression<br/>  Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;<br/>But though three Bishops told her the transgression,<br/>  She showed a great dislike to holy water;<br/>She also had no passion for confession;<br/>  Perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,<br/>Whate'er the cause, the Church made little of it--<br/>She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.<br/><br/>In fact, the only Christian she could bear<br/>  Was Juan; whom she seemed to have selected<br/>In place of what her home and friends once _were_.<br/>  _He_ naturally loved what he protected:<br/>And thus they formed a rather curious pair,<br/>  A guardian green in years, a ward connected<br/>In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;<br/>And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.<br/><br/>They journeyed on through Poland and through Warsaw,<br/>  Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:<br/>Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw<br/>  Which gave her dukes the graceless name of "Biron."<br/>'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,<br/>  Who marched to Moscow, led by Fame, the Siren!<br/>To lose by one month's frost some twenty years<br/>Of conquest, and his guard of Grenadiers.<br/><br/>Let this not seem an anti-climax:--"Oh!<br/>  My guard! my old guard!" exclaimed that god of clay.<br/>Think of the Thunderer's falling down below<br/>  Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!<br/>Alas! that glory should be chilled by snow!<br/>  But should we wish to warm us on our way<br/>Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name<br/>Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.<br/><br/>From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,<br/>  And K√∂nigsberg, the capital, whose vaunt,<br/>Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,<br/>  Has lately been the great Professor Kant.<br/>Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper<br/>  About philosophy, pursued his jaunt<br/>To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions<br/>Have princes who spur more than their postilions.<br/><br/>And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,<br/>  Until he reached the castellated Rhine:--<br/>Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike<br/>  All phantasies, not even excepting mine!<br/>A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,<br/>  Make my soul pass the equinoctial line<br/>Between the present and past worlds, and hover<br/>Upon their airy confines, half-seas-over.<br/><br/>But Juan posted on through Mannheim, Bonn,<br/>  Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre<br/>Of the good feudal times for ever gone,<br/>  On which I have not time just now to lecture.<br/>From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,<br/>  A city which presents to the inspector<br/>Eleven thousand maiden heads of bone.<br/>The greatest number flesh hath ever known.<br/><br/>From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,<br/>  That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,<br/>Where juniper expresses its best juice,<br/>  The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.<br/>Senates and sages have condemned its use--<br/>  But to deny the mob a cordial, which is<br/>Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,<br/>Good government has left them, seems but cruel.<br/><br/>Here he embarked, and with a flowing sail<br/>  Went bounding for the Island of the free,<br/>Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;<br/>  High dashed the spray, the bows dipped in the sea,<br/>And sea-sick passengers turned somewhat pale;<br/>  But Juan, seasoned, as he well might be,<br/>By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs<br/>Which passed, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.<br/><br/>At length they rose, like a white wall along<br/>  The blue sea's border; and Don Juan felt--<br/>What even young strangers feel a little strong<br/>  At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt--A<br/>kind of pride that he should be among<br/>  Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt<br/>Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,<br/>And made the very billows pay them toll.<br/><br/>I've no great cause to love that spot of earth,<br/>  Which holds what _might have been_ the noblest nation;<br/>But though I owe it little but my birth,<br/>  I feel a mixed regret and veneration<br/>For its decaying fame and former worth.<br/>  Seven years (the usual term of transportation)<br/>Of absence lay one's old resentments level,<br/>When a man's country's going to the devil.<br/><br/>Alas! could she but fully, truly, know<br/>  How her great name is now throughout abhorred;<br/>How eager all the Earth is for the blow<br/>  Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;<br/>How all the nations deem her their worst foe,<br/>  That worse than _worst of foes_, the once adored<br/>False friend, who held out Freedom to Mankind,<br/>And now would chain them--to the very _mind_;--<br/><br/>Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,<br/>  Who is but first of slaves? The nations are<br/>In prison,--but the gaoler, what is he?<br/>  No less a victim to the bolt and bar.<br/>Is the poor privilege to turn the key<br/>  Upon the captive, Freedom? He's as far<br/>From the enjoyment of the earth and air<br/>Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.<br/><br/>Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,<br/>  Thy cliffs, _dear_ Dover! harbour, and hotel;<br/>Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;<br/>  Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;<br/>Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties<br/>  To those who upon land or water dwell;<br/>And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,<br/>Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.<br/><br/>Juan, though careless, young, and _magnifique_,<br/>  And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,<br/>Who did not limit much his bills per week,<br/>  Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it,--<br/>(His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,<br/>  Before him summed the awful scroll and read it):<br/>But, doubtless, as the air--though seldom sunny--<br/>Is free, the respiration's worth the money.<br/><br/>On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!<br/>  Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;<br/>Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!<br/>  Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle<br/>Along the road, as if they went to bury<br/>  Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle<br/>With "schnapps"--sad dogs! whom "Hundsfot," or "Verflucter,"<br/>Affect no more than lightning a conductor.<br/><br/>Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,<br/>  Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,<br/>As going at full speed--no matter where its<br/>  Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,<br/>And merely for the sake of its own merits;<br/>  For the less cause there is for all this flurry,<br/>The greater is the pleasure in arriving<br/>At the great _end_ of travel--which is driving.<br/><br/>They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;<br/>  Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,<br/>Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,<br/>  In the same quaint, uninterested tone:--<br/>There's glory again for you, gentle reader! All<br/>  Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,<br/>Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias,<br/>Which form that bitter draught, the human species.<br/><br/>The effect on Juan was of course sublime:<br/>  He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw<br/>That casque, which never stooped except to Time.<br/>  Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,<br/>Who died in the then great attempt to climb<br/>  O'er Kings, who _now_ at least _must talk_ of Law<br/>Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,<br/>And asked why such a structure had been raised:<br/><br/>And being told it was "God's House," she said<br/>  He was well lodged, but only wondered how<br/>He suffered Infidels in his homestead,<br/>  The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low<br/>His holy temples in the lands which bred<br/>  The True Believers;--and her infant brow<br/>Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign<br/>A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.<br/><br/>On! on! through meadows, managed like a garden,<br/>  A paradise of hops and high production;<br/>For, after years of travel by a bard in<br/>  Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,<br/>A green field is a sight which makes him pardon<br/>  The absence of that more sublime construction,<br/>Which mixes up vines--olives--precipices--<br/>Glaciers--volcanoes--oranges and ices.<br/><br/>And when I think upon a pot of beer----<br/>  But I won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!<br/>As the smart boys spurred fast in their career,<br/>  Juan admired these highways of free millions--<br/>A country in all senses the most dear<br/>  To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,<br/>Who "kick against the pricks" just at this juncture,<br/>And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.<br/><br/>What a delightful thing's a turnpike road!<br/>  So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving<br/>The Earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad<br/>  Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.<br/>Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god<br/>  Had told his son to satisfy his craving<br/>With the York mail;--but onward as we roll,<br/>_Surgit amari aliquid_--the toll!<br/><br/>Alas! how deeply painful is all payment!<br/>  Take lives--take wives--take aught except men's purses:<br/>As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,<br/>  Such is the shortest way to general curses.<br/>They hate a murderer much less than a claimant<br/>  On that sweet ore which everybody nurses.--<br/>Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,<br/>But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket:<br/><br/>So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken<br/>  To your instructor. Juan now was borne,<br/>Just as the day began to wane and darken,<br/>  O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn<br/>Toward the great city.--Ye who have a spark in<br/>  Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn<br/>According as you take things well or ill;--<br/>Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!<br/><br/>The Sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from<br/>  A half-unquenched volcano, o'er a space<br/>Which well beseemed the "Devil's drawing-room,"<br/>  As some have qualified that wondrous place:<br/>But Juan felt, though not approaching _Home_,<br/>  As one who, though he were not of the race,<br/>Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,<br/>Who butchered half the earth, and bullied t' other.<br/><br/>A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,<br/>  Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye<br/>Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping<br/>  In sight, then lost amidst the forestry<br/>Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping<br/>  On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;<br/>A huge, dun Cupola, like a foolscap crown<br/>On a fool's head--and there is London Town!<br/><br/>But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke<br/>  Appeared to him but as the magic vapour<br/>Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke<br/>  The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):<br/>The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke<br/>  Are bowed, and put the Sun out like a taper,<br/>Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,<br/>Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.<br/><br/>He paused--and so will I; as doth a crew<br/>  Before they give their broadside. By and by,<br/>My gentle countrymen, we will renew<br/>  Our old acquaintance; and at least I'll try<br/>To tell you truths _you_ will not take as true,<br/>  Because they are so;--a male Mrs. Fry,<br/>With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,<br/>And brush a web or two from off the walls.<br/><br/>Oh Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why<br/>  Preach to _poor_ rogues? And wherefore not begin<br/>With Carlton, or with other houses? Try<br/>  Your hand at hardened and imperial Sin.<br/>To mend the People's an absurdity,<br/>  A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,<br/>Unless you make their betters better:--Fie!<br/>I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.<br/><br/>Teach _them_ the decencies of good threescore;<br/>  Cure _them_ of tours, hussar and highland dresses;<br/>Tell _them_ that youth once gone returns no more,<br/>  That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;<br/>Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,<br/>  Too dull even for the dullest of excesses--<br/>The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,<br/>A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.<br/><br/>Tell them, though it may be, perhaps, too late--<br/>  On Life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated--<br/>To set up vain pretence of being _great_,<br/>  'T is not so to be _good_; and, be it stated,<br/>The worthiest kings have ever loved least state:<br/>  And tell them--But you won't, and I have prated<br/>Just now enough; but, by and by, I'll prattle<br/>Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.<br/><br/>CANTO THE ELEVENTH.<br/><br/>WHEN Bishop Berkeley said "there was no matter,"<br/>  And proved it--'t was no matter what he said:<br/>They say his system 't is in vain to batter,<br/>  Too subtle for the airiest human head;<br/>And yet who can believe it? I would shatter<br/>  Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,<br/>Or adamant, to find the World a spirit,<br/>And wear my head, denying that I wear it.<br/><br/>What a sublime discovery 't was to make the<br/>  Universe universal egotism,<br/>That all's ideal--_all ourselves!_--I'll stake the<br/>  World (be it what you will) that _that's_ no schism.<br/>Oh Doubt!--if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee,<br/>  But which I doubt extremely--thou sole prism<br/>Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!<br/>Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.<br/><br/>For ever and anon comes Indigestion<br/>  (Not the most "dainty Ariel"), and perplexes<br/>Our soarings with another sort of question:<br/>  And that which after all my spirit vexes,<br/>Is, that I find no spot where Man can rest eye on,<br/>  Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,<br/>Of Beings, Stars, and this unriddled wonder,<br/>The World, which at the worst's a _glorious_ blunder--<br/><br/>If it be chance--or, if it be according<br/>  To the old text, still better:--lest it should<br/>Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,<br/>  As several people think such hazards rude.<br/>They're right; our days are too brief for affording<br/>  Space to dispute what _no one_ ever could<br/>Decide, and _everybody one day_ will<br/>Know very clearly--or at least lie still.<br/><br/>And therefore will I leave off metaphysical<br/>  Discussion, which is neither here nor there:<br/>If I agree that what is, is; then this I call<br/>  Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;<br/>The truth is, I've grown lately rather phthisical:<br/>  I don't know what the reason is--the air<br/>Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks<br/>Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.<br/><br/>The first attack at once proved the Divinity<br/>  (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);<br/>The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;<br/>  The third, the usual Origin of Evil;<br/>The fourth at once established the whole Trinity<br/>  On so uncontrovertible a level,<br/>That I devoutly wished the three were four--<br/>On purpose to believe so much the more.<br/><br/>To our theme.--The man who has stood on the Acropolis,<br/>  And looked down over Attica; or he<br/>Who has sailed where picturesque Constantinople is,<br/>  Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea<br/>In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,<br/>  Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,<br/>May not think much of London's first appearance--<br/>But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence!<br/><br/>Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;<br/>  Sunset the time, the place the same declivity<br/>Which looks along that vale of Good and Ill<br/>  Where London streets ferment in full activity,<br/>While everything around was calm and still,<br/>  Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he<br/>Heard,--and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum<br/>Of cities, that boil over with their scum:--<br/><br/>I say, Don Juan, wrapped in contemplation,<br/>  Walked on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,<br/>And lost in wonder of so great a nation,<br/>  Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.<br/>"And here," he cried, "is Freedom's chosen station;<br/>  Here peals the People's voice, nor can entomb it<br/>Racks--prisons--inquisitions; Resurrection<br/>Awaits it, each new meeting or election.<br/><br/>"Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay<br/>  But what they please; and if that things be dear,<br/>'T is only that they love to throw away<br/>  Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.<br/>Here laws are all inviolate--none lay<br/>  Traps for the traveller--every highway's clear--<br/>Here"--he was interrupted by a knife,<br/>With--"Damn your eyes! your money or your life!"--<br/><br/>These free-born sounds proceeded from four pads<br/>  In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter<br/>Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,<br/>  Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,<br/>In which the heedless gentleman who gads<br/>  Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,<br/>May find himself within that isle of riches<br/>Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.<br/><br/>Juan, who did not understand a word<br/>  Of English, save their shibboleth, "God damn!"<br/>And even that he had so rarely heard,<br/>  He sometimes thought 't was only their "SalƒÅm,"<br/>Or "God be with you!"--and 't is not absurd<br/>  To think so,--for half English as I am<br/>(To my misfortune), never can I say<br/>I heard them wish "God with you," save that way;--<br/><br/>Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,<br/>  And being somewhat choleric and sudden,<br/>Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,<br/>  And fired it into one assailant's pudding--<br/>Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,<br/>  And roared out, as he writhed his native mud in,<br/>Unto his nearest follower or henchman,<br/>"Oh Jack! I'm floored by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!"<br/><br/>On which Jack and his train set off at speed,<br/>  And Juan's suite, late scattered at a distance,<br/>Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,<br/>  And offering, as usual, late assistance.<br/>Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed<br/>  As if his veins would pour out his existence,<br/>Stood calling out for bandages and lint,<br/>And wished he had been less hasty with his flint.<br/><br/>"Perhaps," thought he, "it is the country's wont<br/>  To welcome foreigners in this way: now<br/>I recollect some innkeepers who don't<br/>  Differ, except in robbing with a bow,<br/>In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front--<br/>  But what is to be done? I can't allow<br/>The fellow to lie groaning on the road:<br/>So take him up--I'll help you with the load."<br/><br/>But ere they could perform this pious duty,<br/>  The dying man cried, "Hold! I've got my gruel!<br/>Oh! for a glass of _max_! We've missed our booty;<br/>  Let me die where I am!" And as the fuel<br/>Of Life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty<br/>  The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill<br/>His breath,--he from his swelling throat untied<br/>A kerchief, crying, "Give Sal that!"--and died.<br/><br/>The cravat stained with bloody drops fell down<br/>  Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell<br/>Exactly why it was before him thrown,<br/>  Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.<br/>Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,<br/>  A thorough varmint, and a _real_ swell,<br/>Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,<br/>His pockets first and then his body riddled.<br/><br/>Don Juan, having done the best he could<br/>  In all the circumstances of the case,<br/>As soon as "Crowner's quest" allowed, pursued<br/>  His travels to the capital apace;--<br/>Esteeming it a little hard he should<br/>  In twelve hours' time, and very little space,<br/>Have been obliged to slay a free-born native<br/>In self-defence: this made him meditative.<br/><br/>He from the world had cut off a great man,<br/>  Who in his time had made heroic bustle.<br/>Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,<br/>  Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?<br/>Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow-street's ban)<br/>  On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?<br/>Who on a lark with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),<br/>So prime--so swell--so nutty--and so knowing?<br/><br/>But Tom's no more--and so no more of Tom.<br/>  Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is<br/>Not long before the most of them go home.<br/>  Hail! Thamis, hail! Upon thy verge it is<br/>That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum<br/>  In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,<br/>Through Kennington and all the other "tons,"<br/>Which make us wish ourselves in town at once;--<br/><br/>Through Groves, so called as being void of trees,<br/>  (Like _lucus_ from _no_ light); through prospects named<br/>Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,<br/>  Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed<br/>Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,<br/>  With "To be let," upon their doors proclaimed;<br/>Through "Rows" most modestly called "Paradise,"<br/>Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;--<br/><br/>Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl<br/>  Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;<br/>Here taverns wooing to a pint of "purl,"<br/>  There mails fast flying off like a delusion;<br/>There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl<br/>  In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion<br/>Slowly distilled into the glimmering glass<br/>(For in those days we had not got to gas--);<br/><br/>Through this, and much, and more, is the approach<br/>  Of travellers to mighty Babylon:<br/>Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,<br/>  With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.<br/>I could say more, but do not choose to encroach<br/>  Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The Sun<br/>Had set some time, and night was on the ridge<br/>Of twilight, as the party crossed the bridge.<br/><br/>That's rather fine, the gentle sound of Thamis--<br/>  Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream--<br/>Though hardly heard through multifarious "damme's:"<br/>  The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,<br/>The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where Fame is<br/>  A spectral resident--whose pallid beam<br/>In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile--<br/>Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.<br/><br/>The Druids' groves are gone--so much the better:<br/>  Stonehenge is not--but what the devil is it?--But<br/>Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,<br/>  That madmen may not bite you on a visit;<br/>The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;<br/>  The Mansion House, too (though some people quiz it),<br/>To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;<br/>But then the Abbey's worth the whole collection.<br/><br/>The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,<br/>  Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation<br/>Like gold as in comparison to dross,<br/>  Matched with the Continent's illumination,<br/>Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.<br/>  The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,<br/>And when they grew so--on their new-found lantern,<br/>Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.<br/><br/>A row of Gentlemen along the streets<br/>  Suspended may illuminate mankind,<br/>As also bonfires made of country seats;<br/>  But the old way is best for the purblind:<br/>The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,<br/>  A sort of _ignis fatuus_ to the mind,<br/>Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,<br/>Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.<br/><br/>But London's so well lit, that if Diogenes<br/>  Could recommence to hunt his _honest man_,<br/>And found him not amidst the various progenies<br/>  Of this enormous City's spreading span,<br/>'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his<br/>  Yet undiscovered treasure. What _I_ can,<br/>I've done to find the same throughout Life's journey,<br/>But see the World is only one attorney.<br/><br/>Over the stones still rattling, up Pall Mall,<br/>  Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner<br/>As thundered knockers broke the long sealed spell<br/>  Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner<br/>Admitted a small party as night fell,--<br/>  Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,<br/>Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,<br/>St. James's Palace, and St. James's "Hells."<br/><br/>They reached the hotel: forth streamed from the front door<br/>  A tide of well-clad waiters, and around<br/>The mob stood, and as usual several score<br/>  Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound<br/>In decent London when the daylight's o'er;<br/>  Commodious but immoral, they are found<br/>Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.--<br/>But Juan now is stepping from his carriage<br/><br/>Into one of the sweetest of hotels,<br/>  Especially for foreigners--and mostly<br/>For those whom favour or whom Fortune swells,<br/>  And cannot find a bill's small items costly.<br/>There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells<br/>  (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),<br/>Until to some conspicuous square they pass,<br/>And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.<br/><br/>Juan, whose was a delicate commission,<br/>  Private, though publicly important, bore<br/>No title to point out with due precision<br/>  The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.<br/>'T was merely known, that on a secret mission<br/>  A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,<br/>Young, handsome, and accomplished, who was said<br/>(In whispers) to have turned his Sovereign's head.<br/><br/>Some rumour also of some strange adventures<br/>  Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;<br/>And as romantic heads are pretty painters,<br/>  And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves<br/>Into the excursive, breaking the indentures<br/>  Of sober reason, wheresoe'er it moves,<br/>He found himself extremely in the fashion,<br/>Which serves our thinking people for a passion.<br/><br/>I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite<br/>  The contrary; but then 't is in the head;<br/>Yet as the consequences are as bright<br/>  As if they acted with the heart instead,<br/>What after all can signify the site<br/>  Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead<br/>In safety to the place for which you start,<br/>What matters if the road be head or heart?<br/><br/>Juan presented in the proper place,<br/>  To proper placemen, every Russ credential;<br/>And was received with all the due grimace<br/>  By those who govern in the mood potential,<br/>Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,<br/>  Thought (what in state affairs is most essential),<br/>That they as easily might _do_ the youngster,<br/>As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.<br/><br/>They erred, as ag√©d men will do; but by<br/>  And by we'll talk of that; and if we don't,<br/>'T will be because our notion is not high<br/>  Of politicians and their double front,<br/>Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:--<br/>  Now what I love in women is, they won't<br/>Or can't do otherwise than lie--but do it<br/>So well, the very Truth seems falsehood to it.<br/><br/>And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but<br/>  The truth in masquerade; and I defy<br/>Historians--heroes--lawyers--priests, to put<br/>  A fact without some leaven of a lie.<br/>The very shadow of true Truth would shut<br/>  Up annals--revelations--poesy,<br/>And prophecy--except it should be dated<br/>Some years before the incidents related.<br/><br/>Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now<br/>  Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?<br/>She rings the World's "Te Deum," and her brow<br/>  Blushes for those who will not:--but to sigh<br/>Is idle; let us like most others bow,<br/>  Kiss hands--feet--any part of Majesty,<br/>After the good example of "Green Erin,"<br/>Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.<br/><br/>Don Juan was presented, and his dress<br/>  And mien excited general admiration--<br/>I don't know which was more admired or less:<br/>  One monstrous diamond drew much observation,<br/>Which Catherine in a moment of _"ivresse"_<br/>  (In Love or Brandy's fervent fermentation),<br/>Bestowed upon him, as the public learned;<br/>And, to say truth, it had been fairly earned.<br/><br/>Besides the ministers and underlings,<br/>  Who must be courteous to the accredited<br/>Diplomatists of rather wavering Kings,<br/>  Until their royal riddle's fully read,<br/>The very clerks,--those somewhat dirty springs<br/>  Of Office, or the House of Office, fed<br/>By foul corruption into streams,--even they<br/>Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:<br/><br/>And insolence no doubt is what they are<br/>  Employed for, since it is their daily labour,<br/>In the dear offices of Peace or War;<br/>  And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,<br/>When for a passport, or some other bar<br/>  To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),<br/>If he found not this spawn of tax-born riches,<br/>Like lap-dogs, the least civil sons of b-----s.<br/><br/>But Juan was received with much _"empressement:"_--<br/>  These phrases of refinement I must borrow<br/>From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,<br/>  There is a move set down for joy or sorrow,<br/>Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man<br/>  In Islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,<br/>More than on Continents--as if the Sea<br/>(See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.<br/><br/>And yet the British "Damme"'s rather Attic,<br/>  Your continental oaths are but incontinent,<br/>And turn on things which no aristocratic<br/>  Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent<br/>This subject quote; as it would be schismatic<br/>  In _politesse_, and have a sound affronting in 't;--<br/>But "Damme"'s quite ethereal, though too daring--<br/>Platonic blasphemy--the soul of swearing.<br/><br/>For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;<br/>  For true or false politeness (and scarce _that<br/>Now_) you may cross the blue deep and white foam--<br/>  The first the emblem (rarely though) of what<br/>You leave behind, the next of much you come<br/>  To meet. However, 't is no time to chat<br/>On general topics: poems must confine<br/>Themselves to unity, like this of mine.<br/><br/>In the great world,--which, being interpreted,<br/>  Meaneth the West or worst end of a city,<br/>And about twice two thousand people bred<br/>  By no means to be very wise or witty,<br/>But to sit up while others lie in bed,<br/>  And look down on the Universe with pity,--<br/>Juan, as an inveterate patrician,<br/>Was well received by persons of condition.<br/><br/>He was a bachelor, which is a matter<br/>  Of import both to virgin and to bride,<br/>The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;<br/>  And (should she not hold fast by Love or Pride)<br/>'T is also of some moment to the latter:<br/>  A rib's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,<br/>Requires decorum, and is apt to double<br/>The horrid sin--and what's still worse, the trouble.<br/><br/>But Juan was a bachelor--of arts,<br/>  And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had<br/>An air as sentimental as Mozart's<br/>  Softest of melodies; and could be sad<br/>Or cheerful, without any "flaws or starts,"<br/>  Just at the proper time: and though a lad,<br/>Had seen the world--which is a curious sight,<br/>And very much unlike what people write.<br/><br/>Fair virgins blushed upon him; wedded dames<br/>  Bloomed also in less transitory hues;<br/>For both commodities dwell by the Thames,<br/>  The painting and the painted; Youth, Ceruse,<br/>Against his heart preferred their usual claims,<br/>  Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:<br/>Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers<br/>Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.<br/><br/>The milliners who furnish "drapery Misses"<br/>  Throughout the season, upon speculation<br/>Of payment ere the Honeymoon's last kisses<br/>  Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,<br/>Thought such an opportunity as this is,<br/>  Of a rich foreigner's initiation,<br/>Not to be overlooked--and gave such credit,<br/>That future bridegrooms swore, and sighed, and paid it.<br/><br/>The Blues, that tender tribe, who sigh o'er sonnets,<br/>  And with the pages of the last Review<br/>Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,<br/>  Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:<br/>They talked bad French or Spanish, and upon its<br/>  Late authors asked him for a hint or two;<br/>And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?<br/>And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?<br/><br/>Juan, who was a little superficial,<br/>  And not in literature a great Drawcansir,<br/>Examined by this learn√©d and especial<br/>  Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:<br/>His duties warlike, loving or official,<br/>  His steady application as a dancer,<br/>Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,<br/>Which now he found was blue instead of green.<br/><br/>However, he replied at hazard, with<br/>  A modest confidence and calm assurance,<br/>Which lent his learn√©d lucubrations pith,<br/>  And passed for arguments of good endurance.<br/>That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith<br/>  (Who at sixteen translated "Hercules Furens"<br/>Into as furious English), with her best look,<br/>Set down his sayings in her common-place book.<br/><br/>Juan knew several languages--as well<br/>  He might--and brought them up with skill, in time<br/>To save his fame with each accomplished belle,<br/>  Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.<br/>There wanted but this requisite to swell<br/>  His qualities (with them) into sublime:<br/>Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,<br/>Both longed extremely to be sung in Spanish.<br/><br/>However, he did pretty well, and was<br/>  Admitted as an aspirant to all<br/>The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,<br/>  At great assemblies or in parties small,<br/>He saw ten thousand living authors pass,<br/>  That being about their average numeral;<br/>Also the eighty "greatest living poets,"<br/>As every paltry magazine can show _it's_.<br/><br/>In twice five years the "greatest living poet,"<br/>  Like to the champion in the fisty ring,<br/>Is called on to support his claim, or show it,<br/>  Although 't is an imaginary thing.<br/>Even I--albeit I'm sure I did not know it,<br/>  Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king,--<br/>Was reckoned, a considerable time,<br/>The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.<br/><br/>But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero<br/>  My Leipsic, and my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain:<br/>_La Belle Alliance_ of dunces down at zero,<br/>  Now that the Lion's fallen, may rise again:<br/>But I will fall at least as fell my Hero;<br/>  Nor reign at all, or as a _monarch_ reign;<br/>Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,<br/>With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.<br/><br/>Sir Walter reigned before me;

That's romantic! For my part,<br/>  I think that "Philo-genitiveness" is--<br/>(Now here's a word quite after my own heart,<br/>  Though there's a shorter a good deal than this,<br/>If that politeness set it not apart;<br/>  But I'm resolved to say nought that's amiss)--<br/>I say, methinks that "Philo-genitiveness"<br/>Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.<br/><br/>And now to business.--O my gentle Juan!<br/>  Thou art in London--in that pleasant place,<br/>Where every kind of mischief's daily brewing,<br/>  Which can await warm Youth in its wild race.<br/>'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;<br/>  Thou art no novice in the headlong chase<br/>Of early life; but this is a new land,<br/>Which foreigners can never understand.<br/><br/>What with a small diversity of climate,<br/>  Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,<br/>I could send forth my mandate like a Primate<br/>  Upon the rest of Europe's social state;<br/>But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,<br/>  Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.<br/>All countries have their "Lions," but in thee<br/>There is but one superb menagerie.<br/><br/>But I am sick of politics. Begin--<br/>  _"Paulo Majora."_ Juan, undecided<br/>Amongst the paths of being "taken in,"<br/>  Above the ice had like a skater glided:<br/>When tired of play, he flirted without sin<br/>  With some of those fair creatures who have prided<br/>Themselves on innocent tantalisation,<br/>And hate all vice except its reputation.<br/><br/>But these are few, and in the end they make<br/>  Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows<br/>That even the purest people may mistake<br/>  Their way through Virtue's primrose paths of snows;<br/>And then men stare, as if a new ass spake<br/>  To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows<br/>Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)<br/>With the kind World's Amen--"Who would have thought it?"<br/><br/>The little Leila, with her Orient eyes,<br/>  And taciturn Asiatic disposition,<br/>(Which saw all Western things with small surprise,<br/>  To the surprise of people of condition,<br/>Who think that novelties are butterflies<br/>  To be pursued as food for inanition,)<br/>Her charming figure and romantic history<br/>Became a kind of fashionable mystery.<br/><br/>The women much divided--as is usual<br/>  Amongst the sex in little things or great--<br/>Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all,<br/>  I have always liked you better than I state--<br/>Since I've grown moral, still I must accuse you all<br/>  Of being apt to talk at a great rate;<br/>And now there was a general sensation<br/>Amongst you, about Leila's education.<br/><br/>In one point only were you settled--and<br/>  You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,<br/>As beautiful as her own native land,<br/>  And far away, the last bud of her race,<br/>Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command<br/>  Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,<br/>Would be much better taught beneath the eye<br/>Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.<br/><br/>So first there was a generous emulation,<br/>  And then there was a general competition,<br/>To undertake the orphan's education:<br/>  As Juan was a person of condition,<br/>It had been an affront on this occasion<br/>  To talk of a subscription or petition;<br/>But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages<br/>Whose tale belongs to "Hallam's Middle Ages,"<br/><br/>And one or two sad, separate wives, without<br/>  A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough--<br/>Begged to bring _up_ the little girl, and _"out"_--<br/>  For that's the phrase that settles all things now,<br/>Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,<br/>  And all her points as thorough-bred to show:<br/>And I assure you, that like virgin honey<br/>Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).<br/><br/>How all the needy honourable misters,<br/>  Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,<br/>The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters,<br/>  (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy<br/>At making matches, where "'t is gold that glisters,"<br/>  Than their _he_ relatives), like flies o'er candy<br/>Buzz round "the Fortune" with their busy battery,<br/>To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!<br/><br/>Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;<br/>  Nay, married dames will now and then discover<br/>Such pure disinterestedness of passion,<br/>  I've known them court an heiress for their lover.<br/>"_Tantoene!_" Such the virtues of high station,<br/>  Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet's "Dover!"<br/>While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,<br/>Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.<br/><br/>Some are soon bagged, and some reject three dozen:<br/>  'T is fine to see them scattering refusals<br/>And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin<br/>  (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,<br/>Such as--"Unless Miss Blank meant to have chosen<br/>  Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals<br/>To his billets? _Why_ waltz with him? Why, I pray,<br/>Look _'Yes'_ last night, and yet say _'No'_ to-day?<br/><br/>"Why?--Why?--Besides, Fred really was _attached_;<br/>  'T was not her fortune--he has enough without;<br/>The time will come she'll wish that she had snatched<br/>  So good an opportunity, no doubt:--<br/>But the old Marchioness some plan had hatched,<br/>  As I'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:<br/>And after all poor Frederick may do better--<br/>Pray did you see her answer to his letter?"<br/><br/>Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets<br/>  Are spurned in turn, until her turn arrives,<br/>After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets<br/>  Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;<br/>And when at last the pretty creature gets<br/>  Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,<br/>It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected<br/>To find how very badly she selected.<br/><br/>For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,<br/>  Worn out with importunity; or fall<br/>(But here perhaps the instances are fewer)<br/>  To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.<br/>A hazy widower turned of forty 's sure<br/>  (If 't is not vain examples to recall)<br/>To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I<br/>See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.<br/><br/>I, for my part--(one "modern instance" more,<br/>  "True,'t is a pity--pity 't is, 't is true")--<br/>Was chosen from out an amatory score,<br/>  Albeit my years were less discreet than few;<br/>But though I also had reformed before<br/>  Those became one who soon were to be two,<br/>I'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,<br/>That the young lady made a monstrous choice.<br/><br/>Oh, pardon my digression--or at least<br/>  Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end<br/>That I dissert, like grace before a feast:<br/>  For like an ag√©d aunt, or tiresome friend,<br/>A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,<br/>  My Muse by exhortation means to mend<br/>All people, at all times, and in most places,<br/>Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.<br/><br/>But now I'm going to be immoral; now<br/>  I mean to show things really as they are,<br/>Not as they ought to be: for I avow,<br/>  That till we see what's what in fact, we're far<br/>From much improvement with that virtuous plough<br/>  Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar<br/>Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,<br/>Only to keep its corn at the old price.<br/><br/>But first of little Leila we'll dispose,<br/>  For like a day-dawn she was young and pure--<br/>Or like the old comparison of snows,<br/>  (Which are more pure than pleasant, to be sure,<br/>Like many people everybody knows),--<br/>  Don Juan was delighted to secure<br/>A goodly guardian for his infant charge,<br/>Who might not profit much by being at large.<br/><br/>Besides, he had found out he was no tutor<br/>  (I wish that others would find out the same),<br/>And rather wished in such things to stand neuter,<br/>  For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:<br/>So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor<br/>  To make his little wild Asiatic tame,<br/>Consulting "the Society for Vice<br/>Suppression," Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.<br/><br/>Olden she was--but had been very young;<br/>  Virtuous she was--and had been, I believe;<br/>Although the World has such an evil tongue<br/>  That--but my chaster ear will not receive<br/>An echo of a syllable that's wrong:<br/>  In fact, there's nothing makes me so much grieve,<br/>As that abominable tittle-tattle,<br/>Which is the cud eschewed by human cattle.<br/><br/>Moreover I've remarked (and I was once<br/>  A slight observer in a modest way),<br/>And so may every one except a dunce,<br/>  That ladies in their youth a little gay,<br/>Besides their knowledge of the World, and sense<br/>  Of the sad consequence of going astray,<br/>Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe<br/>Which the mere passionless can never know.<br/><br/>While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue<br/>  By railing at the unknown and envied passion,<br/>Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,<br/>  Or, what's still worse, to put you out of fashion,--<br/>The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,<br/>  Entreating you to pause before you dash on;<br/>Expounding and illustrating the riddle<br/>Of epic Love's beginning--end--and middle.<br/><br/>Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,<br/>  As better knowing why they should be so,<br/>I think you'll find from many a family picture,<br/>  That daughters of such mothers as may know<br/>The World by experience rather than by lecture,<br/>  Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show<br/>Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,<br/>Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.<br/><br/>I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talked about--<br/>  As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?<br/>But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalked about;<br/>  She merely was deemed amiable and witty,<br/>And several of her best _bons-mots_ were hawked about:<br/>  Then she was given to charity and pity,<br/>And passed (at least the latter years of life)<br/>For being a most exemplary wife.<br/><br/>High in high circles, gentle in her own,<br/>  She was the mild reprover of the young,<br/>Whenever--which means every day--they'd shown<br/>  An awkward inclination to go wrong.<br/>The quantity of good she did 's unknown,<br/>  Or at the least would lengthen out my song:<br/>In brief, the little orphan of the East<br/>Had raised an interest in her,--which increased.<br/><br/>Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,<br/>  Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,<br/>A little spoiled, but not so altogether;<br/>  Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,<br/>And how he had been tossed, he scarce knew whither:<br/>  Though this might ruin others, it did _not_ him,<br/>At least entirely--for he had seen too many<br/>Changes in Youth, to be surprised at any.<br/><br/>And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;<br/>  For when they happen at a riper age,<br/>People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,<br/>  And wonder Providence is not more sage.<br/>Adversity is the first path to Truth:<br/>  He who hath proved War--Storm--or Woman's rage,<br/>Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,<br/>Hath won the experience which is deemed so weighty.<br/><br/>How far it profits is another matter.--<br/>  Our hero gladly saw his little charge<br/>Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter<br/>  Being long married, and thus set at large,<br/>Had left all the accomplishments she taught her<br/>  To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,<br/>To the next comer; or--as it will tell<br/>More Muse-like--like to Cytherea's shell.<br/><br/>I call such things transmission; for there is<br/>  A floating balance of accomplishment,<br/>Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,<br/>  According as their minds or backs are bent.<br/>Some waltz--some draw--some fathom the abyss<br/>  Of Metaphysics; others are content<br/>With Music; the most moderate shine as wits;--<br/>While others have a genius turned for fits.<br/><br/>But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords--<br/>  Theology--fine arts--or finer stays,<br/>May be the baits for Gentlemen or Lords<br/>  With regular descent, in these our days,<br/>The last year to the new transfers its hoards;<br/>  New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise<br/>Of "elegant" _et c√¶tera_, in fresh batches--<br/>All matchless creatures--and yet bent on matches.<br/><br/>But now I will begin my poem. 'Tis<br/>  Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,<br/>That from the first of Cantos up to this<br/>  I've not begun what we have to go through.<br/>These first twelve books are merely flourishes,<br/>  _Preludios_, trying just a string or two<br/>Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;<br/>And when so, you shall have the overture.<br/><br/>My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin<br/>  About what's called success, or not succeeding:<br/>Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;<br/>  'T is a "great moral lesson" they are reading.<br/>I thought, at setting off, about two dozen<br/>  Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,<br/>If that my Pegasus should not be foundered,<br/>I think to canter gently through a hundred.<br/><br/>Don Juan saw that Microcosm on stilts,<br/>  Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,<br/>Although the highest: but as swords have hilts<br/>  By which their power of mischief is increased,<br/>When Man in battle or in quarrel tilts,<br/>  Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,<br/>Must still obey the high--which is their handle,<br/>Their Moon, their Sun, their gas, their farthing candle.<br/><br/>He had many friends who had many wives, and was<br/>  Well looked upon by both, to that extent<br/>Of friendship which you may accept or pass,<br/>  It does nor good nor harm; being merely meant<br/>To keep the wheels going of the higher class,<br/>  And draw them nightly when a ticket's sent;<br/>And what with masquerades, and f√™tes, and balls,<br/>For the first season such a life scarce palls.<br/><br/>A young unmarried man, with a good name<br/>  And fortune, has an awkward part to play;<br/>For good society is but a game,<br/>  "The royal game of Goose," as I may say,<br/>Where everybody has some separate aim,<br/>  An end to answer, or a plan to lay--<br/>The single ladies wishing to be double,<br/>The married ones to save the virgins trouble.<br/><br/>I don't mean this as general, but particular<br/>  Examples may be found of such pursuits:<br/>Though several also keep their perpendicular<br/>  Like poplars, with good principles for roots;<br/>Yet many have a method more _reticular_--<br/>  "Fishers for men," like Sirens with soft lutes:<br/>For talk six times with the same single lady,<br/>And you may get the wedding-dresses ready.<br/><br/>Perhaps you'll have a letter from the mother,<br/>  To say her daughter's feelings are trepanned;<br/>Perhaps you'll have a visit from the brother,<br/>  All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand<br/>What "your intentions are?"--One way or other<br/>  It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:<br/>And between pity for her case and yours,<br/>You'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.<br/><br/>I've known a dozen weddings made even _thus_,<br/>  And some of them high names: I have also known<br/>Young men who--though they hated to discuss<br/>  Pretensions which they never dreamed to have shown--<br/>Yet neither frightened by a female fuss,<br/>  Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,<br/>And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,<br/>In happier plight than if they formed a pair.<br/><br/>There's also nightly, to the uninitiated,<br/>  A peril--not indeed like Love or Marriage,<br/>But not the less for this to be depreciated:<br/>  It is--I meant and mean not to disparage<br/>The show of Virtue even in the vitiated--<br/>  It adds an outward grace unto their carriage--<br/>But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,<br/>_Couleur de rose_, who's neither white nor scarlet.<br/><br/>Such is your cold coquette, who can't say "No,"<br/>  And won't say "Yes," and keeps you on and off-ing<br/>On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow--<br/>  Then sees your heart wrecked, with an inward scoffing.<br/>This works a world of sentimental woe,<br/>  And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;<br/>But yet is merely innocent flirtation,<br/>Not quite adultery, but adulteration.<br/><br/>"Ye gods, I grow a talker!" Let us prate.<br/>  The next of perils, though I place it _stern_est,<br/>Is when, without regard to Church or State,<br/>  A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.<br/>Abroad, such things decide few women's fate--<br/>  (Such, early Traveller! is the truth thou learnest)--<br/>But in old England, when a young bride errs,<br/>Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.<br/><br/>For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit<br/>  Country, where a young couple of the same ages<br/>Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.<br/>  Then there's the vulgar trick of those d----d damages!<br/>A verdict--grievous foe to those who cause it!--<br/>  Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;<br/>Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,<br/>And evidences which regale all readers.<br/><br/>But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;<br/>  A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy<br/>Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,<br/>  The loveliest oligarchs of our Gynocracy;<br/>You may see such at all the balls and dinners,<br/>  Among the proudest of our aristocracy,<br/>So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste--<br/>And all by having _tact_ as well as taste.<br/><br/>Juan, who did not stand in the predicament<br/>  Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;<br/>For he was sick--no, 't was not the word _sick_ I meant--<br/>  But he had seen so much good love before,<br/>That he was not in heart so very weak;--I meant<br/>  But thus much, and no sneer against the shore<br/>Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings--<br/>Tithes, taxes, duns--and doors with double knockings.<br/><br/>But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,<br/>  Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risked for Passion<br/>And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,<br/>  Into a country where 't is half a fashion,<br/>Seemed to him half commercial, half pedantic,<br/> Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:<br/>Besides (alas! his taste--forgive and pity!)<br/>At _first_ he did not think the women pretty.<br/><br/>I say at _first_--for he found out at _last_,<br/>  But by degrees, that they were fairer far<br/>Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast<br/>  Beneath the influence of the Eastern Star.<br/>A further proof we should not judge in haste;<br/>  Yet inexperience could not be his bar<br/>To taste:--the truth is, if men would confess,<br/>That novelties _please_ less than they _impress_.<br/><br/>Though travelled, I have never had the luck to<br/>  Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,<br/>To that impracticable place Timbuctoo,<br/>  Where Geography finds no one to oblige her<br/>With such a chart as may be safely stuck to--<br/>  For Europe ploughs in Afric like "_bos piger_:"<br/>But if I _had been_ at Timbuctoo, there<br/>No doubt I should be told that black is fair.<br/><br/>It is. 1 will not swear that black is white,<br/>  But I suspect in fact that white is black,<br/>And the whole matter rests upon eye-sight:--<br/>  Ask a blind man, the best judge. You'll attack<br/>Perhaps this new position--but I'm right;<br/>  Or if I'm wrong, I'll not be ta'en aback:--<br/>He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark<br/>Within--and what seest thou? A dubious spark!<br/><br/>But I'm relapsing into Metaphysics,<br/>  That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same<br/>Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,<br/>  Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame:<br/>And this reflection brings me to plain Physics,<br/>  And to the beauties of a foreign dame,<br/>Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,<br/>Those polar summers, _all_ Sun, and some ice.<br/><br/>Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose<br/>  Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;--<br/>Not that there's not a quantity of those<br/>  Who have a due respect for their own wishes.<br/>Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows<br/>  Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:<br/>They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,<br/>As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.<br/><br/>But this has nought to do with their outsides.<br/>  I said that Juan did not think them pretty<br/>At the first blush;

and there<br/>Occurred what often happens, I'm afraid,<br/>  However disciplined and debonnaire:--<br/>The talent and good humour he displayed,<br/>  Besides the marked distinction of his air,<br/>Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,<br/>Even though himself avoided the occasion.<br/><br/>But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,<br/>  Is not to be put hastily together;<br/>And as my object is Morality<br/>  (Whatever people say), I don't know whether<br/>I'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,<br/>  But harrow up his feelings till they wither,<br/>And hew out a huge monument of pathos,<br/>As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.<br/><br/>Here the twelfth canto of our Introduction<br/>  Ends.

If I sneer sometimes,<br/>It is because I cannot well do less,<br/>  And now and then it also suits my rhymes.<br/>I should be very willing to redress<br/>  Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,<br/>Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale<br/>Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.<br/><br/>Of all tales 't is the saddest--and more sad,<br/>  Because it makes us smile: his hero's right,<br/>And still pursues the right;--to curb the bad<br/>  His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight<br/>His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!<br/>  But his adventures form a sorry sight;--<br/>A sorrier still is the great moral taught<br/>By that real Epic unto all who have thought.<br/><br/>Redressing injury, revenging wrong,<br/>  To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;<br/>Opposing singly the united strong,<br/>  From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:--<br/>Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,<br/>  Be for mere Fancy's sport a theme creative,<br/>A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!<br/>And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?<br/><br/>Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;<br/>  A single laugh demolished the right arm<br/>Of his own country;--seldom since that day<br/>  Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,<br/>The World gave ground before her bright array;<br/>  And therefore have his volumes done such harm,<br/>That all their glory, as a composition,<br/>Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.<br/><br/>I'm "at my old lunes"--digression, and forget<br/>  The Lady Adeline Amundeville;<br/>The fair most fatal Juan ever met,<br/>  Although she was not evil nor meant ill;<br/>But Destiny and Passion spread the net<br/>  (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),<br/>And caught them;--what do they _not_ catch, methinks?<br/>But I'm not Oedipus, and Life's a Sphinx.<br/><br/>I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare<br/>  To venture a solution: "_Davus sum!_"<br/>And now I will proceed upon the pair.<br/>  Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay World's hum,<br/>Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that's fair;<br/>  Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.<br/>The last's a miracle, and such was reckoned,<br/>And since that time there has not been a second.<br/><br/>Chaste was she, to Detraction's desperation,<br/>  And wedded unto one she had loved well--<br/>A man known in the councils of the Nation,<br/>  Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,<br/>Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,<br/>  Proud of himself and her: the World could tell<br/>Nought against either, and both seemed secure--<br/>She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.<br/><br/>It chanced some diplomatical relations,<br/>  Arising out of business, often brought<br/>Himself and Juan in their mutual stations<br/>  Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught<br/>By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,<br/>  And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,<br/>And formed a basis of esteem, which ends<br/>In making men what Courtesy calls friends.<br/><br/>And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as<br/>  Reserve and Pride could make him, and full slow<br/>In judging men--when once his judgment was<br/>  Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,<br/>Had all the pertinacity Pride has,<br/>  Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,<br/>And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,<br/>Because its own good pleasure hath decided.<br/><br/>His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,<br/>  Though oft well founded, which confirmed but more<br/>His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians<br/>  And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.<br/>His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,<br/>  Of common likings, which make some deplore<br/>What they should laugh at--the mere ague still<br/>Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.<br/><br/>"'T is not in mortals to command success:"<br/>  But _do you more_, Sempronius--_don't_ deserve it,<br/>And take my word, you won't have any less.<br/>  Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;<br/>Give gently way, when there's too great a press;<br/>  And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it;<br/>For, like a racer, or a boxer training,<br/>'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.<br/><br/>Lord Henry also liked to be superior,<br/>  As most men do, the little or the great;<br/>The very lowest find out an inferior,<br/>  At least they think so, to exert their state<br/>Upon: for there are very few things wearier<br/>  Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,<br/>Which mortals generously would divide,<br/>By bidding others carry while they ride.<br/><br/>In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,<br/>  O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;<br/>In years he had the advantage of Time's sequel;<br/>  And, as he thought, in country much the same--<br/>Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,<br/>  At which all modern nations vainly aim;<br/>And the Lord Henry was a great debater,<br/>So that few Members kept the House up later.<br/><br/>These were advantages: and then he thought--<br/>  It was his foible, but by no means sinister--<br/>That few or none more than himself had caught<br/>  Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:<br/>He liked to teach that which he had been taught,<br/>  And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;<br/>And reconciled all qualities which grace man,<br/>Always a patriot--and, sometimes, a placeman.<br/><br/>He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;<br/>  He almost honoured him for his docility;<br/>Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,<br/>  Or contradicted but with proud humility.<br/>He knew the World, and would not see depravity<br/>  In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,<br/>If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop--<br/>For then they are very difficult to stop.<br/><br/>And then he talked with him about Madrid,<br/>  Constantinople, and such distant places;<br/>Where people always did as they were bid,<br/>  Or did what they should not with foreign graces.<br/>Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid<br/>  Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;<br/>And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,<br/>Could back a horse, as Despots ride a Russian.<br/><br/>And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,<br/>  And diplomatic dinners, or at other--<br/>For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,<br/>  As in freemasonry a higher brother.<br/>Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;<br/>  His manner showed him sprung from a high mother,<br/>And all men like to show their hospitality<br/>To him whose breeding matches with his quality.<br/><br/>At Blank-Blank Square;--for we will break no squares<br/>  By naming streets: since men are so censorious,<br/>And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,<br/>  Reaping allusions private and inglorious,<br/>Where none were dreamt of, unto Love's affairs,<br/>  Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,<br/>That therefore do I previously declare,<br/>Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.<br/><br/>Also there bin another pious reason<br/>  For making squares and streets anonymous;<br/>Which is, that there is scarce a single season<br/>  Which doth not shake some very splendid house<br/>With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason--<br/>  A topic Scandal doth delight to rouse:<br/>Such I might stumble over unawares,<br/>Unless I knew the very chastest squares.<br/><br/>'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,<br/>  A place where peccadillos are unknown;<br/>But I have motives, whether wise or silly,<br/>  For letting that pure sanctuary alone.<br/>Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I<br/>  Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,<br/>A vestal shrine of Innocence of Heart:<br/>Such are--but I have lost the London Chart.<br/><br/>At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,<br/>  Was Juan a _recherch√©_, welcome guest,<br/>As many other noble scions were;<br/>  And some who had but Talent for their crest;<br/>Or Wealth, which is a passport everywhere;<br/>  Or even mere Fashion, which indeed's the best<br/>Recommendation; and to be well dressed<br/>Will very often supersede the rest.<br/><br/>And since "there's safety in a multitude<br/>  Of counsellors," as Solomon has said,<br/>Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;--<br/>  Indeed we see the daily proof displayed<br/>In Senates, at the Bar, in wordy feud,<br/>  Where'er collective wisdom can parade,<br/>Which is the only cause that we can guess<br/>Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;--<br/><br/>But as "there's safety" grafted in the number<br/>  "Of counsellors," for men,--thus for the sex<br/>A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;<br/>  Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex--<br/>Variety itself will more encumber.<br/>  'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks--<br/>And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's<br/>Self-love, there's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.<br/><br/>But Adeline had not the least occasion<br/>  For such a shield, which leaves but little merit<br/>To Virtue proper, or good education.<br/>  Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,<br/>Which judged Mankind at their due estimation;<br/>  And for coquetry, she disdained to wear it--<br/>Secure of admiration: its impression<br/>Was faint--as of an every-day possession.<br/><br/>To all she was polite without parade;<br/>  To some she showed attention of that kind<br/>Which flatters, but is flattery conveyed<br/>  In such a sort as cannot leave behind<br/>A trace unworthy either wife or maid;--<br/>  A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,<br/>To those who were, or passed for meritorious,<br/>Just to console sad Glory for being glorious;<br/><br/>Which is in all respects, save now and then,<br/>  A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze<br/>Upon the shades of those distinguished men<br/>  Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,<br/>The praise of persecution. Gaze again<br/>  On the most favoured; and amidst the blaze<br/>Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-browed,<br/>What can ye recognise?--a gilded cloud.<br/><br/>There also was of course in Adeline<br/>  That calm patrician polish in the address,<br/>Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line<br/>  Of anything which Nature would express;<br/>Just as a Mandarin finds nothing fine,--<br/>  At least his manner suffers not to guess,<br/>That anything he views can greatly please:<br/>Perhaps we have borrowed this from the Chinese--<br/><br/>Perhaps from Horace: his _"Nil admirari"_<br/>  Was what he called the "Art of Happiness"--<br/>An art on which the artists greatly vary,<br/>  And have not yet attained to much success.<br/>However, 't is expedient to be wary:<br/>  Indifference, certes, don't produce distress;<br/>And rash Enthusiasm in good society<br/>Were nothing but a moral inebriety.<br/><br/>But Adeline was not indifferent: for<br/>  (_Now_ for a common-place!) beneath the snow,<br/>As a Volcano holds the lava more<br/>  Within--_et c√¶tera_.

I don't err<br/>In this: whatever other blunders lie<br/>  Upon my shoulders, here I must aver<br/>My Muse a glass of _Weatherology_;<br/>  For Parliament is our barometer:<br/>Let Radicals its other acts attack,<br/>Its sessions form our only almanack.<br/><br/>When its quicksilver's down at zero,--lo!<br/>  Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!<br/>Wheels whirl from Carlton Palace to Soho,<br/>  And happiest they who horses can engage;<br/>The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row<br/>  Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;<br/>And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,<br/>Sigh--as the postboys fasten on the traces.<br/><br/>They and their bills, "Arcadians both," are left<br/>  To the Greek Kalends of another session.<br/>Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,<br/>  What hope remains?

as Day awoke,<br/>The branching stag swept down with all his herd,<br/>To quaff a brook which murmured like a bird.<br/><br/>Before the mansion lay a lucid Lake,<br/>  Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed<br/>By a river, which its softened way did take<br/>  In currents through the calmer water spread<br/>Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake<br/>  And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:<br/>The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood<br/>With their green faces fixed upon the flood.<br/><br/>Its outlet dashed into a deep cascade,<br/>  Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,<br/>Its shriller echoes--like an infant made<br/>  Quiet--sank into softer ripples, gliding<br/>Into a rivulet; and thus allayed,<br/>  Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding<br/>Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,<br/>According as the skies their shadows threw.<br/><br/>A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile<br/>  (While yet the Church was Rome's) stood half apart<br/>In a grand Arch, which once screened many an aisle.<br/>  These last had disappeared--a loss to Art:<br/>The first yet frowned superbly o'er the soil,<br/>  And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,<br/>Which mourned the power of Time's or Tempest's march,<br/>In gazing on that venerable Arch.<br/><br/>Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,<br/>  Twelve Saints had once stood sanctified in stone;<br/>But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,<br/>  But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,<br/>When each house was a fortalice--as tell<br/>  The annals of full many a line undone,--<br/>The gallant Cavaliers, who fought in vain<br/>For those who knew not to resign or reign.<br/><br/>But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,<br/>  The Virgin-Mother of the God-born Child,<br/>With her Son in her bless√©d arms, looked round,<br/>  Spared by some chance when all beside was spoiled:<br/>She made the earth below seem holy ground.<br/>  This may be superstition, weak or wild;<br/>But even the faintest relics of a shrine<br/>Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.<br/><br/>A mighty window, hollow in the centre,<br/>  Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,<br/>Through which the deepened glories once could enter,<br/>  Streaming from off the Sun like Seraph's wings,<br/>Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,<br/>  The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings<br/>The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire<br/>Lie with their Hallelujahs quenched like fire.<br/><br/>But in the noontide of the moon, and when<br/>  The wind is wing√©d from one point of heaven,<br/>There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then<br/>  Is musical--a dying accent driven<br/>Through the huge Arch, which soars and sinks again.<br/>  Some deem it but the distant echo given<br/>Back to the night wind by the waterfall,<br/>And harmonised by the old choral wall:<br/><br/>Others, that some original shape, or form<br/>  Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power<br/>(Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm<br/>  In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fixed hour)<br/>To this grey ruin: with a voice to charm,<br/>  Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;<br/>The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such<br/>The fact:--I've heard it,--once perhaps too much.<br/><br/>Amidst the court a Gothic fountain played,<br/>  Symmetrical, but decked with carvings quaint--<br/>Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,<br/>  And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:<br/>The spring gushed through grim mouths of granite made,<br/>  And sparkled into basins, where it spent<br/>Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,<br/>Like man's vain Glory, and his vainer troubles.<br/><br/>The Mansion's self was vast and venerable,<br/>  With more of the monastic than has been<br/>Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,<br/>  The cells, too, and Refectory, I ween:<br/>An exquisite small chapel had been able,<br/>  Still unimpaired, to decorate the scene;<br/>The rest had been reformed, replaced, or sunk,<br/>And spoke more of the baron than the monk.<br/><br/>Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, joined<br/>  By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,<br/>Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,<br/>  Formed a whole which, irregular in parts,<br/>Yet left a grand impression on the mind,<br/>  At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:<br/>We gaze upon a giant for his stature,<br/>Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.<br/><br/>Steel Barons, molten the next generation<br/>  To silken rows of gay and gartered Earls,<br/>Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation:<br/>  And Lady Marys blooming into girls,<br/>With fair long locks, had also kept their station:<br/>  And Countesses mature in robes and pearls:<br/>Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,<br/>Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.<br/><br/>Judges in very formidable ermine<br/>  Were there, with brows that did not much invite<br/>The accused to think their lordships would determine<br/>  His cause by leaning much from might to right:<br/>Bishops, who had not left a single sermon;<br/>  Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,<br/>As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)<br/>Of the "Star Chamber" than of "Habeas Corpus."<br/><br/>Generals, some all in armour, of the old<br/>  And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;<br/>Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,<br/>  Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:<br/>Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:<br/>  Nimrods, whose canvas scarce contained the steed;<br/>And, here and there, some stern high patriot stood,<br/>Who could not get the place for which he sued.<br/><br/>But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,<br/>  Fatigued with these hereditary glories,<br/>There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,<br/>  Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's:<br/>Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone<br/>  In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories<br/>Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted<br/>His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.<br/><br/>Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;<br/>  There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,<br/>Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain<br/>  Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:--<br/>But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,<br/>  Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:<br/>His bell-mouthed goblet makes me feel quite Danish<br/>Or Dutch with thirst--What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.<br/><br/>Oh, reader! if that thou canst read,--and know,<br/>  'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,<br/>To constitute a reader--there must go<br/>  Virtues of which both you and I have need;--<br/>Firstly, begin with the beginning--(though<br/>  That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed:<br/>Thirdly, commence not with the end--or, sinning<br/>In this sort, end at last with the beginning.<br/><br/>But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,<br/>  While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,<br/>Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,<br/>  Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.<br/>That Poets were so from their earliest date,<br/>  By Homer's "Catalogue of ships" is clear;<br/>But a mere modern must be moderate--<br/>I spare you then the furniture and plate.<br/><br/>The mellow Autumn came, and with it came<br/>  The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.<br/>The corn is cut, the manor full of game;<br/>  The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats<br/>In russet jacket:--lynx-like in his aim;<br/>  Full grows his bag, and wonder_ful_ his feats.<br/>Ah, nutbrown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!<br/>And ah, ye poachers!--'T is no sport for peasants.<br/><br/>An English Autumn, though it hath no vines,<br/>  Blushing with Bacchant coronals along<br/>The paths o'er which the far festoon entwines<br/>  The red grape in the sunny lands of song,<br/>Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;<br/>  The Claret light, and the Madeira strong.<br/>If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,<br/>The very best of vineyards is the cellar.<br/><br/>Then, if she hath not that serene decline<br/>  Which makes the southern Autumn's day appear<br/>As if 't would to a second Spring resign<br/>  The season, rather than to Winter drear,--<br/>Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,--<br/>  The sea-coal fires, the "earliest of the year;"<br/>Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,<br/>As what is lost in green is gained in yellow.<br/><br/>And for the effeminate _villeggialura_--<br/>  Rife with more horns than hounds--she hath the chase,<br/>So animated that it might allure a<br/>  Saint from his beads to join the jocund race:<br/>Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,<br/>  And wear the Melton jacket for a space:<br/>If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame<br/>Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.<br/><br/>The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,<br/>  Consisted of--we give the sex the _pas_--<br/>The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;<br/>  The Ladies Scilly, Busey;--Miss Eclat,<br/>Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,<br/>  And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;<br/>Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,<br/>Who looked a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:<br/><br/>With other Countesses of Blank--but rank;<br/>  At once the "lie" and the _√©lite_ of crowds;<br/>Who pass like water filtered in a tank,<br/>  All purged and pious from their native clouds;<br/>Or paper turned to money by the Bank:<br/>  No matter how or why, the passport shrouds<br/>The _pass√©e_ and the past; for good society<br/>Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,--<br/><br/>That is, up to a certain point; which point<br/>  Forms the most difficult in punctuation.<br/>Appearances appear to form the joint<br/>  On which it hinges in a higher station;<br/>And so that no explosion cry "Aroint<br/>  Thee, witch!" or each Medea has her Jason;<br/>Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)<br/>_"Omne tulit punctum,_ qu√¶ _miscuit utile dulci."_<br/><br/>I can't exactly trace their rule of right,<br/>  Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.<br/>I've seen a virtuous woman put down quite<br/>  By the mere combination of a coterie;<br/>Also a so-so matron boldly fight<br/>  Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,<br/>And shine the very _Siria_, of the spheres,<br/>Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.<br/><br/>I have seen more than I'll say:--but we will see<br/>  How _our "villeggiatura"_ will get on.<br/>The party might consist of thirty-three<br/>  Of highest caste--the Brahmins of the _ton_.<br/>I have named a few, not foremost in degree,<br/>  But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.<br/>By way of sprinkling, scattered amongst these,<br/>There also were some Irish absentees.<br/><br/>There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,<br/>  Who limits all his battles to the Bar<br/>And Senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,<br/>  He shows more appetite for words than war.<br/>There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly<br/>  Come out and glimmered as a six weeks' star.<br/>There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;<br/>And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.<br/><br/>There was the Duke of Dash, who was a--duke,<br/>  "Aye, every inch a" duke; there were twelve peers<br/>Like Charlemagne's--and all such peers in _look_<br/>  And _intellect_, that neither eyes nor ears<br/>For commoners had ever them mistook.<br/>  There were the six Miss Rawbolds--pretty dears!<br/>All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set<br/>Less on a convent than a coronet.<br/><br/>There were four Honourable Misters, whose<br/>  Honour was more before their names than after;<br/>There was the _preux Chevalier de la Ruse_,<br/>  Whom France and Fortune lately deigned to waft here,<br/>Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;<br/>  But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,<br/>Because--such was his magic power to please--<br/>The dice seemed charmed, too, with his repartees.<br/><br/>There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,<br/>  Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;<br/>Angle, the _soi-disant_ mathematician;<br/>  Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.<br/>There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,<br/>  Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner:<br/>And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,<br/>Good at all things, but better at a bet.<br/><br/>There was Jack Jargon, the gigantic guardsman;<br/>  And General Fireface, famous in the field,<br/>A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,<br/>  Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he killed.<br/>There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,<br/>  In his grave office so completely skilled,<br/>That when a culprit came for condemnation,<br/>He had his Judge's joke for consolation.<br/><br/>Good company's a chess-board--there are kings,<br/>  Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the World's a game;<br/>Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,<br/>  Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.<br/>My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,<br/>  Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,<br/>Alighting rarely:--were she but a hornet,<br/>Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.<br/><br/>I had forgotten--but must not forget--<br/>  An orator, the latest of the session,<br/>Who had delivered well a very set<br/>  Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression<br/>Upon debate: the papers echoed yet<br/>  With his _d√©but_, which made a strong impression,<br/>And ranked with what is every day displayed--<br/>"The best first speech that ever yet was made."<br/><br/>Proud of his "Hear hims!" proud, too, of his vote,<br/>  And lost virginity of oratory,<br/>Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),<br/>  He revelled in his Ciceronian glory:<br/>With memory excellent to get by rote,<br/>  With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,<br/>Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,<br/>"His country's pride," he came down to the country.<br/><br/>There also were two wits by acclamation,<br/>  Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed--Both<br/>lawyers and both men of education--<br/>  But Strongbow's wit was of more polished breed;<br/>Longbow was rich in an imagination<br/>  As beautiful and bounding as a steed,<br/>But sometimes stumbling over a potato,--<br/>While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.<br/><br/>Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;<br/>  But Longbow wild as an √Üolian harp,<br/>With which the Winds of heaven can claim accord,<br/>  And make a music, whether flat or sharp.<br/>Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:<br/>  At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:<br/>Both wits--one born so, and the other bred--<br/>This by his heart--his rival by his head.<br/><br/>If all these seem an heterogeneous mass<br/>  To be assembled at a country seat,<br/>Yet think, a specimen of every class<br/>  Is better than a humdrum t√™te-√†-t√™te.<br/>The days of Comedy are gone, alas!<br/>  When Congreve's fool could vie with Moli√®re's _b√™te_:<br/>Society is smoothed to that excess,<br/>That manners hardly differ more than dress.<br/><br/>Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground--<br/>  Ridiculous enough, but also dull;<br/>Professions, too, are no more to be found<br/>  Professional; and there is nought to cull<br/>Of Folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,<br/>  They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.<br/>Society is now one polished horde,<br/>Formed of two mighty tribes, the _Bores_ and _Bored_.<br/><br/>But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning<br/>  The scanty but right-well threshed ears of Truth;<br/>And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,<br/>  You may be Boaz, and I--modest Ruth.<br/>Further I'd quote, but Scripture intervening<br/>  Forbids. A great impression in my youth<br/>Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,<br/>"That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies."<br/><br/>But what we can we glean in this vile age<br/>  Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.<br/>I must not quite omit the talking sage,<br/>  Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,<br/>Who, in his common-place book, had a page<br/>  Prepared each morn for evenings. "List, oh list!"<br/>"Alas, poor ghost!"--What unexpected woes<br/>Await those who have studied their _bons-mots!_<br/><br/>Firstly, they must allure the conversation,<br/>  By many windings to their clever clinch;<br/>And secondly, must let slip no occasion,<br/>  Nor _bate_ (abate) their hearers of an _inch_,<br/>But take an ell--and make a great sensation,<br/>  If possible; and thirdly, never flinch<br/>When some smart talker puts them to the test,<br/>But seize the last word, which no doubt's the best.<br/><br/>Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;<br/>  The party we have touched on were the guests.<br/>Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts<br/>  To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.<br/>I will not dwell upon _rago√ªts_ or roasts,<br/>  Albeit all human history attests<br/>That happiness for Man--the hungry sinner!--<br/>Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.<br/><br/>Witness the lands which "flowed with milk and honey,"<br/>  Held out unto the hungry Israelites:<br/>To this we have added since, the love of money,<br/>  The only sort of pleasure which requites.<br/>Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;<br/>  We tire of mistresses and parasites;<br/>But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?<br/>When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!<br/><br/>The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,<br/>  Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport--<br/>The first thing boys like after play and fruit;<br/>  The middle-aged, to make the day more short;<br/>For _ennui_ is a growth of English root,<br/>  Though nameless in our language:--we retort<br/>The fact for words, and let the French translate<br/>That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.<br/><br/>The elderly walked through the library,<br/>  And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,<br/>Or sauntered through the gardens piteously,<br/>  And made upon the hot-house several strictures,<br/>Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,<br/>  Or on the morning papers read their lectures,<br/>Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,<br/>Longing at sixty for the hour of six.<br/><br/>But none were _g√™n√©_: the great hour of union<br/>  Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were<br/>Masters of their own time--or in communion,<br/>  Or solitary, as they chose to bear<br/>The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.<br/>  Each rose up at his own, and had to spare<br/>What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast<br/>When, where, and how he chose for that repast.<br/><br/>The ladies--some rouged, some a little pale--<br/>  Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,<br/>Or walked; if foul, they read, or told a tale,<br/>  Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;<br/>Discussed the fashion which might next prevail,<br/>  And settled bonnets by the newest code,<br/>Or crammed twelve sheets into one little letter,<br/>To make each correspondent a new debtor.<br/><br/>For some had absent lovers, all had friends;<br/>  The earth has nothing like a she epistle,<br/>And hardly Heaven--because it never ends--<br/>  I love the mystery of a female missal,<br/>Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,<br/>  But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,<br/>When he allured poor Dolon:--you had better<br/>Take care what you reply to such a letter.<br/><br/>Then there were billiards; cards, too, but _no_ dice;--<br/>  Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;--<br/>Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,<br/>  And the hard frost destroyed the scenting days:<br/>And angling, too, that solitary vice,<br/>  Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says:<br/>The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet<br/>Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.<br/><br/>With evening came the banquet and the wine;<br/>  The conversazione--the duet<br/>Attuned by voices more or less divine<br/>  (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).<br/>The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;<br/>  But the two youngest loved more to be set<br/>Down to the harp--because to Music's charms<br/>They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.<br/><br/>Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,<br/>  For then the gentlemen were rather tired)<br/>Displayed some sylph-like figures in its maze;<br/>  Then there was small-talk ready when required;<br/>Flirtation--but decorous; the mere praise<br/>  Of charms that should or should not be admired.<br/>The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,<br/>And then retreated soberly--at ten.<br/><br/>The politicians, in a nook apart,<br/>  Discussed the World, and settled all the spheres:<br/>The wits watched every loophole for their art,<br/>  To introduce a _bon-mot_ head and ears;<br/>Small is the rest of those who would be smart,<br/>  A moment's good thing may have cost them years<br/>Before they find an hour to introduce it;<br/>And then, even _then_, some bore may make them lose it.<br/><br/>But all was gentle and aristocratic<br/>  In this our party; polished, smooth, and cold,<br/>As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.<br/>  There now are no Squire Westerns, as of old;<br/>And our Sophias are not so emphatic,<br/>  But fair as then, or fairer to behold:<br/>We have no accomplished blackguards, like Tom Jones,<br/>But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.<br/><br/>They separated at an early hour;<br/>  That is, ere midnight--which is London's noon:<br/>But in the country ladies seek their bower<br/>  A little earlier than the waning moon.<br/>Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower--<br/>  May the rose call back its true colour soon!<br/>Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,<br/>And lower the price of rouge--at least some winters.<br/><br/>CANTO THE FOURTEENTH.<br/><br/>IF from great Nature's or our own abyss<br/>  Of Thought we could but snatch a certainty,<br/>Perhaps Mankind might find the path they miss--<br/>  But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.<br/>One system eats another up, and this<br/>  Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;<br/>For when his pious consort gave him stones<br/>In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.<br/><br/>But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,<br/>  And eats her parents, albeit the digestion<br/>Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,<br/>  After due search, your faith to any question?<br/>Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast<br/>  You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.<br/>Nothing more true than _not_ to trust your senses;<br/>And yet what are your other evidences?<br/><br/>For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,<br/>  Admit--reject--contemn: and what know _you_,<br/>Except perhaps that you were born to die?<br/>  And both may after all turn out untrue.<br/>An age may come, Font of Eternity,<br/>  When nothing shall be either old or new.<br/>Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep,<br/>And yet a third of Life is passed in sleep.<br/><br/>A sleep without dreams, after a rough day<br/>  Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet<br/>How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!<br/>  The very Suicide that pays his debt<br/>At once without instalments (an old way<br/>  Of paying debts, which creditors regret),<br/>Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,<br/>Less from disgust of Life than dread of Death.<br/><br/>'T is round him--near him--here--there--everywhere--<br/>  And there's a courage which grows out of fear,<br/>Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare<br/>  The worst to _know_ it:--when the mountains rear<br/>Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there<br/>  You look down o'er the precipice, and drear<br/>The gulf of rock yawns,--you can't gaze a minute,<br/>Without an awful wish to plunge within it.<br/><br/>'T is true, you don't--but, pale and struck with terror,<br/>  Retire: but look into your past impression!<br/>And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror<br/>  Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,<br/>The lurking bias, be it truth or error,<br/>  To the _unknown_; a secret prepossession,<br/>To plunge with all your fears--but where? You know not,<br/>And that's the reason why you do--or do not.<br/><br/>But what's this to the purpose? you will say.<br/>  Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,<br/>For which my sole excuse is--'t is my way;<br/>  Sometimes _with_ and sometimes without occasion,<br/>I write what's uppermost, without delay;<br/>  This narrative is not meant for narration,<br/>But a mere airy and fantastic basis,<br/>To build up common things with common places.<br/><br/>You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,<br/>  "Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;"<br/>And such a straw, borne on by human breath,<br/>  Is Poesy, according as the Mind glows;<br/>A paper kite which flies 'twixt Life and Death,<br/>  A shadow which the onward Soul behind throws:<br/>And mine's a bubble, not blown up for praise,<br/>But just to play with, as an infant plays.<br/><br/>The World is all before me--or behind;<br/>  For I have seen a portion of that same,<br/>And quite enough for me to keep in mind;--<br/>  Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,<br/>To the great pleasure of our friends, Mankind,<br/>  Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;<br/>For I was rather famous in my time,<br/>Until I fairly knocked it up with rhyme.<br/><br/>I have brought this world about my ears, and eke<br/>  The other; that's to say, the Clergy--who<br/>Upon my head have bid their thunders break<br/>  In pious libels by no means a few.<br/>And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,<br/>  Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.<br/>In Youth I wrote because my mind was full,<br/>And _now_ because I feel it growing dull.<br/><br/>But "why then publish?"--There are no rewards<br/>  Of fame or profit when the World grows weary.<br/>I ask in turn,--Why do you play at cards?<br/>  Why drink? Why read?--To make some hour less dreary.<br/>It occupies me to turn back regards<br/>  On what I've seen or pondered, sad or cheery;<br/>And what I write I cast upon the stream,<br/>To swim or sink--I have had at least my dream.<br/><br/>I think that were I _certain_ of success,<br/>  I hardly could compose another line:<br/>So long I've battled either more or less,<br/>  That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.<br/>This feeling 't is not easy to express,<br/>  And yet 't is not affected, I opine.<br/>In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing--<br/>The one is winning, and the other losing.<br/><br/>Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:<br/>  She gathers a repertory of facts,<br/>Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,<br/>  But mostly sings of human things and acts--<br/>And that's one cause she meets with contradiction;<br/>  For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;<br/>And were her object only what's called Glory,<br/>With more ease too she'd tell a different story.<br/><br/>Love--War--a tempest--surely there's variety;<br/>  Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;<br/>A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;<br/>  A slight glance thrown on men of every station.<br/>If you have nought else, here's at least satiety,<br/>  Both in performance and in preparation;<br/>And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,<br/>Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.<br/><br/>The portion of this World which I at present<br/>  Have taken up to fill the following sermon,<br/>Is one of which there's no description recent:<br/>  The reason why is easy to determine:<br/>Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,<br/>  There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,<br/>A dull and family likeness through all ages,<br/>Of no great promise for poetic pages.<br/><br/>With much to excite, there's little to exalt;<br/>  Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;<br/>A sort of varnish over every fault;<br/>  A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;<br/>Factitious passions--Wit without much salt--<br/>  A want of that true nature which sublimes<br/>Whate'er it shows with Truth; a smooth monotony<br/>Of character, in those at least who have got any.<br/><br/>Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,<br/>  They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;<br/>But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,<br/>  And they must be or seem what they _were_: still<br/>Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade:<br/>  But when of the first sight you have had your fill,<br/>It palls--at least it did so upon me,<br/>This paradise of Pleasure and _Ennui_.<br/><br/>When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,<br/>  Dressed, voted, shone, and, may be, something more--<br/>With dandies dined--heard senators declaiming--<br/>  Seen beauties brought to market by the score,<br/>Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming--<br/>  There's little left but to be bored or bore.<br/>Witness those _ci-devant jeunes hommes_ who stem<br/>The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.<br/><br/>'T is said--indeed a general complaint--<br/>  That no one has succeeded in describing<br/>The _monde_, exactly as they ought to paint:<br/>  Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing<br/>The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,<br/>  To furnish matter for their moral gibing;<br/>And that their books have but one style in common--<br/>My Lady's prattle, filtered through her woman.<br/><br/>But this can't well be true, just now; for writers<br/>  Are grown of the _beau monde_ a part potential:<br/>I've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,<br/>  Especially when young, for that's essential.<br/>Why do their sketches fail them as inditers<br/>  Of what they deem themselves most consequential,<br/>The _real_ portrait of the highest tribe?<br/>'T is that--in fact--there's little to describe.<br/><br/>_"Haud ignara loquor;"_ these are _Nugae_, "_quarum<br/>  Pars_ parva _fui_," but still art and part.<br/>Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,<br/>  A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,<br/>Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,<br/>  For reasons which I choose to keep apart.<br/>_"Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit"_--<br/>Which means, that vulgar people must not share it.<br/><br/>And therefore what I throw off is ideal--<br/>  Lowered, leavened, like a history of Freemasons,<br/>Which bears the same relation to the real,<br/>  As Captain Parry's Voyage may do to Jason's.<br/>The grand _Arcanum_'s not for men to see all;<br/>  My music has some mystic diapasons;<br/>And there is much which could not be appreciated<br/>In any manner by the uninitiated.<br/><br/>Alas! worlds fall--and Woman, since she felled<br/>  The World (as, since that history, less polite<br/>Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held),<br/>  Has not yet given up the practice quite.<br/>Poor Thing of Usages! coerced, compelled,<br/>  Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,<br/>Condemned to child-bed, as men for their sins<br/>Have shaving too entailed upon their chins,--<br/><br/>A daily plague, which in the aggregate<br/>  May average on the whole with parturition.--<br/>But as to women--who can penetrate<br/>  The real sufferings of their she condition?<br/>Man's very sympathy with their estate<br/>  Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.<br/>Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,<br/>But form good housekeepers--to breed a nation.<br/><br/>All this were very well, and can't be better;<br/>  But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,<br/>So many troubles from her birth beset her,<br/>  Such small distinction between friends and foes;<br/>The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,<br/>  That--but ask any woman if she'd choose<br/>(Take her at thirty, that is) to have been<br/>Female or male? a schoolboy or a Queen?<br/><br/>"Petticoat Influence" is a great reproach,<br/>  Which even those who obey would fain be thought<br/>To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;<br/>  But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,<br/>By various joltings of Life's hackney coach,<br/>  I for one venerate a petticoat--<br/>A garment of a mystical sublimity,<br/>No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.<br/><br/>Much I respect, and much I have adored,<br/>  In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,<br/>Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,<br/>  And more attracts by all it doth conceal--<br/>A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,<br/>  A loving letter with a mystic seal,<br/>A cure for grief--for what can ever rankle<br/>Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?<br/><br/>And when upon a silent, sullen day,<br/>  With a Sirocco, for example, blowing,<br/>When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,<br/>  And sulkily the river's ripple's flowing,<br/>And the sky shows that very ancient gray,<br/>  The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,--<br/>'T is pleasant, if _then_ anything is pleasant,<br/>To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.<br/><br/>We left our heroes and our heroines<br/>  In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,<br/>Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,<br/>  Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,<br/>Because the Sun, and stars, and aught that shines,<br/>  Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,<br/>Are there oft dull and dreary as a _dun_--<br/>Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.<br/><br/>An in-door life is less poetical;<br/>  And out-of-door hath showers, and mists, and sleet<br/>With which I could not brew a pastoral:<br/>  But be it as it may, a bard must meet<br/>All difficulties, whether great or small,<br/>  To spoil his undertaking, or complete--<br/>And work away--like Spirit upon Matter--<br/>Embarrassed somewhat both with fire and water.<br/><br/>Juan--in this respect, at least, like saints--<br/>  Was all things unto people of all sorts,<br/>And lived contentedly, without complaints,<br/>  In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts--<br/>Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,<br/>  And mingling modestly in toils or sports.<br/>He likewise could be most things to all women,<br/>Without the coxcombry of certain _she_ men.<br/><br/>A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;<br/>  'T is also subject to the double danger<br/>Of tumbling first, and having in exchange<br/>  Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:<br/>But Juan had been early taught to range<br/>  The wilds, as doth an Arab turned avenger,<br/>So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,<br/>Knew that he had a rider on his back.<br/><br/>And now in this new field, with some applause,<br/>  He cleared hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,<br/>And never _craned_ and made but few _"faux pas,"_<br/>  And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.<br/>He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws<br/>  Of hunting--for the sagest youth is frail;<br/>Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,<br/>And once o'er several Country Gentlemen.<br/><br/>But on the whole, to general admiration,<br/>  He acquitted both himself and horse: the Squires<br/>Marvelled at merit of another nation;<br/>  The boors cried "Dang it! who'd have thought it?"--Sires,<br/>The Nestors of the sporting generation,<br/>  Swore praises, and recalled their former fires;<br/>The Huntsman's self relented to a grin,<br/>And rated him almost a whipper-in.<br/><br/>Such were his trophies--not of spear and shield,<br/>  But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;<br/>Yet I must own,--although in this I yield<br/>  To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,--<br/>He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,<br/>  Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,<br/>And what not, though he rode beyond all price.<br/>Asked next day, "If men ever hunted _twice_?"<br/><br/>He also had a quality uncommon<br/>  To early risers after a long chase,<br/>Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon<br/>  December's drowsy day to his dull race,--<br/>A quality agreeable to Woman,<br/>  When her soft, liquid words run on apace,<br/>Who likes a listener, whether Saint or Sinner,--<br/>He did not fall asleep just after dinner;<br/><br/>But, light and airy, stood on the alert,<br/>  And shone in the best part of dialogue,<br/>By humouring always what they might assert,<br/>  And listening to the topics most in vogue,<br/>Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;<br/>  And smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!<br/>He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;--<br/>In short, there never was a better hearer.<br/><br/>And then he danced;--all foreigners excel<br/>  The serious Angles in the eloquence<br/>Of pantomime!--he danced, I say, right well,<br/>  With emphasis, and also with good sense--<br/>A thing in footing indispensable;<br/>  He danced without theatrical pretence,<br/>Not like a ballet-master in the van<br/>Of his drilled nymphs, but like a gentleman.<br/><br/>Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,<br/>  And Elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;<br/>Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimmed the ground,<br/>  And rather held in than put forth his vigour;<br/>And then he had an ear for Music's sound,<br/>  Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.<br/>Such classic _pas_--sans flaws--set off our hero,<br/>He glanced like a personified Bolero;<br/><br/>Or like a flying Hour before Aurora,<br/>  In Guido's famous fresco (which alone<br/>Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a<br/>  Remnant were there of the old World's sole throne):<br/>The "_tout ensemble_" of his movements wore a<br/>  Grace of the soft Ideal, seldom shown,<br/>And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour<br/>Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.<br/><br/>No marvel then he was a favourite;<br/>  A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;<br/>A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;<br/>  At least he kept his vanity retired.<br/>Such was his tact, he could alike delight<br/>  The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.<br/>The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved _tracasserie_,<br/>Began to treat him with some small _agacerie_.<br/><br/>She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,<br/>  Desirable, distinguished, celebrated<br/>For several winters in the grand, _grand Monde_:<br/>  I'd rather not say what might be related<br/>Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;<br/>  Besides there might be falsehood in what's stated:<br/>Her late performance had been a dead set<br/>At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<br/><br/>This noble personage began to look<br/>  A little black upon this new flirtation;<br/>But such small licences must lovers brook,<br/>  Mere freedoms of the female corporation.<br/>Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!<br/>  'Twill but precipitate a situation<br/>Extremely disagreeable, but common<br/>To calculators when they count on Woman.<br/><br/>The circle smiled, then whispered, and then sneered;<br/>  The misses bridled, and the matrons frowned;<br/>Some hoped things might not turn out as they feared;<br/>  Some would not deem such women could be found;<br/>Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;<br/>  Some looked perplexed, and others looked profound:<br/>And several pitied with sincere regret<br/>Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<br/><br/>But what is odd, none ever named the Duke,<br/>  Who, one might think, was something in the affair:<br/>True, he was absent, and, 'twas rumoured, took<br/>  But small concern about the when, or where,<br/>Or what his consort did: if he could brook<br/>  Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:<br/>Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,<br/>Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.<br/><br/>But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!<br/>  Fired with an abstract love of Virtue, she,<br/>My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,<br/>  Began to think the Duchess' conduct free;<br/>Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,<br/>  And waxing chiller in her courtesy,<br/>Looked grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,<br/>For which most friends reserve their sensibility.<br/><br/>There's nought in this bad world like sympathy:<br/>  'Tis so becoming to the soul and face,<br/>Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,<br/>  And robes sweet Friendship in a Brussels lace.<br/>Without a friend, what were Humanity,<br/>  To hunt our errors up with a good grace?<br/>Consoling us with--"Would you had thought twice!<br/>Ah!

why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty<br/>  With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew:<br/>Reset it--shave more smoothly, also slower,<br/>If but to keep thy credit as a mower.<br/><br/>But Adeline was far from that ripe age,<br/>  Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:<br/>'Twas rather her Experience made her sage,<br/>  For she had seen the World and stood its test,<br/>As I have said in--I forget what page;<br/>  My Muse despises reference, as you have guessed<br/>By this time;--but strike six from seven-and-twenty,<br/>And you will find her sum of years in plenty.<br/><br/>At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,<br/>  She put all coronets into commotion:<br/>At seventeen, too, the World was still enchanted<br/>  With the new Venus of their brilliant Ocean:<br/>At eighteen, though below her feet still panted<br/>  A Hecatomb of suitors with devotion,<br/>She had consented to create again<br/>That Adam, called "The happiest of Men."<br/><br/>Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,<br/>  Admired, adored; but also so correct,<br/>That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,<br/>  Without the apparel of being circumspect:<br/>They could not even glean the slightest splinters<br/>  From off the marble, which had no defect.<br/>She had also snatched a moment since her marriage<br/>To bear a son and heir--and one miscarriage.<br/><br/>Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,<br/>  Those little glitterers of the London night;<br/>But none of these possessed a sting to wound her--<br/>  She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.<br/>Perhaps she wished an aspirant profounder;<br/>  But whatsoe'er she wished, she acted right;<br/>And whether Coldness, Pride, or Virtue dignify<br/>A Woman--so she's good--what _does_ it signify?<br/><br/>I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle<br/>  Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,<br/>Leaving all-claretless the unmoistened throttle,<br/>  Especially with politics on hand;<br/>I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,<br/>  Who whirl the dust as Simooms whirl the sand;<br/>I hate it as I hate an argument,<br/>A Laureate's Ode, or servile Peer's "Content."<br/><br/>'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,<br/>  They are so much intertwisted with the earth;<br/>So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,<br/>  I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.<br/>To trace all actions to their secret springs<br/>  Would make indeed some melancholy mirth:<br/>But this is not at present my concern,<br/>And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.<br/><br/>With the kind view of saving an _√©clat_,<br/>  Both to the Duchess and Diplomatist,<br/>The Lady Adeline, as soon's she saw<br/>  That Juan was unlikely to resist--<br/>(For foreigners don't know that a _faux pas_<br/>  In England ranks quite on a different list<br/>From those of other lands unblest with juries,<br/>Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is;--)<br/><br/>The Lady Adeline resolved to take<br/>  Such measures as she thought might best impede<br/>The farther progress of this sad mistake.<br/>  She thought with some simplicity indeed;<br/>But Innocence is bold even at the stake,<br/>  And simple in the World, and doth not need<br/>Nor use those palisades by dames erected,<br/>Whose virtue lies in never being detected.<br/><br/>It was not that she feared the very worst:<br/>  His Grace was an enduring, married man,<br/>And was not likely all at once to burst<br/>  Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan<br/>Of Doctors' Commons; but she dreaded first<br/>  The magic of her Grace's talisman,<br/>And next a quarrel (as he seemed to fret)<br/>With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<br/><br/>Her Grace, too, passed for being an _intrigante_,<br/>  And somewhat _m√©chante_ in her amorous sphere;<br/>One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt<br/>  A lover with caprices soft and dear,<br/>That like to _make_ a quarrel, when they can't<br/>  Find one, each day of the delightful year:<br/>Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,<br/>And--what is worst of all--won't let you go:<br/><br/>The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,<br/>  Or make a Werter of him in the end.<br/>No wonder then a purer soul should dread<br/>  This sort of chaste _liaison_ for a friend;<br/>It were much better to be wed or dead,<br/>  Than wear a heart a Woman loves to rend.<br/>'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,<br/>If that a _bonne fortune_ be really _bonne_.<br/><br/>And first, in the overflowing of her heart,<br/>  Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,<br/>She called her husband now and then apart,<br/>  And bade him counsel Juan.

the great little poet's wrong;<br/>His other maxim, _"Noscitur √† sociis,"_<br/>  Is much more to the purpose of his song;<br/>Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,<br/>  Unless good company be kept too long;<br/>But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,<br/>Thrice happy they who _have_ an occupation!<br/><br/>Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,<br/>  Eve made up millinery with fig leaves--<br/>The earliest knowledge from the Tree so knowing,<br/>  As far as I know, that the Church receives:<br/>And since that time it need not cost much showing,<br/>  That many of the ills o'er which Man grieves,<br/>And still more Women, spring from not employing<br/>Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.<br/><br/>And hence high life is oft a dreary void,<br/>  A rack of pleasures, where we must invent<br/>A something wherewithal to be annoyed.<br/>  Bards may sing what they please about _Content_;<br/>_Contented_, when translated, means but cloyed;<br/>  And hence arise the woes of Sentiment,<br/>Blue-devils--and Blue-stockings--and Romances<br/>Reduced to practice, and performed like dances.<br/><br/>I do declare, upon an affidavit,<br/>  Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;<br/>Nor, if unto the World I ever gave it,<br/>  Would some believe that such a tale had been:<br/>But such intent I never had, nor have it;<br/>  Some truths are better kept behind a screen,<br/>Especially when they would look like lies;<br/>I therefore deal in generalities.<br/><br/>"An oyster may be crossed in love"--and why?<br/>  Because he mopeth idly in his shell,<br/>And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,<br/>  Much as a monk may do within his cell:<br/>And _√†-propos_ of monks, their Piety<br/>  With Sloth hath found it difficult to dwell:<br/>Those vegetables of the Catholic creed<br/>Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.<br/><br/>O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,<br/>  Whose merit none enough can sing or say,<br/>Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,<br/>  Thou moral Washington of Africa!<br/>But there's another little thing, I own,<br/>  Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,<br/>And set the other half of Earth to rights;<br/>You have freed the _blacks_--now pray shut up the whites.<br/><br/>Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!<br/>  Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;<br/>Teach them that "sauce for goose is sauce for gander,"<br/>  And ask them how _they_ like to be in thrall?<br/>Shut up each high heroic Salamander,<br/>  Who eats fire gratis (since the pay's but small);<br/>Shut up--no, _not_ the King, but the Pavilion,<br/>Or else 't will cost us all another million.<br/><br/>Shut up the World at large, let Bedlam out;<br/>  And you will be perhaps surprised to find<br/>All things pursue exactly the same route,<br/>  As now with those of _soi-disant_ sound mind.<br/>This I could prove beyond a single doubt,<br/>  Were there a jot of sense among Mankind;<br/>But till that _point d'appui_ is found, alas!<br/>Like Archimedes, I leave Earth as 't was.<br/><br/>Our gentle Adeline had one defect--<br/>  Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;<br/>Her conduct had been perfectly correct,<br/>  As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.<br/>A wavering spirit may be easier wrecked,<br/>  Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a staunch one;<br/>But when the latter works its own undoing,<br/>Its inner crash is like an Earthquake's ruin.<br/><br/>She loved her Lord, or thought so; but _that_ love<br/>  Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,<br/>The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move<br/>  Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.<br/>She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,<br/>  No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:<br/>Their union was a model to behold,<br/>Serene and noble,--conjugal, but cold.<br/><br/>There was no great disparity of years,<br/>  Though much in temper;

the more so, as her breast<br/>Was not at first too readily impressed.<br/><br/>But when it was, she had that lurking Demon<br/>  Of double nature, and thus doubly named--<br/>Firmness yclept in Heroes, Kings, and seamen,<br/>  That is, when they succeed;

then how should I?<br/>  I think not she was _then_ in love with Juan:<br/>If so, she would have had the strength to fly<br/>  The wild sensation, unto her a new one:<br/>She merely felt a common sympathy<br/>  (I will not say it was a false or true one)<br/>In him, because she thought he was in danger,--<br/>Her husband's friend--her own--young--and a stranger.<br/><br/>She was, or thought she was, his friend--and this<br/>  Without the farce of Friendship, or romance<br/>Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss<br/>  Ladies who have studied Friendship but in France<br/>Or Germany, where people _purely_ kiss.<br/>  To thus much Adeline would not advance;<br/>But of such friendship as Man's may to Man be<br/>She was as capable as Woman can be.<br/><br/>No doubt the secret influence of the Sex<br/>  Will there, as also in the ties of blood,<br/>An innocent predominance annex,<br/>  And tune the concord to a finer mood.<br/>If free from Passion, which all Friendship checks,<br/>  And your true feelings fully understood,<br/>No friend like to a woman Earth discovers,<br/>So that you have not been nor will be lovers.<br/><br/>Love bears within its breast the very germ<br/>  Of Change;

that I should say so;<br/>They differ as wine differs from its label,<br/>  When once decanted;--I presume to guess so,<br/>But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,<br/>Till old, may undergo adulteration.<br/><br/>But Adeline was of the purest vintage,<br/>  The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet<br/>Bright as a new napoleon from its mintage,<br/>  Or glorious as a diamond richly set;<br/>A page where Time should hesitate to print age,<br/>  And for which Nature might forego her debt--<br/>Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't<br/>The luck of finding everybody solvent.<br/><br/>O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily<br/>  Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,<br/>Like a meek tradesman when approaching palely<br/>  Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:<br/>But oft denied, as Patience 'gins to fail, he<br/>  Advances with exasperated rap,<br/>And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,<br/>On ready money, or "a draft on Ransom."<br/><br/>Whate'er thou takest, spare awhile poor Beauty!<br/>  She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.<br/>What though she now and then may slip from duty,<br/>  The more's the reason why you ought to stay;<br/>Gaunt Gourmand!

I can't tell;<br/>  I wish she had: his book's the eleventh commandment,<br/>Which says, "Thou shall not marry," unless _well_:<br/>  This he (as far as I can understand) meant.<br/>'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell,<br/>  Nor canvass what "so eminent a hand" meant;<br/>But, certes, it conducts to lives ascetic,<br/>Or turning Marriage into Arithmetic.<br/><br/>But Adeline, who probably presumed<br/>  That Juan had enough of maintenance,<br/>Or _separate_ maintenance, in case 't was doomed--<br/>  As on the whole it is an even chance<br/>That bridegrooms, after they are fairly _groomed_,<br/>  May retrograde a little in the Dance<br/>Of Marriage--(which might form a painter's fame,<br/>Like Holbein's "Dance of Death"--but 't is the same)--<br/><br/>But Adeline determined Juan's wedding<br/>  In her own mind, and that's enough for Woman:<br/>But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,<br/>  Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman,<br/>And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.<br/>  She deemed his merits something more than common:<br/>All these were unobjectionable matches,<br/>And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.<br/><br/>There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,<br/>  That usual paragon, an only daughter,<br/>Who seemed the cream of Equanimity,<br/>  Till skimmed--and then there was some milk and water,<br/>With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,<br/>  Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?<br/>Love's riotous, but Marriage should have quiet,<br/>And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.<br/><br/>And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,<br/>  A dashing _demoiselle_ of good estate,<br/>Whose heart was fixed upon a star or blue string;<br/>  But whether English Dukes grew rare of late,<br/>Or that she had not harped upon the true string,<br/>  By which such Sirens can attract our great,<br/>She took up with some foreign younger brother,<br/>A Russ or Turk--the one's as good as t' other.<br/><br/>And then there was--but why should I go on,<br/>  Unless the ladies should go off?--there was<br/>Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,<br/>  Of the best class, and better than her class,--<br/>Aurora Raby, a young star who shone<br/>  O'er Life, too sweet an image for such glass,<br/>A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded,<br/>A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;<br/><br/>Rich, noble, but an orphan--left an only<br/>  Child to the care of guardians good and kind--<br/>But still her aspect had an air so lonely;<br/>  Blood is not water; and where shall we find<br/>Feelings of Youth like those which overthrown lie<br/>  By Death, when we are left, alas! behind,<br/>To feel, in friendless palaces, a home<br/>Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?<br/><br/>Early in years, and yet more infantine<br/>  In figure, she had something of Sublime<br/>In eyes which sadly shone, as Seraphs' shine.<br/>  All Youth--but with an aspect beyond Time;<br/>Radiant and grave--as pitying Man's decline;<br/>  Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,<br/>She looked as if she sat by Eden's door,<br/>And grieved for those who could return no more.<br/><br/>She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,<br/>  As far as her own gentle heart allowed,<br/>And deemed that fallen worship far more dear<br/>  Perhaps because 't was fallen: her Sires were proud<br/>Of deeds and days when they had filled the ear<br/>  Of nations, and had never bent or bowed<br/>To novel power; and as she was the last,<br/>She held their old faith and old feelings fast.<br/><br/>She gazed upon a World she scarcely knew,<br/>  As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,<br/>As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,<br/>  And kept her heart serene within its zone.<br/>There was awe in the homage which she drew;<br/>  Her Spirit seemed as seated on a throne<br/>Apart from the surrounding world, and strong<br/>In its own strength--most strange in one so young!<br/><br/>Now it so happened, in the catalogue<br/>  Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,<br/>Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue,<br/>  Beyond the charmers we have already cited;<br/>Her beauty also seemed to form no clog<br/>  Against her being mentioned as well fitted,<br/>By many virtues, to be worth the trouble<br/>Of single gentlemen who would be double.<br/><br/>And this omission, like that of the bust<br/>  Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,<br/>Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.<br/>  This he expressed half smiling and half serious;<br/>When Adeline replied with some disgust,<br/>  And with an air, to say the least, imperious,<br/>She marvelled "what he saw in such a baby<br/>As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?"<br/><br/>Juan rejoined--"She was a Catholic,<br/>  And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;<br/>Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,<br/>  And the Pope thunder excommunication,<br/>If--" But here Adeline, who seemed to pique<br/>  Herself extremely on the inoculation<br/>Of others with her own opinions, stated--<br/>As usual--the same reason which she late did.<br/><br/>And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,<br/>  If good, is none the worse for repetition;<br/>If bad, the best way's certainly to tease on,<br/>  And amplify: you lose much by concision,<br/>Whereas insisting in or out of season<br/>  Convinces all men, even a politician;<br/>Or--what is just the same--it wearies out.<br/>So the end's gained, what signifies the route?<br/><br/>_Why_ Adeline had this slight prejudice--<br/>  For prejudice it was--against a creature<br/>As pure, as Sanctity itself, from Vice,--<br/>  With all the added charm of form and feature,--<br/>For me appears a question far too nice,<br/>  Since Adeline was liberal by nature;<br/>But Nature's Nature, and has more caprices<br/>Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.<br/><br/>Perhaps she did not like the quiet way<br/>  With which Aurora on those baubles looked,<br/>Which charm most people in their earlier day:<br/>  For there are few things by Mankind less brooked,<br/>And Womankind too, if we so may say,<br/>  Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,<br/>Like "Antony's by C√¶sar," by the few<br/>Who look upon them as they ought to do.<br/><br/>It was not envy--Adeline had none;<br/>  Her place was far beyond it, and her mind:<br/>It was not scorn--which could not light on one<br/>  Whose greatest _fault_ was leaving few to find:<br/>It was not jealousy, I think--but shun<br/>  Following the _ignes fatui_ of Mankind:<br/>It was not----but 't is easier far, alas!<br/>To say what it was _not_ than what it was.<br/><br/>Little Aurora deemed she was the theme<br/>  Of such discussion. She was there a guest;<br/>A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream<br/>  Of Rank and Youth, though purer than the rest,<br/>Which flowed on for a moment in the beam<br/>  Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.<br/>Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--<br/>She had so much, or little, of the child.<br/><br/>The dashing and proud air of Adeline<br/>  Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze<br/>Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,<br/>  Then turned unto the stars for loftier rays.<br/>Juan was something she could not divine,<br/>  Being no Sibyl in the new world's ways;<br/>Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,<br/>Because she did not pin her faith on feature.<br/><br/>His fame too,--for he had that kind of fame<br/>  Which sometimes plays the deuce with Womankind,<br/>A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,<br/>  Half virtues and whole vices being combined;<br/>Faults which attract because they are not tame;<br/>  Follies tricked out so brightly that they blind:--<br/>These seals upon her wax made no impression,<br/>Such was her coldness or her self-possession.<br/><br/>Juan knew nought of such a character--<br/>  High, yet resembling not his lost Haid√©e;<br/>Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:<br/>  The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,<br/>More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,<br/>  Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,<br/>Nor would be thus:--the difference in them<br/>Was such as lies between a flower and gem.<br/><br/>Having wound up with this sublime comparison,<br/>  Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,<br/>And, as my friend Scott says, "I sound my warison;"<br/>  Scott, the superlative of my comparative--<br/>Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,<br/>  Serf--Lord--Man, with such skill as none would share it, if<br/>There had not been one Shakespeare and Voltaire,<br/>Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.<br/><br/>I say, in my slight way I may proceed<br/>  To play upon the surface of Humanity.<br/>I write the World, nor care if the World read,<br/>  At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.<br/>My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed<br/>  More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I<br/>Thought that it might turn out so--_now I know it_,<br/>But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.<br/><br/>The conference or congress (for it ended<br/>  As Congresses of late do) of the Lady<br/>Adeline and Don Juan rather blended<br/>  Some acids with the sweets--for she was heady;<br/>But, ere the matter could be marred or mended,<br/>  The silvery bell rang, not for "dinner ready,"<br/>But for that hour, called half-hour, given to dress,<br/>Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.<br/><br/>Great things were now to be achieved at table,<br/>  With massy plate for armour, knives and forks<br/>For weapons; but what Muse since Homer's able<br/>  (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)<br/>To draw up in array a single day-bill<br/>  Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,<br/>In soups or sauces, or a sole _rago√∫t_,<br/>Than witches, b--ches, or physicians, brew.<br/><br/>There was a goodly "soupe √† la _bonne femme_"<br/>  Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,<br/>A turbot for relief of those who cram,<br/>  Relieved with "dindon √† la P√©rigeux;"<br/>There also was----the sinner that I am!<br/>  How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?--<br/>"Soupe √† la Beauveau," whose relief was dory,<br/>Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.<br/><br/>But I must crowd all into one grand mess<br/>  Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,<br/>My Muse would run much more into excess,<br/>  Than when some squeamish people deem her frail;<br/>But though a _bonne vivante_, I must confess<br/>  Her stomach's not her peccant part; this tale<br/>However doth require some slight refection,<br/>Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.<br/><br/>Fowls "√† la Cond√©," slices eke of salmon,<br/>  With "sauces G√©nevoises," and haunch of venison;<br/>Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon--<br/>  A man like whom I hope we sha'n't see many soon;<br/>They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,<br/>  Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;<br/>And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,<br/>As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.<br/><br/>Then there was God knows what "√† l'Allemande,"<br/>  "A l'Espagnole," "timballe," and "salpicon"--<br/>With things I can't withstand or understand,<br/>  Though swallowed with much zest upon the whole;<br/>And _"entremets"_ to piddle with at hand,<br/>  Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;<br/>While great Lucullus' _Robe triumphal_ muffles--<br/>(_There's fame_)--young partridge fillets, decked with truffles.<br/><br/>What are the _fillets_ on the Victor's brow<br/>  To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch<br/>Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?<br/>  Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?<br/>Gone to where Victories must like dinners go.<br/>  Farther I shall not follow the research:<br/>But oh! ye modern Heroes with your cartridges,<br/>When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?<br/><br/>Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,<br/>  Followed by "petits puits d'amour"--a dish<br/>Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,<br/>  So every one may dress it to his wish,<br/>According to the best of dictionaries,<br/>  Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;<br/>But even, sans _confitures_, it no less true is,<br/>There's pretty picking in those _petits puits_.<br/><br/>The mind is lost in mighty contemplation<br/>  Of intellect expanded on two courses;<br/>And Indigestion's grand multiplication<br/>  Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.<br/>Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,<br/>  That cookery could have called forth such resources,<br/>As form a science and a nomenclature<br/>From out the commonest demands of Nature?<br/><br/>The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;<br/>  The diners of celebrity dined well;<br/>The ladies with more moderation mingled<br/>  In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;<br/>Also the younger men too: for a springald<br/>  Can't, like ripe Age, in _gourmandise_ excel,<br/>But thinks less of good eating than the whisper<br/>(When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.<br/><br/>Alas! I must leave undescribed the _gibier_,<br/>  The _salmi_, the _consomm√©_, the _pur√©e_,<br/>All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber<br/>  Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:<br/>I must not introduce even a spare rib here,<br/>  "Bubble and squeak" would spoil my liquid lay:<br/>But I have dined, and must forego, alas!<br/>The chaste description even of a "b√©casse;"<br/><br/>And fruits, and ice, and all that Art refines<br/>  From Nature for the service of the _go√ªt_--<br/>_Taste_ or the _gout_,--pronounce it as inclines<br/>  Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;<br/>But _after_, there are sometimes certain signs<br/>  Which prove plain English truer of the two.<br/>Hast ever _had_ the _gout_? I have not had it--<br/>But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.<br/><br/>The simple olives, best allies of wine,<br/>  Must I pass over in my bill of fare?<br/>I must, although a favourite _plat_ of mine<br/>  In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, everywhere:<br/>On them and bread 'twas oft my luck to dine--<br/>  The grass my table-cloth, in open air,<br/>On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,<br/>Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.<br/><br/>Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and fowl,<br/>  And vegetables, all in masquerade,<br/>The guests were placed according to their roll,<br/>  But various as the various meats displayed:<br/>Don Juan sat next an "√† l'Espagnole"--<br/>  No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;<br/>But so far like a lady, that 'twas drest<br/>Superbly, and contained a world of zest.<br/><br/>By some odd chance too, he was placed between<br/>  Aurora and the Lady Adeline--<br/>A situation difficult, I ween,<br/>  For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.<br/>Also the conference which we have seen<br/>  Was not such as to encourage him to shine,<br/>For Adeline, addressing few words to him,<br/>With two transcendent eyes seemed to look through him.<br/><br/>I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:<br/>  This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things<br/>Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,<br/>  Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.<br/>Like that same mystic music of the spheres,<br/>  Which no one hears, so loudly though it rings,<br/>'Tis wonderful how oft the sex have heard<br/>Long dialogues--which passed without a word!<br/><br/>Aurora sat with that indifference<br/>  Which piques a _preux chevalier_--as it ought:<br/>Of all offences that's the worst offence,<br/>  Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.<br/>Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,<br/>  Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;<br/>Like a good ship entangled among ice--<br/>And after so much excellent advice.<br/><br/>To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,<br/>  Or something which was nothing, as Urbanity<br/>Required. Aurora scarcely looked aside,<br/>  Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.<br/>The Devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?<br/>  Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?<br/>Heaven knows! But Adeline's malicious eyes<br/>Sparkled with her successful prophecies,<br/><br/>And looked as much as if to say, "I said it;"<br/>  A kind of triumph I'll not recommend,<br/>Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,<br/>  Both in the case of lover and of friend,<br/>Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,<br/>  To bring what was a jest to a serious end:<br/>For all men prophesy what _is_ or _was_,<br/>And hate those who won't let them come to pass.<br/><br/>Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,<br/>  Slight but select, and just enough to express,<br/>To females of perspicuous comprehensions,<br/>  That he would rather make them more than less.<br/>Aurora at the last (so history mentions,<br/>  Though probably much less a fact than guess)<br/>So far relaxed her thoughts from their sweet prison,<br/>As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.<br/><br/>From answering she began to question: this<br/>  With her was rare; and Adeline, who as yet<br/>Thought her predictions went not much amiss,<br/>  Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--<br/>So very difficult, they say, it is<br/>  To keep extremes from meeting, when once set<br/>In motion; but she here too much refined--<br/>Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.<br/><br/>But Juan had a sort of winning way,<br/>  A proud humility, if such there be,<br/>Which showed such deference to what females say,<br/>  As if each charming word were a decree.<br/>His tact, too, tempered him from grave to gay,<br/>  And taught him when to be reserved or free:<br/>He had the art of drawing people out,<br/>Without their seeing what he was about.<br/><br/>Aurora, who in her indifference<br/>  Confounded him in common with the crowd<br/>Of flatterers, though she deemed he had more sense<br/>  Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--<br/>Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)<br/>  To feel that flattery which attracts the proud<br/>Rather by deference than compliment,<br/>And wins even by a delicate dissent.<br/><br/>And then he had good looks;--that point was carried<br/>  _Nem. con._ amongst the women, which I grieve<br/>To say leads oft to _crim. con._ with the married--<br/>  A case which to the juries we may leave,<br/>Since with digressions we too long have tarried.<br/>  Now though we know of old that looks deceive,<br/>And always have done,--somehow these good looks<br/>Make more impression than the best of books.<br/><br/>Aurora, who looked more on books than faces,<br/>  Was very young, although so very sage,<br/>Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,<br/>  Especially upon a printed page.<br/>But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,<br/>  Has not the natural stays of strict old age;<br/>And Socrates, that model of all duty,<br/>Owned to a _penchant_, though discreet, for beauty.<br/><br/>And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,<br/>  But innocently so, as Socrates;<br/>And really, if the Sage sublime and Attic<br/>  At seventy years had phantasies like these,<br/>Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic<br/>  Has shown, I know not why they should displease<br/>In virgins--always in a modest way,<br/>Observe,--for that with me's a _sine qu√¢_.<br/><br/>Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke<br/>  (See Littleton), whene'er I have expressed<br/>Opinions two, which at first sight may look<br/>  Twin opposites, the second is the best.<br/>Perhaps I have a third too, in a nook,<br/>  Or none at all--which seems a sorry jest:<br/>But if a writer should be quite consistent,<br/>How could he possibly show things existent?<br/><br/>If people contradict themselves, can I<br/>  Help contradicting them, and everybody,<br/>Even my veracious self?--But that's a lie:<br/>  I never did so, never will--how should I?<br/>He who doubts all things nothing can deny:<br/>  Truth's fountains may be clear--her streams are muddy,<br/>And cut through such canals of contradiction,<br/>That she must often navigate o'er fiction.<br/><br/>Apologue, Fable, Poesy, and Parable,<br/>  Are false, but may be rendered also true,<br/>By those who sow them in a land that's arable:<br/>  'Tis wonderful what Fable will not do!<br/>'Tis said it makes Reality more bearable:<br/>  But what's Reality? Who has its clue?<br/>Philosophy? No; she too much rejects.<br/>Religion? _Yes_; but which of all her sects?<br/><br/>Some millions must be wrong, that's pretty clear;<br/>  Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.<br/>God help us! Since we have need on our career<br/>  To keep our holy beacons always bright,<br/>'Tis time that some new prophet should appear,<br/>  Or _old_ indulge man with a second sight.<br/>Opinions wear out in some thousand years,<br/>Without a small refreshment from the spheres.<br/><br/>But here again, why will I thus entangle<br/>  Myself with Metaphysics? None can hate<br/>So much as I do any kind of wrangle;<br/>  And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,<br/>I always knock my head against some angle<br/>  About the present, past, or future state:<br/>Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,<br/>For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.<br/><br/>But though I am a temperate theologian,<br/>  And also meek as a metaphysician,<br/>Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,<br/>  As Eldon on a lunatic commission,--<br/>In politics my duty is to show John<br/>  Bull something of the lower world's condition.<br/>It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,<br/>To see men let these scoundrel Sovereigns break law.<br/><br/>But Politics, and Policy, and Piety,<br/>  Are topics which I sometimes introduce,<br/>Not only for the sake of their variety,<br/>  But as subservient to a moral use;<br/>Because my business is to _dress_ society,<br/>  And stuff with _sage_ that very verdant goose.<br/>And now, that we may furnish with some matter all<br/>Tastes, we are going to try the Supernatural.<br/><br/>And now I will give up all argument;<br/>  And positively, henceforth, no temptation<br/>Shall "fool me to the top up of my bent:"--<br/>  Yes, I'll begin a thorough reformation.<br/>Indeed, I never knew what people meant<br/>  By deeming that my Muse's conversation<br/>Was dangerous;--I think she is as harmless<br/>As some who labour more and yet may charm less.<br/><br/>Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?<br/>  No; but you have heard--I understand--be dumb!<br/>And don't regret the time you may have lost,<br/>  For you have got that pleasure still to come:<br/>And do not think I mean to sneer at most<br/>  Of these things, or by ridicule benumb<br/>That source of the Sublime and the Mysterious:--<br/>For certain reasons my belief is serious.<br/><br/>Serious? You laugh;--you may: that will I not;<br/>  My smiles must be sincere or not at all.<br/>I say I do believe a haunted spot<br/>  Exists--and where? That shall I not recall,<br/>Because I'd rather it should be forgot,<br/>  "Shadows the soul of Richard" may appal.<br/>In short, upon that subject I've some qualms very<br/>Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.<br/><br/>The night--(I sing by night--sometimes an owl,<br/>  And now and then a nightingale)--is dim,<br/>And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl<br/>  Rattles around me her discordant hymn:<br/>Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl--<br/>  I wish to Heaven they would not look so grim;<br/>The dying embers dwindle in the grate--<br/>I think too that I have sat up too late:<br/><br/>And therefore, though 'tis by no means my way<br/>  To rhyme at noon--when I have other things<br/>To think of, if I ever think--I say<br/>  I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,<br/>And prudently postpone, until mid-day,<br/>  Treating a topic which, alas! but brings<br/>Shadows;--but you must be in my condition,<br/>Before you learn to call this superstition.<br/><br/>Between two worlds Life hovers like a star,<br/>  'Twixt Night and Morn, upon the horizon's verge.<br/>How little do we know that which we are!<br/>  How less what we may be! The eternal surge<br/>Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar<br/>  Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,<br/>Lashed from the foam of ages; while the graves<br/>Of Empires heave but like some passing waves.<br/><br/>CANTO THE SIXTEENTH.<br/><br/>The antique Persians taught three useful things,<br/>  To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth,<br/>This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings--<br/>  A mode adopted since by modern youth.<br/>Bows have they, generally with two strings;<br/>  Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;<br/>At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,<br/>But draw the long bow better now than ever.<br/><br/>The cause of this effect, or this defect,--<br/>  "For this effect defective comes by cause,"--<br/>Is what I have not leisure to inspect;<br/>  But this I must say in my own applause,<br/>Of all the Muses that I recollect,<br/>  Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws<br/>In some things, mine's beyond all contradiction<br/>The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.<br/><br/>And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats<br/>  From anything, this Epic will contain<br/>A wilderness of the most rare conceits,<br/>  Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.<br/>'Tis true there be some bitters with the sweets,<br/>  Yet mixed so slightly, that you can't complain,<br/>But wonder they so few are, since my tale is<br/>"_De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis._"<br/><br/>But of all truths which she has told, the most<br/>  True is that which she is about to tell.<br/>I said it was a story of a ghost--<br/>  What then? I only know it so befell.<br/>Have you explored the limits of the coast,<br/>  Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?<br/>'Tis time to strike such puny doubters dumb as<br/>The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.<br/><br/>Some people would impose now with authority,<br/>  Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;<br/>Men whose historical superiority<br/>  Is always greatest at a miracle.<br/>But Saint Augustine has the great priority,<br/>  Who bids all men believe the impossible,<br/>_Because 'tis so._ Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he<br/>Quiets at once with "_quia impossibile._"<br/><br/>And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;<br/>  Believe:--if 'tis improbable, you _must_,<br/>And if it is impossible, you _shall_:<br/>  'Tis always best to take things upon trust.<br/>I do not speak profanely to recall<br/>  Those holier Mysteries which the wise and just<br/>Receive as Gospel, and which grow more rooted,<br/>As all truths must, the more they are disputed:<br/><br/>I merely mean to say what Johnson said,<br/>  That in the course of some six thousand years,<br/>All nations have believed that from the dead<br/>  A visitant at intervals appears:<br/>And what is strangest upon this strange head,<br/>  Is, that whatever bar the reason rears<br/>'Gainst such belief, there's something stronger still<br/>In its behalf--let those deny who will.<br/><br/>The dinner and the _soir√©e_ too were done,<br/>  The supper too discussed, the dames admired,<br/>The banqueteers had dropped off one by one--<br/>  The song was silent, and the dance expired:<br/>The last thin petticoats were vanished, gone<br/>  Like fleecy clouds into the sky retired,<br/>And nothing brighter gleamed through the saloon<br/>Than dying tapers--and the peeping moon.<br/><br/>The evaporation of a joyous day<br/>  Is like the last glass of champagne, without<br/>The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;<br/>  Or like a system coupled with a doubt;<br/>Or like a soda bottle when its spray<br/>  Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;<br/>Or like a billow left by storms behind,<br/>Without the animation of the wind;<br/><br/>Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,<br/>  Or none; or like--like nothing that I know<br/>Except itself;--such is the human breast;<br/>  A thing, of which similitudes can show<br/>No real likeness,--like the old Tyrian vest<br/>  Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,<br/>If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.<br/>So perish every Tyrant's robe piece-meal!<br/><br/>But next to dressing for a rout or ball,<br/>  Undressing is a woe; our _robe de chambre_<br/>May sit like that of Nessus, and recall<br/>  Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.<br/>Titus exclaimed, "I've lost a day!" Of all<br/>  The nights and days most people can remember,<br/>(I have had of both, some not to be disdained,)<br/>I wish they'd state how many they have gained.<br/><br/>And Juan, on retiring for the night,<br/>  Felt restless, and perplexed, and compromised:<br/>He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright<br/>  Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;<br/>If he had known exactly his own plight,<br/>  He probably would have philosophised:<br/>A great resource to all, and ne'er denied<br/>Till wanted; therefore Juan only sighed.<br/><br/>He sighed;--the next resource is the full moon,<br/>  Where all sighs are deposited; and now<br/>It happened luckily, the chaste orb shone<br/>  As clear as such a climate will allow;<br/>And Juan's mind was in the proper tone<br/>  To hail her with the apostrophe--"O thou!"<br/>Of amatory egotism the _Tuism_,<br/>Which further to explain would be a truism.<br/><br/>But Lover, Poet, or Astronomer--<br/>  Shepherd, or swain--whoever may behold,<br/>Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her;<br/>  Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold<br/>Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);<br/>  Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;<br/>The Ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,<br/>And also hearts--if there be truth in lays.<br/><br/>Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed<br/>  For contemplation rather than his pillow:<br/>The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,<br/>  Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,<br/>With all the mystery by midnight caused:<br/>  Below his window waved (of course) willow;<br/>And he stood gazing out on the cascade<br/>That flashed and after darkened in the shade.<br/><br/>Upon his table or his toilet,--_which_<br/>  Of these is not exactly ascertained,--<br/>(I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch<br/>  Of nicety, where a fact is to be gained,)<br/>A lamp burned high, while he leant from a niche,<br/>  Where many a Gothic ornament remained,<br/>In chiselled stone and painted glass, and all<br/>That Time has left our fathers of their Hall.<br/><br/>Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw<br/>  His chamber door wide open--and went forth<br/>Into a gallery of a sombre hue,<br/>  Long, furnished with old pictures of great worth,<br/>Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,<br/>  As doubtless should be people of high birth;<br/>But by dim lights the portraits of the dead<br/>Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.<br/><br/>The forms of the grim Knight and pictured Saint<br/>  Look living in the moon; and as you turn<br/>Backward and forward to the echoes faint<br/>  Of your own footsteps--voices from the Urn<br/>Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint<br/>  Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,<br/>As if to ask how you can dare to keep<br/>A vigil there, where all but Death should sleep.<br/><br/>And the pale smile of Beauties in the grave,<br/>  The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,<br/>Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave<br/>  Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams<br/>On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,<br/>  But Death is imaged in their shadowy beams.<br/>A picture is the past; even ere its frame<br/>Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.<br/><br/>As Juan mused on Mutability,<br/>  Or on his Mistress--terms synonymous--<br/>No sound except the echo of his sigh<br/>  Or step ran sadly through that antique house;<br/>When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,<br/>  A supernatural agent--or a mouse,<br/>Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass<br/>Most people as it plays along the arras.<br/><br/>It was no mouse--but lo! a monk, arrayed<br/>  In cowl and beads, and dusky garb, appeared,<br/>Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,<br/>  With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;<br/>His garments only a slight murmur made;<br/>  He moved as shadowy as the Sisters weird,<br/>But slowly; and as he passed Juan by,<br/>Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.<br/><br/>Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint<br/>  Of such a Spirit in these halls of old,<br/>But thought, like most men, that there was nothing in 't<br/>  Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,<br/>Coined from surviving Superstition's mint,<br/>  Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,<br/>But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.<br/>And did he see this? or was it a vapour?<br/><br/>Once, twice, thrice passed, repassed--the thing of air,<br/>  Or earth beneath, or Heaven, or t' other place;<br/>And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,<br/>  Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base<br/>As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair<br/>  Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;<br/>He taxed his tongue for words, which were not granted,<br/>To ask the reverend person what he wanted.<br/><br/>The third time, after a still longer pause,<br/>  The shadow passed away--but where? the hall<br/>Was long, and thus far there was no great cause<br/>  To think his vanishing unnatural:<br/>Doors there were many, through which, by the laws<br/>  Of physics, bodies whether short or tall<br/>Might come or go; but Juan could not state<br/>Through which the Spectre seemed to evaporate.<br/><br/>He stood--how long he knew not, but it seemed<br/>  An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes<br/>Strained on the spot where first the figure gleamed<br/>  Then by degrees recalled his energies,<br/>And would have passed the whole off as a dream,<br/>  But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,<br/>Waking already, and returned at length<br/>Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.<br/><br/>All there was as he left it: still his taper<br/>  Burned, and not _blue_, as modest tapers use,<br/>Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;<br/>  He rubbed his eyes, and they did not refuse<br/>Their office: he took up an old newspaper;<br/>  The paper was right easy to peruse;<br/>He read an article the King attacking,<br/>And a long eulogy of "Patent Blacking."<br/><br/>This savoured of this world; but his hand shook:<br/>  He shut his door, and after having read<br/>A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,<br/>  Undressed, and rather slowly went to bed.<br/>There, couched all snugly on his pillow's nook,<br/>  With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;<br/>And though it was no opiate, slumber crept<br/>Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.<br/><br/>He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,<br/>  Pondered upon his visitant or vision,<br/>And whether it ought not to be disclosed,<br/>  At risk of being quizzed for superstition.<br/>The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:<br/>  In the mean time, his valet, whose precision<br/>Was great, because his master brooked no less,<br/>Knocked to inform him it was time to dress.<br/><br/>He dressed; and like young people he was wont<br/>  To take some trouble with his toilet, but<br/>This morning rather spent less time upon 't;<br/>  Aside his very mirror soon was put;<br/>His curls fell negligently o'er his front,<br/>  His clothes were not curbed to their usual cut,<br/>His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied<br/>Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.<br/><br/>And when he walked down into the Saloon,<br/>  He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,<br/>Which he perhaps had not discovered soon,<br/>  Had it not happened scalding hot to be,<br/>Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;<br/>  So much _distrait_ he was, that all could see<br/>That something was the matter--Adeline<br/>The first--but _what_ she could not well divine.<br/><br/>She looked, and saw him pale, and turned as pale<br/>  Herself; then hastily looked down, and muttered<br/>Something, but what's not stated in my tale.<br/>  Lord Henry said, his muffin was ill buttered;<br/>The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke played with her veil,<br/>  And looked at Juan hard, but nothing uttered.<br/>Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes<br/>Surveyed him with a kind of calm surprise.<br/><br/>But seeing him all cold and silent still,<br/>  And everybody wondering more or less,<br/>Fair Adeline inquired, "If he were ill?"<br/>  He started, and said, "Yes--no--rather--yes."<br/>The family physician had great skill,<br/>  And being present, now began to express<br/>His readiness to feel his pulse and tell<br/>The cause, but Juan said, he was "quite well."<br/><br/>"Quite well; yes,--no."--These answers were mysterious,<br/>  And yet his looks appeared to sanction both,<br/>However they might savour of delirious;<br/>  Something like illness of a sudden growth<br/>Weighed on his spirit, though by no means serious:<br/>  But for the rest, as he himself seemed both<br/>To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted<br/>It was not the physician that he wanted.<br/><br/>Lord Henry, who had now discussed his chocolate,<br/>  Also the muffin whereof he complained,<br/>Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,<br/>  At which he marvelled, since it had not rained;<br/>Then asked her Grace what news were of the Duke of late?<br/>  _Her_ Grace replied, _his_ Grace was rather pained<br/>With some slight, light, hereditary twinges<br/>Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.<br/><br/>Then Henry turned to Juan, and addressed<br/>  A few words of condolence on his state:<br/>"You look," quoth he, "as if you had had your rest<br/>  Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late."<br/>"What Friar?" said Juan; and he did his best<br/>  To put the question with an air sedate,<br/>Or careless; but the effort was not valid<br/>To hinder him from growing still more pallid.<br/><br/>"Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?<br/>  The Spirit of these walls?"--"In truth not I."<br/>"Why Fame--but Fame you know's sometimes a liar--<br/>  Tells an odd story, of which by and by:<br/>Whether with time the Spectre has grown shyer,<br/>  Or that our Sires had a more gifted eye<br/>For such sights, though the tale is half believed,<br/>The Friar of late has not been oft perceived.<br/><br/>"The last time was----"--"I pray," said Adeline--<br/>  (Who watched the changes of Don Juan's brow,<br/>And from its context thought she could divine<br/>  Connections stronger than he chose to avow<br/>With this same legend)--"if you but design<br/>  To jest, you'll choose some other theme just now,<br/>Because the present tale has oft been told,<br/>And is not much improved by growing old."<br/><br/>"Jest!" quoth Milor; "why, Adeline, you know<br/>  That we ourselves--'twas in the honey moon<br/>Saw----"--"Well, no matter, 'twas so long ago;<br/>  But, come, I'll set your story to a tune."<br/>Graceful as Dian when she draws her bow,<br/>  She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon<br/>As touched, and plaintively began to play<br/>The air of "'Twas a Friar of Orders Gray."<br/><br/>"But add the words," cried Henry, "which you made;<br/>  For Adeline is half a poetess,"<br/>Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.<br/>  Of course the others could not but express<br/>In courtesy their wish to see displayed<br/>  By one _three_ talents, for there were no less--<br/>The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once,<br/>Could hardly be united by a dunce.<br/><br/>After some fascinating hesitation,--<br/>  The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,<br/>I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--<br/>  Fair Adeline, with eyes fixed on the ground<br/>At first, then kindling into animation,<br/>  Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,<br/>And sang with much simplicity,--a merit<br/>Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.<br/><br/>Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<br/>  Who sitteth by Norman stone,<br/>For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,<br/>  And his mass of the days that are gone.<br/>When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,<br/>  Made Norman Church his prey,<br/>And expelled the friars, one friar still<br/>Would not be driven away.<br/><br/>Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,<br/>  To turn church lands to lay,<br/>With sword in hand, and torch to light<br/>  Their walls, if they said nay;<br/>A monk remained, unchased, unchained,<br/>  And he did not seem formed of clay,<br/>For he's seen in the porch, and he's seen in the church,<br/>Though he is not seen by day.<br/><br/>And whether for good, or whether for ill,<br/>  It is not mine to say;<br/>But still with the house of Amundeville<br/>  He abideth night and day.<br/>By the marriage-bed of their lords, 'tis said,<br/>  He flits on the bridal eve;<br/>And 'tis held as faith, to their bed of Death<br/>He comes--but not to grieve.<br/><br/>When an heir is born, he's heard to mourn,<br/>  And when aught is to befall<br/>That ancient line, in the pale moonshine<br/>  He walks from hall to hall.<br/>His form you may trace, but not his face,<br/>  'Tis shadowed by his cowl;<br/>But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,<br/>And they seem of a parted soul.<br/><br/>But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<br/>  He still retains his sway,<br/>For he is yet the Church's heir,<br/>  Whoever may be the lay.<br/>Amundeville is Lord by day,<br/>  But the monk is Lord by night;<br/>Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal<br/>To question that Friar's right.<br/><br/>Say nought to him as he walks the Hall,<br/>  And he'll say nought to you;<br/>He sweeps along in his dusky pall,<br/>  As o'er the grass the dew.<br/>Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;<br/>  Heaven sain him! fair or foul,--<br/>And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,<br/>Let ours be for his soul.<br/><br/>The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires<br/>  Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;<br/>And the pause followed, which when song expires<br/>  Pervades a moment those who listen round;<br/>And then of course the circle much admires,<br/>  Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,<br/>The tones, the feeling, and the execution,<br/>To the performer's diffident confusion.<br/><br/>Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,<br/>  As if she rated such accomplishment<br/>As the mere pastime of an idle day,<br/>  Pursued an instant for her own content,<br/>Would now and then as 'twere _without_ display,<br/>  Yet _with_ display in fact, at times relent<br/>To such performances with haughty smile,<br/>To show she _could_, if it were worth her while.<br/><br/>Now this (but we will whisper it aside)<br/>  Was--pardon the pedantic illustration--<br/>Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,<br/>  As did the Cynic on some like occasion;<br/>Deeming the sage would be much mortified,<br/>  Or thrown into a philosophic passion,<br/>For a spoilt carpet--but the "Attic Bee"<br/>Was much consoled by his own repartee.<br/><br/>Thus Adeline would throw into the shade<br/>  (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,<br/>What dilettanti do with vast parade)<br/>  Their sort of _half profession_; for it grows<br/>To something like this when too oft displayed;<br/>  And that it is so, everybody knows,<br/>Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,<br/>Show off--to please their company or mother.<br/><br/>Oh! the long evenings of duets and trios!<br/>  The admirations and the speculations;<br/>The "Mamma Mia's!" and the "Amor Mio's!"<br/>  The "Tanti palpiti's" on such occasions:<br/>The "Lasciami's," and quavering "Addio's,"<br/>  Amongst our own most musical of nations!<br/>With "Tu mi chamas's" from Portingale,<br/>To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.<br/><br/>In Babylon's _bravuras_--as the Home-<br/>  Heart-Ballads of Green Erin or Grey Highlands,<br/>That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam<br/>  O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,<br/>The calentures of music which o'ercome<br/>  All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,<br/>No more to be beheld but in such visions--<br/>Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.<br/><br/>She also had a twilight tinge of "_Blue_,"<br/>  Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,<br/>Made epigrams occasionally too<br/>  Upon her friends, as everybody ought.<br/>But still from that sublimer azure hue,<br/>  So much the present dye, she was remote;<br/>Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,<br/>And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.<br/><br/>Aurora--since we are touching upon taste,<br/>  Which now-a-days is the thermometer<br/>By whose degrees all characters are classed--<br/>  Was more Shakespearian, if I do not err.<br/>The worlds beyond this World's perplexing waste<br/>  Had more of her existence, for in her<br/>There was a depth of feeling to embrace<br/>Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.<br/><br/>Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,<br/>  The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,<br/>If she had any, was upon her face,<br/>  And that was of a fascinating kind.<br/>A little turn for mischief you might trace<br/>  Also thereon,--but that's not much; we find<br/>Few females without some such gentle leaven,<br/>For fear we should suppose us quite in Heaven.<br/><br/>I have not heard she was at all poetic,<br/>  Though once she was seen reading the _Bath Guide_,<br/>And Hayley's _Triumphs_, which she deemed pathetic,<br/>  Because she said _her temper_ had been tried<br/>So much, the bard had really been prophetic<br/>  Of what she had gone through with--since a bride.<br/>But of all verse, what most ensured her praise<br/>Were sonnets to herself, or _bouts rim√©s_.<br/><br/>'Twere difficult to say what was the object<br/>  Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay<br/>To bear on what appeared to her the subject<br/>  Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.<br/>Perhaps she merely had the simple project<br/>  To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;<br/>Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,<br/>Though why I cannot say--at least this minute.<br/><br/>But so far the immediate effect<br/>  Was to restore him to his self-propriety,<br/>A thing quite necessary to the elect,<br/>  Who wish to take the tone of their society:<br/>In which you cannot be too circumspect,<br/>  Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,<br/>But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,<br/>On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.<br/><br/>And therefore Juan now began to rally<br/>  His spirits, and without more explanation<br/>To jest upon such themes in many a sally.<br/>  Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,<br/>With various similar remarks to tally,<br/>  But wished for a still more detailed narration<br/>Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,<br/>About the present family's deaths and wooings.<br/><br/>Of these few could say more than has been said;<br/>  They passed as such things do, for superstition<br/>With some, while others, who had more in dread<br/>  The theme, half credited the strange tradition;<br/>And much was talked on all sides on that head:<br/>  But Juan, when cross-questioned on the vision,<br/>Which some supposed (though he had not avowed it)<br/>Had stirred him, answered in a way to cloud it.<br/><br/>And then, the mid-day having worn to one,<br/>  The company prepared to separate;<br/>Some to their several pastimes, or to none,<br/>  Some wondering 'twas so early, some so late.<br/>There was a goodly match too, to be run<br/>  Between some greyhounds on my Lord's estate,<br/>And a young race-horse of old pedigree,<br/>Matched for the spring, whom several went to see.<br/><br/>There was a picture-dealer who had brought<br/>  A special Titian, warranted original,<br/>So precious that it was not to be bought,<br/>  Though Princes the possessor were besieging all--<br/>The King himself had cheapened it, but thought<br/>  The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all<br/>His subjects by his gracious acceptation)--<br/>Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.<br/><br/>But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,--<br/>  The friend of Artists, if not Arts,--the owner,<br/>With motives the most classical and pure,<br/>  So that he would have been the very donor,<br/>Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,<br/>  So much he deemed his patronage an honour,<br/>Had brought the _capo d'opera_, not for sale,<br/>But for his judgment--never known to fail.<br/><br/>There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic<br/>  Bricklayer of Babel, called an architect,<br/>Brought to survey these grey walls which, though so thick,<br/>  Might have from Time acquired some slight defect;<br/>Who, after rummaging the Abbey through thick<br/>  And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect<br/>New buildings of correctest conformation,<br/>And throw down old--which he called _restoration_.<br/><br/>The cost would be a trifle--an "old song,"<br/>  Set to some thousands ('tis the usual burden<br/>Of that same tune, when people hum it long)--<br/>  The price would speedily repay its worth in<br/>An edifice no less sublime than strong,<br/>  By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in<br/>Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,<br/>For Gothic daring shown in English money.<br/><br/>There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage<br/>  Lord Henry wished to raise for a new purchase;<br/>Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,<br/>  And one on tithes, which sure as Discord's torches,<br/>Kindling Religion till she throws down _her_ gage,<br/>  "Untying" squires "to fight against the churches;"<br/>There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,<br/>For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.<br/><br/>There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,<br/>  Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;<br/>There was a country girl in a close cap<br/>  And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since--<br/>Since--since--in youth, I had the sad mishap--<br/>  But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):<br/>That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,<br/>Presents the problem of a double figure.<br/><br/>A reel within a bottle is a mystery,<br/>  One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;<br/>Therefore the present piece of natural history<br/>  I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;<br/>And merely state, though not for the Consistory,<br/>  Lord Henry was a Justice, and that Scout<br/>The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,<br/>Had bagged this poacher upon Nature's manor.<br/><br/>Now Justices of Peace must judge all pieces<br/>  Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game<br/>And morals of the country from caprices<br/>  Of those who have not a licence for the same;<br/>And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,<br/>  Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:<br/>Preserving partridges and pretty wenches<br/>Are puzzles to the most precautions benches.<br/><br/>The present culprit was extremely pale,<br/>  Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red<br/>By nature, as in higher dames less hale<br/>  'Tis white, at least when they just rise from bed.<br/>Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,<br/>  Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,<br/>And knew no better in her immorality<br/>Than to wax white--for blushes are for quality.<br/><br/>Her black, bright, downcast, yet _espi√®gle_ eye,<br/>  Had gathered a large tear into its corner,<br/>Which the poor thing at times essayed to dry,<br/>  For she was not a sentimental mourner<br/>Parading all her sensibility,<br/>  Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,<br/>But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,<br/>To be called up for her examination.<br/><br/>Of course these groups were scattered here and there,<br/>  Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.<br/>The lawyers in the study; and in air<br/>  The prize pig, ploughman, poachers: the men sent<br/>From town, viz. architect and dealer, were<br/>  Both busy (as a General in his tent<br/>Writing despatches) in their several stations,<br/>Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.<br/><br/>But this poor girl was left in the great hall,<br/>  While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,<br/>Discussed (he hated beer yclept the "small")<br/>  A mighty mug of _moral_ double ale.<br/>She waited until Justice could recall<br/>  Its kind attentions to their proper pale,<br/>To name a thing in nomenclature rather<br/>Perplexing for most virgins--a child's father.<br/><br/>You see here was enough of occupation<br/>  For the Lord Henry, linked with dogs and horses.<br/>There was much bustle too, and preparation<br/>  Below stairs on the score of second courses;<br/>Because, as suits their rank and situation,<br/>  Those who in counties have great land resources<br/>Have "public days," when all men may carouse,<br/>Though not exactly what's called "open house."<br/><br/>But once a week or fortnight, _un_invited<br/>  (Thus we translate a _general invitation_)<br/>All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,<br/>  May drop in without cards, and take their station<br/>At the full board, and sit alike delighted<br/>  With fashionable wines and conversation;<br/>And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,<br/>Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.<br/><br/>Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,<br/>  Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit.<br/>But county contests cost him rather dearer,<br/>  Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit<br/>Had English influence, in the self-same sphere here;<br/>  His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,<br/>Was member for the "other interest" (meaning<br/>The same self-interest, with a different leaning).<br/><br/>Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,<br/>  He was all things to all men, and dispensed<br/>To some civility, to others bounty,<br/>  And promises to all--which last commenced<br/>To gather to a somewhat large amount, he<br/>  Not calculating how much they condensed;<br/>But what with keeping some, and breaking others,<br/>His word had the same value as another's.<br/><br/>A friend to Freedom and freeholders--yet<br/>  No less a friend to Government--he held,<br/>That he exactly the just medium hit<br/>  Twixt Place and Patriotism--albeit compelled,<br/>Such was his Sovereign's pleasure, (though unfit,<br/>  He added modestly, when rebels railed,)<br/>To hold some sinecures he wished abolished,<br/>But that with them all Law would be demolished.<br/><br/>He was "free to confess"--(whence comes this phrase?<br/>  Is 't English? No--'tis only parliamentary)<br/>That Innovation's spirit now-a-days<br/>  Had made more progress than for the last century.<br/>He would not tread a factious path to praise,<br/>  Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;<br/>As for his place, he could but say this of it,<br/>That the fatigue was greater than the profit.<br/><br/>Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life<br/>  Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;<br/>But could he quit his King in times of strife,<br/>  Which threatened the whole country with perdition?<br/>When demagogues would with a butcher's knife<br/>  Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)<br/>The Gordian or the G_e_ordi-an knot, whose strings<br/>Have tied together Commons, Lords, and Kings.<br/><br/>Sooner "come Place into the Civil List<br/>  And champion him to the utmost--" he would keep it,<br/>Till duly disappointed or dismissed:<br/>  Profit he cared not for, let others reap it;<br/>But should the day come when Place ceased to exist,<br/>  The country would have far more cause to weep it:<br/>For how could it go on? Explain who can!<br/>_He_ gloried in the name of Englishman.<br/><br/>He was as independent--aye, much more--<br/>  Than those who were not paid for independence,<br/>As common soldiers, or a common----shore,<br/>  Have in their several arts or parts ascendance<br/>O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,<br/>  Who do not give professional attendance.<br/>Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager<br/>To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.<br/><br/>All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,<br/>  And thought. I say no more--I've said too much;<br/>For all of us have either heard or read--<br/>  Off--or _upon_ the hustings--some slight such<br/>Hints from the independent heart or head<br/>  Of the official candidate. I'll touch<br/>No more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,<br/>And grace is said; the grace I _should_ have _sung_--<br/><br/>But I'm too late, and therefore must make play.<br/>  'Twas a great banquet, such as Albion old<br/>Was wont to boast--as if a glutton's tray<br/>  Were something very glorious to behold.<br/>But 'twas a public feast and public day,--<br/>  Quite full--right dull--guests hot, and dishes cold,--<br/>Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,--<br/>And everybody out of their own sphere.<br/><br/>The squires familiarly formal, and<br/>  My Lords and Ladies proudly condescending;<br/>The very servants puzzling how to hand<br/>  Their plates--without it might be too much bending<br/>From their high places by the sideboard's stand--<br/>  Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending;<br/>For any deviation from the graces<br/>Might cost both man and master too--their _places_.<br/><br/>There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,<br/>  Whose hounds ne'er erred, nor greyhounds deigned to lurch;<br/>Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen<br/>  Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search<br/>Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.<br/>  There were some massy members of the church,<br/>Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,<br/>And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.<br/><br/>There were some country wags too--and, alas!<br/>  Some exiles from the Town, who had been driven<br/>To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,<br/>  And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.<br/>And lo! upon that day it came to pass,<br/>  I sate next that o'erwhelming son of Heaven,<br/>The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,<br/>The loudest wit I e'er was deafened with.<br/><br/>I knew him in his livelier London days,<br/>  A brilliant diner-out, though but a curate,<br/>And not a joke he cut but earned its praise,<br/>  Until Preferment, coming at a sure rate,<br/>(O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!<br/>  Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?)<br/>Gave him, to lay the Devil who looks o'er Lincoln,<br/>A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.<br/><br/>His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;<br/>  But both were thrown away amongst the fens;<br/>For Wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.<br/>  No longer ready ears and short-hand pens<br/>Imbibed the gay _bon-mot_, or happy hoax:<br/>  The poor priest was reduced to common sense,<br/>Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,<br/>To hammer a hoarse laugh from the thick throng.<br/><br/>There _is_ a difference, says the song, "between<br/>  A beggar and a Queen," or _was_ (of late<br/>The latter worse used of the two we've seen--<br/>  But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);<br/>A difference "'twixt a Bishop and a Dean,"<br/>  A difference between crockery ware and plate,<br/>As between English beef and Spartan broth--<br/>And yet great heroes have been bred by both.<br/><br/>But of all Nature's discrepancies, none<br/>  Upon the whole is greater than the difference<br/>Beheld between the Country and the Town,<br/>  Of which the latter merits every preference<br/>From those who have few resources of their own.<br/>  And only think, or act, or feel, with reference<br/>To some small plan of interest or ambition--<br/>Both which are limited to no condition.<br/><br/>But _En avant!_ The light loves languish o'er<br/>  Long banquets and too many guests, although<br/>A slight repast makes people love much more,<br/>  Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know,<br/>Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore<br/>  With vivifying Venus, who doth owe<br/>To these the invention of champagne and truffles:<br/>Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.<br/><br/>Dully passed o'er the dinner of the day;<br/>  And Juan took his place, he knew not where,<br/>Confused, in the confusion, and _distrait_,<br/>  And sitting as if nailed upon his chair:<br/>Though knives and forks clanked round as in a fray,<br/>  He seemed unconscious of all passing there,<br/>Till some one, with a groan, expressed a wish<br/>(Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.<br/><br/>On which, at the _third_ asking of the banns,<br/>  He started; and perceiving smiles around<br/>Broadening to grins, he coloured more than once,<br/>  And hastily--as nothing can confound<br/>A wise man more than laughter from a dunce--<br/>  Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,<br/>And with such hurry, that, ere he could curb it,<br/>He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.<br/><br/>This was no bad mistake, as it occurred,<br/>  The supplicator being an amateur;<br/>But others, who were left with scarce a third,<br/>  Were angry--as they well might, to be sure,<br/>They wondered how a young man so absurd<br/>  Lord Henry at his table should endure;<br/>And this, and his not knowing how much oats<br/>Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.<br/><br/>They little knew, or might have sympathized,<br/>  That he the night before had seen a ghost,<br/>A prologue which but slightly harmonized<br/>  With the substantial company engrossed<br/>By matter, and so much materialised,<br/>  That one scarce knew at what to marvel most<br/>Of two things--_how_ (the question rather odd is)<br/>Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies!<br/><br/>But what confused him more than smile or stare<br/>  From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,<br/>Who wondered at the abstraction of his air,<br/>  Especially as he had been renowned<br/>For some vivacity among the fair,<br/>  Even in the country circle's narrow bound--<br/>(For little things upon my Lord's estate<br/>Were good small talk for others still less great)--<br/><br/>Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,<br/>  And something like a smile upon her cheek.<br/>Now this he really rather took amiss;<br/>  In those who rarely smile, their smile bespeaks<br/>A strong external motive; and in this<br/>  Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique,<br/>Or Hope, or Love--with any of the wiles<br/>Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.<br/><br/>'Twas a mere quiet smile of contemplation,<br/>  Indicative of some surprise and pity;<br/>And Juan grew carnation with vexation,<br/>  Which was not very wise, and still less witty,<br/>Since he had gained at least her observation,<br/>  A most important outwork of the city--<br/>As Juan should have known, had not his senses<br/>By last night's Ghost been driven from their defences.<br/><br/>But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,<br/>  Nor seem embarrassed--quite the contrary;<br/>Her aspect was as usual, still--_not_ stern--<br/>  And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,<br/>Yet grew a little pale--with what? concern?<br/>  I know not; but her colour ne'er was high--<br/>Though sometimes faintly flushed--and always clear,<br/>As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.<br/><br/>But Adeline was occupied by fame<br/>  This day; and watching, witching, condescending<br/>To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,<br/>  And dignity with courtesy so blending,<br/>As all must blend whose part it is to aim<br/>  (Especially as the sixth year is ending)<br/>At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's<br/>Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.<br/><br/>Though this was most expedient on the whole<br/>  And usual--Juan, when he cast a glance<br/>On Adeline while playing her grand _r√¥le_,<br/>  Which she went through as though it were a dance,<br/>Betraying only now and then her soul<br/>  By a look scarce perceptibly askance<br/>(Of weariness or scorn), began to feel<br/>Some doubt how much of Adeline was _real_;<br/><br/>So well she acted all and every part<br/>  By turns--with that vivacious versatility,<br/>Which many people take for want of heart.<br/>  They err--'tis merely what is called mobility,<br/>A thing of temperament and not of art,<br/>  Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;<br/>And false--though true; for, surely, they're sincerest<br/>Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.<br/><br/>This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,<br/>  Heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never:<br/>But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,<br/>  Little that's great, but much of what is clever;<br/>Most orators, but very few financiers,<br/>  Though all Exchequer Chancellors endeavour,<br/>Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,<br/>And grow quite figurative with their figures.<br/><br/>The poets of Arithmetic are they<br/>  Who, though they prove not two and two to be<br/>Five, as they might do in a modest way,<br/>  Have plainly made it out that four are three,<br/>Judging by what they take, and what they pay:<br/>  The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,<br/>That most unliquidating liquid, leaves<br/>The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.<br/><br/>While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,<br/>  The fair Fitz-Fulke seemed very much at ease;<br/>Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,<br/>  Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize<br/>The ridicules of people in all places--<br/>  That honey of your fashionable bees--<br/>And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;<br/>And this at present was her kind employment.<br/><br/>However, the day closed, as days must close;<br/>  The evening also waned--and coffee came.<br/>Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,<br/>  And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,<br/>Retired: with most unfashionable bows<br/>  Their docile Esquires also did the same,<br/>Delighted with their dinner and their Host,<br/>But with the Lady Adeline the most.<br/><br/>Some praised her beauty: others her great grace;<br/>  The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity<br/>Was obvious in each feature of her face,<br/>  Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.<br/>Yes; _she_ was truly worthy _her_ high place!<br/>  No one could envy her deserved prosperity.<br/>And then her dress--what beautiful simplicity<br/>Draperied her form with curious felicity!<br/><br/>Meanwhile sweet Adeline deserved their praises,<br/>  By an impartial indemnification<br/>For all her past exertion and soft phrases,<br/>  In a most edifying conversation,<br/>Which turned upon their late guests' miens and faces,<br/>  Their families, even to the last relation;<br/>Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,<br/>And truculent distortion of their tresses.<br/><br/>True, _she_ said little--'twas the rest that broke<br/>  Forth into universal epigram;<br/>But then 'twas to the purpose what she spoke:<br/>  Like Addison's "faint praise," so wont to damn,<br/>Her own but served to set off every joke,<br/>  As music chimes in with a melodrame.<br/>How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!<br/>I ask but this of mine, to----_not_ defend.<br/><br/>There were but two exceptions to this keen<br/>  Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one,<br/>Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;<br/>  And Juan, too, in general behind none<br/>In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,<br/>  Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:<br/>In vain he heard the others rail or rally,<br/>He would not join them in a single sally.<br/><br/>'Tis true he saw Aurora look as though<br/>  She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook<br/>Its motive for that charity we owe<br/>  But seldom pay the absent, nor would look<br/>Farther--it might or it might not be so.<br/>  But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,<br/>Observing little in his reverie,<br/>Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.<br/><br/>The Ghost at least had done him this much good,<br/>  In making him as silent as a ghost,<br/>If in the circumstances which ensued<br/>  He gained esteem where it was worth the most;<br/>And, certainly, Aurora had renewed<br/>  In him some feelings he had lately lost,<br/>Or hardened; feelings which, perhaps ideal,<br/>Are so divine, that I must deem them real:--<br/><br/>The love of higher things and better days;<br/>  The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance<br/>Of what is called the World, and the World's ways;<br/>  The moments when we gather from a glance<br/>More joy than from all future pride or praise,<br/>  Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance<br/>The Heart in an existence of its own,<br/>Of which another's bosom is the zone.<br/><br/>Who would not sigh Œë·º¥ Œ±·º¥ œÑ·Ω∞ŒΩ ŒöœÖŒ∏·Ω≥œÅŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ<br/>  That _hath_ a memory, or that _had_ a heart?<br/>Alas! _her_ star must fade like that of Dian:<br/>  Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.<br/>Anacreon only had the soul to tie an<br/>  Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart<br/>Of Eros: but though thou hast played us many tricks,<br/>Still we respect thee,"_Alma Venus Genetrix!_"<br/><br/>And full of sentiments, sublime as billows<br/>  Heaving between this World and Worlds beyond,<br/>Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows<br/>  Arrived, retired to his; but to despond<br/>Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows<br/>  Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond<br/>Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,<br/>And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.<br/><br/>The night was as before: he was undrest,<br/>  Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;<br/>Completely _sans culotte_, and without vest;<br/>  In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:<br/>But apprehensive of his spectral guest,<br/>  He sate with feelings awkward to express<br/>(By those who have not had such visitations),<br/>Expectant of the Ghost's fresh operations.<br/><br/>And not in vain he listened;--Hush! what's that?<br/>  I see--I see--Ah, no!--'t is not--yet 't is--<br/>Ye powers! it is the--the--the--Pooh! the cat!<br/>  The Devil may take that stealthy pace of his!<br/>So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,<br/>  Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,<br/>Gliding the first time to a _rendezvous_,<br/>And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.<br/><br/>Again--what is 't? The wind? No, no,--this time<br/>  It is the sable Friar as before,<br/>With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,<br/>  Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.<br/>Again through shadows of the night sublime,<br/>  When deep sleep fell on men, and the World wore<br/>The starry darkness round her like a girdle<br/>Spangled with gems--the Monk made his blood curdle.<br/><br/>A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,<br/>  Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,<br/>Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,<br/>  Sounding like very supernatural water,<br/>Came over Juan's ear, which throbbed, alas!<br/>  For Immaterialism's a serious matter;<br/>So that even those whose faith is the most great<br/>In Souls immortal, shun them _t√™te-√†-t√™te_.<br/><br/>Were his eyes open?--Yes! and his mouth too.<br/>  Surprise has this effect--to make one dumb,<br/>Yet leave the gate which Eloquence slips through<br/>  As wide as if a long speech were to come.<br/>Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,<br/>  Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:<br/>His eyes were open, and (as was before<br/>Stated) his mouth. What opened next?--the door.<br/><br/>It opened with a most infernal creak,<br/>  Like that of Hell. "Lasciate ogni speranza,<br/>Voi, ch' entrate!" The hinge seemed to speak,<br/>  Dreadful as Dante's _rima_, or this stanza;<br/>Or--but all words upon such themes are weak:<br/>  A single shade's sufficient to entrance a<br/>Hero--for what is Substance to a Spirit?<br/>Or how is 't _Matter_ trembles to come near it?<br/><br/>The door flew wide, not swiftly,--but, as fly<br/>  The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight--<br/>And then swung back; nor close--but stood awry,<br/>  Half letting in long shadows on the light,<br/>Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,<br/>  For he had two, both tolerably bright,<br/>And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood<br/>The sable Friar in his solemn hood.<br/><br/>Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken<br/>  The night before; but being sick of shaking,<br/>He first inclined to think he had been mistaken;<br/>  And then to be ashamed of such mistaking;<br/>His own internal ghost began to awaken<br/>  Within him, and to quell his corporal quaking--<br/>Hinting that Soul and Body on the whole<br/>Were odds against a disembodied Soul.<br/><br/>And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,<br/>  And he arose, advanced--the Shade retreated;<br/>But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,<br/>  Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,<br/>Resolved to thrust the mystery _carte_ and _tierce_,<br/>  At whatsoever risk of being defeated:<br/>The Ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until<br/>He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.<br/><br/>Juan put forth one arm--Eternal powers!<br/>  It touched no soul, nor body, but the wall,<br/>On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers,<br/>  Chequered with all the tracery of the Hall;<br/>He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers<br/>  When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.<br/>How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity<br/>Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity!<br/><br/>But still the Shade remained: the blue eyes glared,<br/>  And rather variably for stony death;<br/>Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared,<br/>  The Ghost had a remarkably sweet breath:<br/>A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired;<br/>  A red lip, with two rows of pearls beneath,<br/>Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud<br/>The Moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.<br/><br/>And Juan, puzzled, but still curious, thrust<br/>  His other arm forth--Wonder upon wonder!<br/>It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,<br/>  Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.<br/>He found, as people on most trials must,<br/>  That he had made at first a silly blunder,<br/>And that in his confusion he had caught<br/>Only the wall, instead of what he sought.<br/><br/>The Ghost, if Ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul<br/>  As ever lurked beneath a holy hood:<br/>A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory, stole<br/>  Forth into something much like flesh and blood;<br/>Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl,<br/>  And they revealed--alas! that e'er they should!<br/>In full, voluptuous, but _not o'er_grown bulk,<br/>The phantom of her frolic Grace--Fitz-Fulke!<br/><br/>CANTO THE SEVENTEENTH.<br/><br/>The world is full of orphans: firstly, those<br/>  Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase;<br/>But many a lonely tree the loftier grows<br/>  Than others crowded in the Forest's maze--<br/>The next are such as are not doomed to lose<br/>  Their tender parents, in their budding days,<br/>But, merely, their parental tenderness,<br/>Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.<br/><br/>The next are "_only_ Children," as they are styled,<br/>  Who grow up _Children_ only, since th' old saw<br/>Pronounces that an "only's" a spoilt child--<br/>  But not to go too far, I hold it law,<br/>That where their education, harsh or mild,<br/>  Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,<br/>The sufferers--be 't in heart or intellect--<br/>Whate'er the _cause_, are orphans in _effect_.<br/><br/>But to return unto the stricter rule--<br/>  As far as words make rules--our common notion<br/>Of orphan paints at once a parish school,<br/>  A half-starved babe, a wreck upon Life's ocean,<br/>A human (what the Italians nickname) "Mule!"<br/>  A theme for Pity or some worse emotion;<br/>Yet, if examined, it might be admitted<br/>The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.<br/><br/>Too soon they are Parents to themselves: for what<br/>  Are Tutors, Guardians, and so forth, compared<br/>With Nature's genial Genitors? so that<br/>  A child of Chancery, that Star-Chamber ward,<br/>(I'll take the likeness I can first come at,)<br/>  Is like--a duckling by Dame Partlett reared,<br/>And frights--especially if 'tis a daughter,<br/>Th' old Hen--by running headlong to the water.<br/><br/>There is a common-place book argument,<br/>  Which glibly glides from every tongue;<br/>When any dare a new light to present,<br/>  "If you are right, then everybody's wrong"!<br/>Suppose the converse of this precedent<br/>  So often urged, so loudly and so long;<br/>"If you are wrong, then everybody's right"!<br/>Was ever everybody yet so quite?<br/><br/>Therefore I would solicit free discussion<br/>  Upon all points--no matter what, or whose--<br/>Because as Ages upon Ages push on,<br/>  The last is apt the former to accuse<br/>Of pillowing its head on a pin-cushion,<br/>  Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse:<br/>What was a paradox becomes a truth or<br/>A something like it--witness Luther!<br/><br/>The Sacraments have been reduced to two,<br/>  And Witches unto none, though somewhat late<br/>Since burning ag√©d women (save a few--<br/>  Not witches only b--ches--who create<br/>Mischief in families, as some know or knew,<br/>  Should still be singed, but lightly, let me state,)<br/>Has been declared an act of inurbanity,<br/>_Malgr√©_ Sir Matthew Hales's great humanity.<br/><br/>Great Galileo was debarred the Sun,<br/>  Because he fixed it; and, to stop his talking,<br/>How Earth could round the solar orbit run,<br/>  Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking:<br/>The man was well-nigh dead, ere men begun<br/>  To think his skull had not some need of caulking;<br/>But now, it seems, he's right--his notion just:<br/>No doubt a consolation to his dust.<br/><br/>Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates--but pages<br/>  Might be filled up, as vainly as before,<br/>With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,<br/>  Who in his life-time, each, was deemed a Bore!<br/>The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages:<br/>  This they must bear with and, perhaps, much more;<br/>The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he<br/>Will have a firm Post Obit on posterity.<br/><br/>If such doom waits each intellectual Giant,<br/>  We little people in our lesser way,<br/>In Life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,<br/>  And so for one will I--as well I may--Would<br/>that I were less bilious--but, oh, fie on 't!<br/>    Just as I make my mind up every day,<br/>To be a "_totus, teres_," Stoic, Sage,<br/>The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.<br/><br/>Temperate I am--yet never had a temper;<br/>  Modest I am--yet with some slight assurance;<br/>Changeable too--yet somehow "_Idem semper_:"<br/>  Patient--but not enamoured of endurance;<br/>Cheerful--but, sometimes, rather apt to whimper:<br/>  Mild--but at times a sort of "_Hercules furens_:"<br/>So that I almost think that the same skin<br/>For one without--has two or three within.<br/><br/>Our Hero was, in Canto the Sixteenth,<br/>  Left in a tender moonlight situation,<br/>Such as enables Man to show his strength<br/>  Moral or physical: on this occasion<br/>Whether his virtue triumphed--or, at length,<br/>  His vice--for he was of a kindling nation--<br/>Is more than I shall venture to describe;--<br/>Unless some Beauty with a kiss should bribe.<br/><br/>I leave the thing a problem, like all things:--<br/>  The morning came--and breakfast, tea and toast,<br/>Of which most men partake, but no one sings.<br/>  The company whose birth, wealth, worth, has cost<br/>My trembling Lyre already several strings,<br/>  Assembled with our hostess, and mine host;<br/>The guests dropped in--the last but one, Her Grace,<br/>The latest, Juan, with his virgin face.<br/><br/>Which best it is to encounter--Ghost, or none,<br/>  'Twere difficult to say--but Juan looked<br/>As if he had combated with more than one,<br/>  Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked<br/>The light, that through the Gothic window shone:<br/>  Her Grace, too, had a sort of air rebuked--<br/>Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept<br/>A vigil, or dreamt rather more than slept.
