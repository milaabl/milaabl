# üíÆ Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    What beckoning ghost, along the moonlight shade<br/>Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?<br/>'Tis she!--but why that bleeding bosom gored,<br/>Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?<br/>Oh, ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,<br/>Is it, in heaven, a crime to love too well?<br/>To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,<br/>To act a lover's or a Roman's part?<br/>Is there no bright reversion in the sky,<br/>For those who greatly think, or bravely die?<br/><br/>Why bade ye else, ye Powers! her soul aspire<br/>Above the vulgar flight of low desire?<br/>Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;<br/>The glorious fault of angels and of gods:<br/>Thence to their images on earth it flows,<br/>And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.<br/>Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,<br/>Dull, sullen prisoners in the body's cage:<br/>Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years<br/>Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;<br/>Like Eastern kings a lazy state they keep,<br/>And, close confined to their own palace, sleep.<br/><br/>From these perhaps (ere Nature bade her die)<br/>Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.<br/>As into air the purer spirits flow,<br/>And separate from their kindred dregs below;<br/>So flew the soul to its congenial place,<br/>Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.<br/><br/>But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,<br/>Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!<br/>See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,<br/>These cheeks, now fading at the blast of death;<br/>Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,<br/>And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.<br/>Thus, if Eternal Justice rules the ball,<br/>Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall:<br/>On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,<br/>And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.<br/>There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,<br/>(While the long funerals blacken all the way)<br/>'Lo, these were they, whose souls the Furies steel'd,<br/>And cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield.'<br/>Thus unlamented pass the proud away,<br/>The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!<br/>So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow<br/>For others' good, or melt at others' woe.<br/><br/>What can atone (O ever-injured Shade!)<br/>Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?<br/>No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear<br/>Pleased thy pale ghost, or graced thy mournful bier,<br/>By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,<br/>By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed,<br/>By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,<br/>By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!<br/>What, though no friends in sable weeds appear,<br/>Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,<br/>And bear about the mockery of woe<br/>To midnight dances, and the public show?<br/>What, though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,<br/>Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?<br/>What, though no sacred earth allow thee room,<br/>Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?<br/>Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dress'd,<br/>And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:<br/>There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,<br/>There the first roses of the year shall blow;<br/>While angels with their silver wings o'ershade<br/>The ground, now sacred by thy relics made.<br/><br/>So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,<br/>What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.<br/>How loved, how honour'd once, avails thee not,<br/>To whom related, or by whom begot;<br/>A heap of dust alone remains of thee,<br/>'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!<br/><br/>Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,<br/>Deaf the praised ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.<br/>Even he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,<br/>Shall shortly want the generous tear he pays;<br/>Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,<br/>And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart;<br/>Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,<br/>The Muse forgot, and thou beloved no more!
