# üíÆ Man and Dog by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    "'TWILL take some getting." "Sir, I think 'twill<br/>    so."<br/>The old man stared up at the mistletoe<br/>That hung too high in the poplar's crest for plunder<br/>Of any climber, though not for kissing under:<br/>Then he went on against the north-east wind--<br/>Straight but lame, leaning on a staff new-skinned,<br/>Carrying a brolly, flag-basket, and old coat,--<br/>Towards Alton, ten miles off. And he had not<br/>Done less from Chilgrove where he pulled up docks.<br/>'Twere best, if he had had "a money-box,"<br/>To have waited there till the sheep cleared a field<br/>For what a half-week's flint-picking would yield.<br/>His mind was running on the work he had done<br/>Since he left Christchurch in the New Forest, one<br/>Spring in the 'seventies,--navvying on dock and<br/>    line<br/>From Southampton to Newcastle-on-Tyne,--<br/>In 'seventy-four a year of soldiering<br/>With the Berkshires,--hoeing and harvesting<br/>In half the shires where corn and couch will grow.<br/>His sons, three sons, were fighting, but the hoe<br/>And reap-hook he liked, or anything to do with<br/>    trees.<br/>He fell once from a poplar tall as these:<br/>The Flying Man they called him in hospital.<br/>"If I flew now, to another world I'd fall."<br/>He laughed and whistled to the small brown bitch<br/>With spots of blue that hunted in the ditch.<br/>Her foxy Welsh grandfather must have paired<br/>Beneath him. He kept sheep in Wales and scared<br/>Strangers, I will warrant, with his pearl eye<br/>And trick of shrinking off as he were shy,<br/>Then following close in silence for--for what?<br/>"No rabbit, never fear, she ever got,<br/>Yet always hunts. To-day she nearly had one:<br/>She would and she wouldn't. 'Twas like that. The<br/>    bad one!<br/>She's not much use, but still she's company,<br/>Though I'm not. She goes everywhere with me.<br/>So Alton I must reach to-night somehow:<br/>I'll get no shakedown with that bedfellow<br/>From farmers. Many a man sleeps worse to-night<br/>Than I shall." "In the trenches." "Yes, that's<br/>    right.<br/>But they'll be out of that--I hope they be--<br/>This weather, marching after the enemy."<br/>"And so I hope. Good luck." And there I nodded<br/>"Good-night. You keep straight on." Stiffly he<br/>    plodded;<br/>And at his heels the crisp leaves scurried fast,<br/>And the leaf-coloured robin watched. They<br/>    passed,<br/>The robin till next day, the man for good,<br/>Together in the twilight of the wood.
