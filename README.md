# üíÆ Satire II. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    'Quid vetat et nosmet Lucil√Æ scripta legentes Quaerere, num illius, num<br/>rerum dura neg√¢rit Versiculos natura magis factos, et euntes Mollius?'<br/><br/>HOR.<br/><br/>THE SATIRES OF DR JOHN DONNE, DEAN OF ST PAUL'S, VERSIFIED.<br/><br/>SATIRES AND EPISTLES OF HORACE IMITATED.<br/><br/>Yes; thank my stars! as early as I knew<br/>This town, I had the sense to hate it too:<br/>Yet here, as ev'n in Hell, there must be still<br/>One giant-vice, so excellently ill,<br/>That all beside, one pities, not abhors;<br/>As who knows Sappho, smiles at other whores.<br/><br/>I grant that poetry's a crying sin;<br/>It brought (no doubt) the Excise and Army in:<br/>Catch'd like the plague, or love, the Lord knows how,<br/>But that the cure is starving, all allow.<br/>Yet like the papist's is the poet's state,<br/>Poor and disarm'd, and hardly worth your hate!<br/><br/>Here a lean bard, whose wit could never give<br/>Himself a dinner, makes an actor live;<br/>The thief condemn'd, in law already dead,<br/>So prompts, and saves a rogue who cannot read.<br/>Thus as the pipes of some carved organ move,<br/>The gilded puppets dance and mount above.<br/>Heaved by the breath the inspiring bellows blow:<br/>The inspiring bellows lie and pant below.<br/><br/>One sings the fair; but songs no longer move;<br/>No rat is rhymed to death, nor maid to love:<br/>In love's, in nature's spite, the siege they hold,<br/>And scorn the flesh, the devil, and all--but gold.<br/>These write to lords, some mean reward to get,<br/>As needy beggars sing at doors for meat.<br/>Those write because all write, and so have still<br/>Excuse for writing, and for writing ill.<br/><br/>Wretched indeed! but far more wretched yet<br/>Is he who makes his meal on others' wit:<br/>'Tis changed, no doubt, from what it was before,<br/>His rank digestion makes it wit no more:<br/>Sense, pass'd through him, no longer is the same;<br/>For food digested takes another name.<br/><br/>I pass o'er all those confessors and martyrs,<br/>Who live like Sutton, or who die like Chartres,<br/>Out-cant old Esdras, or out-drink his heir,<br/>Out-usure Jews, or Irishmen out-swear;<br/>Wicked as pages, who in early years<br/>Act sins which Prisca's confessor scarce hears.<br/>Ev'n those I pardon, for whose sinful sake<br/>Schoolmen new tenements in hell must make;<br/>Of whose strange crimes no canonist can tell<br/>In what commandment's large contents they dwell.<br/><br/>One, one man only breeds my just offence;<br/>Whom crimes gave wealth, and wealth gave impudence:<br/>Time, that at last matures a clap to pox,<br/>Whose gentle progress makes a calf an ox,<br/>And brings all natural events to pass,<br/>Hath made him an attorney of an ass.<br/>No young divine, new-beneficed, can be<br/>More pert, more proud, more positive than he.<br/>What further could I wish the fop to do,<br/>But turn a wit, and scribble verses too;<br/>Pierce the soft labyrinth of a lady's ear<br/>With rhymes of this per cent, and that per year?<br/>Or court a wife, spread out his wily parts,<br/>Like nets or lime-twigs, for rich widows' hearts:<br/>Call himself barrister to every wench,<br/>And woo in language of the Pleas and Bench?<br/>Language, which Boreas might to Auster hold<br/>More rough than forty Germans when they scold.<br/><br/>Cursed be the wretch, so venal and so vain:<br/>Paltry and proud, as drabs in Drury-lane.<br/>'Tis such a bounty as was never known,<br/>If Peter deigns to help you to your own:<br/>What thanks, what praise, if Peter but supplies,<br/>And what a solemn face, if he denies!<br/>Grave, as when prisoners shake the head and swear<br/>'Twas only suretiship that brought 'em there.<br/>His office keeps your parchment fates entire,<br/>He starves with cold to save them from the fire;<br/>For you he walks the streets through rain or dust,<br/>For not in chariots Peter puts his trust;<br/>For you he sweats and labours at the laws,<br/>Takes God to witness he affects your cause,<br/>And lies to every lord in every thing,<br/>Like a king's favourite, or like a king.<br/>These are the talents that adorn them all,<br/>From wicked Waters ev'n to godly Paul.<br/>Not more of simony beneath black gowns,<br/>Not more of bastardy in heirs to crowns.<br/>In shillings and in pence at first they deal;<br/>And steal so little, few perceive they steal;<br/>Till, like the sea, they compass all the land,<br/>From Scots to Wight, from Mount to Dover strand:<br/>And when rank widows purchase luscious nights,<br/>Or when a duke to Jansen punts at White's,<br/>Or city-heir in mortgage melts away;<br/>Satan himself feels far less joy than they.<br/>Piecemeal they win this acre first, then that,<br/>Glean on, and gather up the whole estate.<br/>Then strongly fencing ill-got wealth by law,<br/>Indentures, covenants, articles they draw,<br/>Large as the fields themselves, and larger far<br/>Than civil codes, with all their glosses, are;<br/>So vast, our new divines, we must confess,<br/>Are fathers of the Church for writing less.<br/>But let them write for you, each rogue impairs<br/>The deeds, and dext'rously omits, _ses heires_:<br/>No commentator can more slily pass<br/>O'er a learn'd, unintelligible place;<br/>Or, in quotation, shrewd divines leave out<br/>Those words, that would against them clear the doubt.<br/><br/>So Luther thought the Pater-noster long,<br/>When doom'd to say his beads and even-song;<br/>But having cast his cowl, and left those laws,<br/>Adds to Christ's prayer, the Power and Glory clause.<br/><br/>The lands are bought; but where are to be found<br/>Those ancient woods, that shaded all the ground?<br/>We see no new-built palaces aspire,<br/>No kitchens emulate the vestal fire.<br/>Where are those troops of poor, that throng'd of yore<br/>The good old landlord's hospitable door?<br/>Well, I could wish, that still in lordly domes<br/>Some beasts were kill'd, though not whole hecatombs;<br/>That both extremes were banish'd from their walls,<br/>Carthusian fasts, and fulsome Bacchanals;<br/>And all mankind might that just mean observe,<br/>In which none e'er could surfeit, none could starve.<br/>These as good works, 'tis true, we all allow;<br/>But oh! these works are not in fashion now:<br/>Like rich old wardrobes, things extremely rare,<br/>Extremely fine, but what no man will wear.<br/><br/>Thus much I've said, I trust, without offence;<br/>Let no court sycophant pervert my sense,<br/>Nor sly informer watch these words to draw<br/>Within the reach of treason, or the law.
