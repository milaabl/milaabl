# üíÆ The Princess (part 5) by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Now, scarce three paces measured from the mound,<br/>We stumbled on a stationary voice,<br/>And 'Stand, who goes?' 'Two from the palace' I.<br/>'The second two: they wait,' he said, 'pass on;<br/>His Highness wakes:' and one, that clashed in arms,<br/>By glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led<br/>Threading the soldier-city, till we heard<br/>The drowsy folds of our great ensign shake<br/>From blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent<br/>Whispers of war.<br/>Entering, the sudden light<br/>Dazed me half-blind: I stood and seemed to hear,<br/>As in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes<br/>A lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,<br/>Each hissing in his neighbour's ear; and then<br/>A strangled titter, out of which there brake<br/>On all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,<br/>Unmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings<br/>Began to wag their baldness up and down,<br/>The fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,<br/>The huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,<br/>And slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.<br/><br/>At length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,<br/>Panted from weary sides 'King, you are free!<br/>We did but keep you surety for our son,<br/>If this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,<br/>That tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:'<br/>For I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,<br/>More crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,<br/>And all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.<br/>Then some one sent beneath his vaulted palm<br/>A whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look,<br/>He has been among his shadows.' 'Satan take<br/>The old women and their shadows! (thus the King<br/>Roared) make yourself a man to fight with men.<br/>Go: Cyril told us all.'<br/>As boys that slink<br/>From ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,<br/>Away we stole, and transient in a trice<br/>From what was left of faded woman-slough<br/>To sheathing splendours and the golden scale<br/>Of harness, issued in the sun, that now<br/>Leapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,<br/>And hit the Northern hills. Here Cyril met us.<br/>A little shy at first, but by and by<br/>We twain, with mutual pardon asked and given<br/>For stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon<br/>Followed his tale. Amazed he fled away<br/>Through the dark land, and later in the night<br/>Had come on Psyche weeping: 'then we fell<br/>Into your father's hand, and there she lies,<br/>But will not speak, or stir.'<br/>He showed a tent<br/>A stone-shot off: we entered in, and there<br/>Among piled arms and rough accoutrements,<br/>Pitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak,<br/>Like some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,<br/>And pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,<br/>All her fair length upon the ground she lay:<br/>And at her head a follower of the camp,<br/>A charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,<br/>Sat watching like the watcher by the dead.<br/><br/>Then Florian knelt, and 'Come' he whispered to her,<br/>'Lift up your head, sweet sister: lie not thus.<br/>What have you done but right? you could not slay<br/>Me, nor your prince: look up: be comforted:<br/>Sweet is it to have done the thing one ought,<br/>When fallen in darker ways.' And likewise I:<br/>'Be comforted: have I not lost her too,<br/>In whose least act abides the nameless charm<br/>That none has else for me?' She heard, she moved,<br/>She moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,<br/>And raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth<br/>As those that mourn half-shrouded over death<br/>In deathless marble. 'Her,' she said, 'my friend--<br/>Parted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--<br/>Where shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?<br/>O base and bad! what comfort? none for me!'<br/>To whom remorseful Cyril, 'Yet I pray<br/>Take comfort: live, dear lady, for your child!'<br/>At which she lifted up her voice and cried.<br/><br/>'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,<br/>My one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!<br/>For now will cruel Ida keep her back;<br/>And either she will die from want of care,<br/>Or sicken with ill-usage, when they say<br/>The child is hers--for every little fault,<br/>The child is hers; and they will beat my girl<br/>Remembering her mother: O my flower!<br/>Or they will take her, they will make her hard,<br/>And she will pass me by in after-life<br/>With some cold reverence worse than were she dead.<br/>Ill mother that I was to leave her there,<br/>To lag behind, scared by the cry they made,<br/>The horror of the shame among them all:<br/>But I will go and sit beside the doors,<br/>And make a wild petition night and day,<br/>Until they hate to hear me like a wind<br/>Wailing for ever, till they open to me,<br/>And lay my little blossom at my feet,<br/>My babe, my sweet Agla√Øa, my one child:<br/>And I will take her up and go my way,<br/>And satisfy my soul with kissing her:<br/>Ah! what might that man not deserve of me<br/>Who gave me back my child?' 'Be comforted,'<br/>Said Cyril, 'you shall have it:' but again<br/>She veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so<br/>Like tender things that being caught feign death,<br/>Spoke not, nor stirred.<br/>By this a murmur ran<br/>Through all the camp and inward raced the scouts<br/>With rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.<br/>We left her by the woman, and without<br/>Found the gray kings at parle: and 'Look you' cried<br/>My father 'that our compact be fulfilled:<br/>You have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:<br/>She wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:<br/>But red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;<br/>She yields, or war.'<br/>Then Gama turned to me:<br/>'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time<br/>With our strange girl: and yet they say that still<br/>You love her. Give us, then, your mind at large:<br/>How say you, war or not?'<br/>'Not war, if possible,<br/>O king,' I said, 'lest from the abuse of war,<br/>The desecrated shrine, the trampled year,<br/>The smouldering homestead, and the household flower<br/>Torn from the lintel--all the common wrong--<br/>A smoke go up through which I loom to her<br/>Three times a monster: now she lightens scorn<br/>At him that mars her plan, but then would hate<br/>(And every voice she talked with ratify it,<br/>And every face she looked on justify it)<br/>The general foe. More soluble is this knot,<br/>By gentleness than war. I want her love.<br/>What were I nigher this although we dashed<br/>Your cities into shards with catapults,<br/>She would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,<br/>The lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,<br/>Not ever would she love; but brooding turn<br/>The book of scorn, till all my flitting chance<br/>Were caught within the record of her wrongs,<br/>And crushed to death: and rather, Sire, than this<br/>I would the old God of war himself were dead,<br/>Forgotten, rusting on his iron hills,<br/>Rotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,<br/>Or like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,<br/>Not to be molten out.'<br/>And roughly spake<br/>My father, 'Tut, you know them not, the girls.<br/>Boy, when I hear you prate I almost think<br/>That idiot legend credible. Look you, Sir!<br/>Man is the hunter; woman is his game:<br/>The sleek and shining creatures of the chase,<br/>We hunt them for the beauty of their skins;<br/>They love us for it, and we ride them down.<br/>Wheedling and siding with them! Out! for shame!<br/>Boy, there's no rose that's half so dear to them<br/>As he that does the thing they dare not do,<br/>Breathing and sounding beauteous battle, comes<br/>With the air of the trumpet round him, and leaps in<br/>Among the women, snares them by the score<br/>Flattered and flustered, wins, though dashed with death<br/>He reddens what he kisses: thus I won<br/>You mother, a good mother, a good wife,<br/>Worth winning; but this firebrand--gentleness<br/>To such as her! if Cyril spake her true,<br/>To catch a dragon in a cherry net,<br/>To trip a tigress with a gossamer<br/>Were wisdom to it.'<br/>'Yea but Sire,' I cried,<br/>'Wild natures need wise curbs. The soldier? No:<br/>What dares not Ida do that she should prize<br/>The soldier? I beheld her, when she rose<br/>The yesternight, and storming in extremes,<br/>Stood for her cause, and flung defiance down<br/>Gagelike to man, and had not shunned the death,<br/>No, not the soldier's: yet I hold her, king,<br/>True woman: you clash them all in one,<br/>That have as many differences as we.<br/>The violet varies from the lily as far<br/>As oak from elm: one loves the soldier, one<br/>The silken priest of peace, one this, one that,<br/>And some unworthily; their sinless faith,<br/>A maiden moon that sparkles on a sty,<br/>Glorifying clown and satyr; whence they need<br/>More breadth of culture: is not Ida right?<br/>They worth it? truer to the law within?<br/>Severer in the logic of a life?<br/>Twice as magnetic to sweet influences<br/>Of earth and heaven? and she of whom you speak,<br/>My mother, looks as whole as some serene<br/>Creation minted in the golden moods<br/>Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch,<br/>But pure as lines of green that streak the white<br/>Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves; I say,<br/>Not like the piebald miscellany, man,<br/>Bursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire,<br/>But whole and one: and take them all-in-all,<br/>Were we ourselves but half as good, as kind,<br/>As truthful, much that Ida claims as right<br/>Had ne'er been mooted, but as frankly theirs<br/>As dues of Nature. To our point: not war:<br/>Lest I lose all.'<br/>'Nay, nay, you spake but sense'<br/>Said Gama. 'We remember love ourself<br/>In our sweet youth; we did not rate him then<br/>This red-hot iron to be shaped with blows.<br/>You talk almost like Ida: ~she~ can talk;<br/>And there is something in it as you say:<br/>But you talk kindlier: we esteem you for it.--<br/>He seems a gracious and a gallant Prince,<br/>I would he had our daughter: for the rest,<br/>Our own detention, why, the causes weighed,<br/>Fatherly fears--you used us courteously--<br/>We would do much to gratify your Prince--<br/>We pardon it; and for your ingress here<br/>Upon the skirt and fringe of our fair land,<br/>you did but come as goblins in the night,<br/>Nor in the furrow broke the ploughman's head,<br/>Nor burnt the grange, nor bussed the milking-maid,<br/>Nor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream:<br/>But let your Prince (our royal word upon it,<br/>He comes back safe) ride with us to our lines,<br/>And speak with Arac: Arac's word is thrice<br/>As ours with Ida: something may be done--<br/>I know not what--and ours shall see us friends.<br/>You, likewise, our late guests, if so you will,<br/>Follow us: who knows? we four may build some plan<br/>Foursquare to opposition.'<br/>Here he reached<br/>White hands of farewell to my sire, who growled<br/>An answer which, half-muffled in his beard,<br/>Let so much out as gave us leave to go.<br/><br/>Then rode we with the old king across the lawns<br/>Beneath huge trees, a thousand rings of Spring<br/>In every bole, a song on every spray<br/>Of birds that piped their Valentines, and woke<br/>Desire in me to infuse my tale of love<br/>In the old king's ears, who promised help, and oozed<br/>All o'er with honeyed answer as we rode<br/>And blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews<br/>Gathered by night and peace, with each light air<br/>On our mailed heads: but other thoughts than Peace<br/>Burnt in us, when we saw the embattled squares,<br/>And squadrons of the Prince, trampling the flowers<br/>With clamour: for among them rose a cry<br/>As if to greet the king; they made a halt;<br/>The horses yelled; they clashed their arms; the drum<br/>Beat; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife;<br/>And in the blast and bray of the long horn<br/>And serpent-throated bugle, undulated<br/>The banner: anon to meet us lightly pranced<br/>Three captains out; nor ever had I seen<br/>Such thews of men: the midmost and the highest<br/>Was Arac: all about his motion clung<br/>The shadow of his sister, as the beam<br/>Of the East, that played upon them, made them glance<br/>Like those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,<br/>That glitter burnished by the frosty dark;<br/>And as the fiery Sirius alters hue,<br/>And bickers into red and emerald, shone<br/>Their morions, washed with morning, as they came.<br/><br/>And I that prated peace, when first I heard<br/>War-music, felt the blind wildbeast of force,<br/>Whose home is in the sinews of a man,<br/>Stir in me as to strike: then took the king<br/>His three broad sons; with now a wandering hand<br/>And now a pointed finger, told them all:<br/>A common light of smiles at our disguise<br/>Broke from their lips, and, ere the windy jest<br/>Had laboured down within his ample lungs,<br/>The genial giant, Arac, rolled himself<br/>Thrice in the saddle, then burst out in words.<br/><br/>'Our land invaded, 'sdeath! and he himself<br/>Your captive, yet my father wills not war:<br/>And, 'sdeath! myself, what care I, war or no?<br/>but then this question of your troth remains:<br/>And there's a downright honest meaning in her;<br/>She flies too high, she flies too high! and yet<br/>She asked but space and fairplay for her scheme;<br/>She prest and prest it on me--I myself,<br/>What know I of these things? but, life and soul!<br/>I thought her half-right talking of her wrongs;<br/>I say she flies too high, 'sdeath! what of that?<br/>I take her for the flower of womankind,<br/>And so I often told her, right or wrong,<br/>And, Prince, she can be sweet to those she loves,<br/>And, right or wrong, I care not: this is all,<br/>I stand upon her side: she made me swear it--<br/>'Sdeath--and with solemn rites by candle-light--<br/>Swear by St something--I forget her name--<br/>Her that talked down the fifty wisest men;<br/>~She~ was a princess too; and so I swore.<br/>Come, this is all; she will not: waive your claim:<br/>If not, the foughten field, what else, at once<br/>Decides it, 'sdeath! against my father's will.'<br/><br/>I lagged in answer loth to render up<br/>My precontract, and loth by brainless war<br/>To cleave the rift of difference deeper yet;<br/>Till one of those two brothers, half aside<br/>And fingering at the hair about his lip,<br/>To prick us on to combat 'Like to like!<br/>The woman's garment hid the woman's heart.'<br/>A taunt that clenched his purpose like a blow!<br/>For fiery-short was Cyril's counter-scoff,<br/>And sharp I answered, touched upon the point<br/>Where idle boys are cowards to their shame,<br/>'Decide it here: why not? we are three to three.'<br/><br/>Then spake the third 'But three to three? no more?<br/>No more, and in our noble sister's cause?<br/>More, more, for honour: every captain waits<br/>Hungry for honour, angry for his king.<br/>More, more some fifty on a side, that each<br/>May breathe himself, and quick! by overthrow<br/>Of these or those, the question settled die.'<br/><br/>'Yea,' answered I, 'for this wreath of air,<br/>This flake of rainbow flying on the highest<br/>Foam of men's deeds--this honour, if ye will.<br/>It needs must be for honour if at all:<br/>Since, what decision? if we fail, we fail,<br/>And if we win, we fail: she would not keep<br/>Her compact.' ''Sdeath! but we will send to her,'<br/>Said Arac, 'worthy reasons why she should<br/>Bide by this issue: let our missive through,<br/>And you shall have her answer by the word.'<br/><br/>'Boys!' shrieked the old king, but vainlier than a hen<br/>To her false daughters in the pool; for none<br/>Regarded; neither seemed there more to say:<br/>Back rode we to my father's camp, and found<br/>He thrice had sent a herald to the gates,<br/>To learn if Ida yet would cede our claim,<br/>Or by denial flush her babbling wells<br/>With her own people's life: three times he went:<br/>The first, he blew and blew, but none appeared:<br/>He battered at the doors; none came: the next,<br/>An awful voice within had warned him thence:<br/>The third, and those eight daughters of the plough<br/>Came sallying through the gates, and caught his hair,<br/>And so belaboured him on rib and cheek<br/>They made him wild: not less one glance he caught<br/>Through open doors of Ida stationed there<br/>Unshaken, clinging to her purpose, firm<br/>Though compassed by two armies and the noise<br/>Of arms; and standing like a stately Pine<br/>Set in a cataract on an island-crag,<br/>When storm is on the heights, and right and left<br/>Sucked from the dark heart of the long hills roll<br/>The torrents, dashed to the vale: and yet her will<br/>Bred will in me to overcome it or fall.<br/><br/>But when I told the king that I was pledged<br/>To fight in tourney for my bride, he clashed<br/>His iron palms together with a cry;<br/>Himself would tilt it out among the lads:<br/>But overborne by all his bearded lords<br/>With reasons drawn from age and state, perforce<br/>He yielded, wroth and red, with fierce demur:<br/>And many a bold knight started up in heat,<br/>And sware to combat for my claim till death.<br/><br/>All on this side the palace ran the field<br/>Flat to the garden-wall: and likewise here,<br/>Above the garden's glowing blossom-belts,<br/>A columned entry shone and marble stairs,<br/>And great bronze valves, embossed with Tomyris<br/>And what she did to Cyrus after fight,<br/>But now fast barred: so here upon the flat<br/>All that long morn the lists were hammered up,<br/>And all that morn the heralds to and fro,<br/>With message and defiance, went and came;<br/>Last, Ida's answer, in a royal hand,<br/>But shaken here and there, and rolling words<br/>Oration-like. I kissed it and I read.<br/><br/>'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,<br/>What heats of indignation when we heard<br/>Of those that iron-cramped their women's feet;<br/>Of lands in which at the altar the poor bride<br/>Gives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;<br/>Of living hearts that crack within the fire<br/>Where smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--<br/>Mothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling<br/>Their pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops<br/>The vulture, beak and talon, at the heart<br/>Made for all noble motion: and I saw<br/>That equal baseness lived in sleeker times<br/>With smoother men: the old leaven leavened all:<br/>Millions of throats would bawl for civil rights,<br/>No woman named: therefore I set my face<br/>Against all men, and lived but for mine own.<br/>Far off from men I built a fold for them:<br/>I stored it full of rich memorial:<br/>I fenced it round with gallant institutes,<br/>And biting laws to scare the beasts of prey<br/>And prospered; till a rout of saucy boys<br/>Brake on us at our books, and marred our peace,<br/>Masked like our maids, blustering I know not what<br/>Of insolence and love, some pretext held<br/>Of baby troth, invalid, since my will<br/>Sealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--<br/>I tamed my leopards: shall I not tame these?<br/>Or you? or I? for since you think me touched<br/>In honour--what, I would not aught of false--<br/>Is not our case pure? and whereas I know<br/>Your prowess, Arac, and what mother's blood<br/>You draw from, fight; you failing, I abide<br/>What end soever: fail you will not. Still<br/>Take not his life: he risked it for my own;<br/>His mother lives: yet whatsoe'er you do,<br/>Fight and fight well; strike and strike him. O dear<br/>Brothers, the woman's Angel guards you, you<br/>The sole men to be mingled with our cause,<br/>The sole men we shall prize in the after-time,<br/>Your very armour hallowed, and your statues<br/>Reared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,<br/>We plant a solid foot into the Time,<br/>And mould a generation strong to move<br/>With claim on claim from right to right, till she<br/>Whose name is yoked with children's, know herself;<br/>And Knowledge in our own land make her free,<br/>And, ever following those two crown√®d twins,<br/>Commerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain<br/>Of freedom broadcast over all the orbs<br/>Between the Northern and the Southern morn.'<br/><br/>Then came a postscript dashed across the rest.<br/>See that there be no traitors in your camp:<br/>We seem a nest of traitors--none to trust<br/>Since our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!<br/>Almost our maids were better at their homes,<br/>Than thus man-girdled here: indeed I think<br/>Our chiefest comfort is the little child<br/>Of one unworthy mother; which she left:<br/>She shall not have it back: the child shall grow<br/>To prize the authentic mother of her mind.<br/>I took it for an hour in mine own bed<br/>This morning: there the tender orphan hands<br/>Felt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence<br/>The wrath I nursed against the world: farewell.'<br/><br/>I ceased; he said, 'Stubborn, but she may sit<br/>Upon a king's right hand in thunder-storms,<br/>And breed up warriors! See now, though yourself<br/>Be dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs<br/>That swallow common sense, the spindling king,<br/>This Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.<br/>When the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,<br/>And topples down the scales; but this is fixt<br/>As are the roots of earth and base of all;<br/>Man for the field and woman for the hearth:<br/>Man for the sword and for the needle she:<br/>Man with the head and woman with the heart:<br/>Man to command and woman to obey;<br/>All else confusion. Look you! the gray mare<br/>Is ill to live with, when her whinny shrills<br/>From tile to scullery, and her small goodman<br/>Shrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell<br/>Mix with his hearth: but you--she's yet a colt--<br/>Take, break her: strongly groomed and straitly curbed<br/>She might not rank with those detestable<br/>That let the bantling scald at home, and brawl<br/>Their rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.<br/>They say she's comely; there's the fairer chance:<br/>~I~ like her none the less for rating at her!<br/>Besides, the woman wed is not as we,<br/>But suffers change of frame. A lusty brace<br/>Of twins may weed her of her folly. Boy,<br/>The bearing and the training of a child<br/>Is woman's wisdom.'<br/>Thus the hard old king:<br/>I took my leave, for it was nearly noon:<br/>I pored upon her letter which I held,<br/>And on the little clause 'take not his life:'<br/>I mused on that wild morning in the woods,<br/>And on the 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:'<br/>I thought on all the wrathful king had said,<br/>And how the strange betrothment was to end:<br/>Then I remembered that burnt sorcerer's curse<br/>That one should fight with shadows and should fall;<br/>And like a flash the weird affection came:<br/>King, camp and college turned to hollow shows;<br/>I seemed to move in old memorial tilts,<br/>And doing battle with forgotten ghosts,<br/>To dream myself the shadow of a dream:<br/>And ere I woke it was the point of noon,<br/>The lists were ready. Empanoplied and plumed<br/>We entered in, and waited, fifty there<br/>Opposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared<br/>At the barrier like a wild horn in a land<br/>Of echoes, and a moment, and once more<br/>The trumpet, and again: at which the storm<br/>Of galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears<br/>And riders front to front, until they closed<br/>In conflict with the crash of shivering points,<br/>And thunder. Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed<br/>Of fighting. On his haunches rose the steed,<br/>And into fiery splinters leapt the lance,<br/>And out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.<br/>Part sat like rocks: part reeled but kept their seats:<br/>Part rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:<br/>Part stumbled mixt with floundering horses. Down<br/>From those two bulks at Arac's side, and down<br/>From Arac's arm, as from a giant's flail,<br/>The large blows rained, as here and everywhere<br/>He rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,<br/>And all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--<br/>Shocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged<br/>With hammers; till I thought, can this be he<br/>From Gama's dwarfish loins? if this be so,<br/>The mother makes us most--and in my dream<br/>I glanced aside, and saw the palace-front<br/>Alive with fluttering scarfs and ladies' eyes,<br/>And highest, among the statues, statuelike,<br/>Between a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,<br/>With Psyche's babe, was Ida watching us,<br/>A single band of gold about her hair,<br/>Like a Saint's glory up in heaven: but she<br/>No saint--inexorable--no tenderness--<br/>Too hard, too cruel: yet she sees me fight,<br/>Yea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave<br/>Among the thickest and bore down a Prince,<br/>And Cyril, one. Yea, let me make my dream<br/>All that I would. But that large-moulded man,<br/>His visage all agrin as at a wake,<br/>Made at me through the press, and, staggering back<br/>With stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came<br/>As comes a pillar of electric cloud,<br/>Flaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,<br/>And shadowing down the champaign till it strikes<br/>On a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,<br/>And twists the grain with such a roar that Earth<br/>Reels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything<br/>Game way before him: only Florian, he<br/>That loved me closer than his own right eye,<br/>Thrust in between; but Arac rode him down:<br/>And Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,<br/>With Psyche's colour round his helmet, tough,<br/>Strong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;<br/>But tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote<br/>And threw him: last I spurred; I felt my veins<br/>Stretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,<br/>And sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,<br/>Till I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,<br/>I did but shear a feather, and dream and truth<br/>Flowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.<br/><br/><br/>Home they brought her warrior dead:<br/>She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:<br/>All her maidens, watching, said,<br/>'She must weep or she will die.'<br/><br/>Then they praised him, soft and low,<br/>Called him worthy to be loved,<br/>Truest friend and noblest foe;<br/>Yet she neither spoke nor moved.<br/><br/>Stole a maiden from her place,<br/>Lightly to the warrior stept,<br/>Took the face-cloth from the face;<br/>Yet she neither moved nor wept.<br/><br/>Rose a nurse of ninety years,<br/>Set his child upon her knee--<br/>Like summer tempest came her tears--<br/>'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'
