# üíÆ Werner: First Draft by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    ACT I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A ruinous chateau on the Silesian frontier of Bohemia_.<br/><br/>_Josepha_. THE storm is at it's height--how the wind howls,<br/>Like an unearthly voice, through these lone chambers!<br/>And the rain patters on the flapping casement<br/>Which quivers in it's frame--the night is starless--<br/>Yet cheerly Werner! still our hearts are warm:<br/>The tempest is without, or should be so--<br/>For we are sheltered here where Fortune's clouds<br/>May roll all harmless o'er us as the wrath<br/>Of these wild elements that menace now,<br/>Yet do not reach us.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_without attending, and walking disturbedly,<br/>speaking to himself_). No--'Tis past--'tis blighted,<br/>The last faint hope to which my withered fortune<br/>Clung with a feeble and a fluttering grasp,<br/>Yet clung convulsively--for twas the _last_--<br/>Is broken with the rest: would that my heart were!<br/>But there is pride, and passion's war within,<br/>Which give my breast vitality to suffer,<br/>As it hath suffered through long years till now.<br/>My father's wrath extends beyond the grave,<br/>And haunts me in the shape of Stralenheim!<br/>He revels in my fathers palace--I--<br/>Exiled--disherited--a nameless outcast!<br/>                                                     [_Werner pauses_.<br/>My boy, too, where and what is he?--my father<br/>Might well have limited his curse to me.<br/>If that my heritage had passed to Ulric,<br/>I had not mourned my own less happy lot.<br/>No--No--all's past--all torn away.<br/><br/>_Josepha_.                        Dear Werner,<br/>Oh banish these discomfortable thoughts<br/>That thus contend within you: we are poor,<br/>So we have ever been--but I remember<br/>The time when thy Josepha's smile could turn<br/>Thy heart to hers--despite of every ill.<br/>So let it now--alas! you hear me not.<br/><br/>_Werner_. What said you?--let it pass--no matter what--<br/>Think me not churlish, Sweet, I am not well.<br/>My brain is hot and busy--long fatigue<br/>And last night's watching have oppressed me much.<br/><br/>_Josepha_. Then get thee to thy couch. I do perceive<br/>In thy pale cheek and in thy bloodshot eye<br/>A strange distemperature--nay, as a boon,<br/>I do entreat thee to thy rest.<br/><br/>_Werner_.                      My _rest!_<br/>Well--be it so--Good Night!<br/><br/>_Josepha_.                 Thy hand is burning;<br/>I will prepare a potion:--peace be with thee--<br/>Tomorrow's dawn I trust will find thee healthful;<br/>And, then, our Ulric may perchance--<br/><br/>_Werner_. _Our_ Ulric--thine and mine--our only boy--<br/>Curse on his father and his father's Sire!<br/>(For, if it is so, I will render back<br/>A curse that Heaven will hear as well as his),<br/>Our Ulric by his father's fault or folly,<br/>And by my father's unrelenting pride,<br/>Is at this hour, perchance, undone. This night<br/>That shelters us may shower it's wrath on him--<br/>A homeless beggar for his parent's sin--<br/>Thy sin and mine--Thy child and mine atones--<br/>Our Ulric--Woman!--I'll to no bed to-night--<br/>There is no pillow for my thoughts.<br/><br/>_Josepha_.                         What words,<br/>What fearful words are these! what may they mean?<br/><br/>_Werner_. Look on me--thou hast known me, hitherto,<br/>As an oppressed, but yet a humble creature;<br/>By birth predestined to the yoke I've borne.<br/>Till now I've borne it patiently, at least,<br/>In bitter silence--but the hour is come,<br/>That should and shall behold me as I was,<br/>And ought again to be--<br/><br/>_Josepha_.               I know not what<br/>Thy mystery may tend to, but my fate--<br/>My heart--my will--my love are linked with thine,<br/>And I would share thy sorrow: lay it open.<br/><br/>_Werner_. Thou see'st the son of Count--but let it pass--<br/>I forfeited the name in wedding thee:<br/>That fault of many faults a father's pride<br/>Proclaimed the last and worst--and, from that hour,<br/>He disavowed, disherited, debased<br/>A wayward son----tis a long tale--too long--<br/>And I am heartsick of the heavy thought.<br/><br/>_Josepha_. Oh, I could weep--but that were little solace:<br/>Yet tell the rest--or, if thou wilt not, say--<br/>Yet say--why, through long years, from me withheld,<br/>This fearful secret that hath gnawed thy soul?<br/><br/>_Werner_. Why? had it not been base to call on thee<br/>For patience and for pity--to awake<br/>The thirst of grandeur in thy gentle spirit--<br/>To tell thee what thou shouldst have been--the wife<br/>Of one, in power--birth--wealth, preeminent--<br/>Then, sudden quailing in that lofty tone,<br/>To bid thee soothe thy husband--peasant Werner?<br/><br/>_Josepha_. I would thou wert, indeed, the peasant Werner;<br/>For then thy soul had been of calmer mould,<br/>And suited to thy lot----<br/><br/>_Werner_.                 Was it not so?<br/>Beneath a humble name and garb--the which<br/>My youthful riot and a father's frown,<br/>Too justly fixed upon me, had compelled<br/>My bowed down spirit to assume too well--<br/>Since it deceived the world, myself, and thee:<br/>I linked my lot irrevocably with thine--<br/>And I have loved thee deeply--long and dearly--<br/>Even as I love thee still--but these late crosses,<br/>And most of all the last,--have maddened me;<br/>And I am wild and wayward as in youth,<br/>Ere I beheld thee--<br/><br/>_Josepha_.          Would thou never hadst!<br/>Since I have been a blight upon thy hope,<br/>And marred alike the present and the future.<br/><br/>_Werner_. Yet say not so--for all that I have known<br/>Of true and calm content--of love--of peace--<br/>Has been with thee and from thee: wert thou not,<br/>I were a lonely and self-loathing thing.<br/>Ulric has left us! all, save thou, have left me!<br/>Father and son--Fortune--Fame--Power--Ambition--<br/>The ties of being--the high soul of man--<br/>All save the long remorse--the consciousness,<br/>The curse of living on, regretting life<br/>Mispent in miserably gazing upward,<br/>While others soared--Away, I'll think no more.<br/><br/>_Josepha_. But Ulric--wherefore didst thou let him leave<br/>His home and us? tis now three weary years.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_interrupting her quickly_).<br/>Since my hard father, half-relenting, sent<br/>The offer of a scanty stipend which<br/>I needs must earn by rendering up my son--<br/>Fool that I was--I thought this quick compliance,<br/>And never more assuming in myself<br/>The haught name of my house would soften him--<br/>And for our child secure the heritage<br/>Forfeit in me forever. Since that hour,<br/>Till the last year, the wretched pittance came--<br/>Then ceased with every tidings of my son<br/>And Sire--till late I heard the last had ceased<br/>To live--and unforgiving died--Oh God!<br/><br/>_Josepha_. Was it for this our Ulric left us so?<br/>Thou dids't deceive me then--he went not forth<br/>To join the legions of Count Tilly's war?<br/><br/>_Werner_. I know not--he had left my father's castle,<br/>Some months before his death--but why?--but why?<br/>Left it as I did ere his birth, perchance,<br/>Like me an outcast. Old age had not made<br/>My father meeker--and my son, Alas!<br/>Too much his Sire resembled----<br/><br/>_Josepha_.                     Yet there's comfort.<br/>Restrain thy wandering Spirit--Ulric cannot<br/>Have left his native land--thou dost not know,<br/>Though it looks strangely, thy Sire and he<br/>In anger parted--Hope is left us still.<br/><br/>_Werner_. The best hope that I ever held in youth,<br/>When every pulse was life, each thought a joy,<br/>(Yet not irrationally sanguine, since<br/>My birth bespoke high thoughts,) hath lured and left me.<br/>I will not be a dreamer in mine age--<br/>The hunter of a shadow--let _boys hope_:<br/>Of Hope I now know nothing but the name--<br/>And that's a sound which jars upon my heart.<br/>I've wearied thee--Good night--my patient Love!<br/><br/>_Josepha_. I must not leave thee thus--my husband--friend--<br/>My heart is rent in twain for thee--I scarce<br/>Dare greet thee as I would, lest that my love<br/>Should seem officious and ill timed:--'tis early--<br/>Yet rest were as a healing balm to thee--<br/>Then once again--Good night!<br/><br/>_Voice Without_.             What Ho--lights ho!<br/><br/>SCENE II.<br/><br/>_Josepha_. What noise is that? 'tis nearer--hush! they knock.<br/>                     [_A knocking heard at the gate_--WERNER _starts_.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_aside_). It may be that the bloodhounds of the villain,<br/>Who long has tracked me, have approached at last:<br/>I'll not be taken tamely.<br/><br/>_Josepha_.                'Twas the voice,<br/>The single voice of some lone traveller.<br/>I'll to the door.<br/><br/>_Werner_.         No--stay thou here--again!<br/>                                 [_Knocking repeated. Opens the door_.<br/>Well--Sir--your pleasure?<br/><br/>                   _Enter_ CARL _the Bavarian_.<br/><br/>_Carl_.                   Thanks most worthy Sir!<br/>My pleasure, for to-night, depends on yours--<br/>I'm weary, wet, and wayworn--without shelter,<br/>Unless you please to grant it.<br/><br/>_Josepha_.                    You shall have it,<br/>Such as this ruinous mansion may afford:<br/>Tis spacious, but too cold and crazy now<br/>For Hospitality's more cordial welcome:<br/>But as it is 'tis yours.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_to his wife_).   Why say ye so?<br/>At once such hearty greeting to a stranger?<br/>At such a lonely hour, too--<br/><br/>_Josepha_ (_in reply to Werner_). Nay--he's honest.<br/>There is trust-worthiness in his blunt looks.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_to Josepha_).<br/>"Trustworthiness in looks!" I'll trust no looks!<br/>I look into men's faces for their age,<br/>Not for their actions--had he Adam's brow,<br/>Open and goodly as before the fall,<br/>I've lived too long to trust the frankest aspect.<br/>(_To Carl_) Whence come you Sir?<br/><br/>_Carl_.                         From Frankfort, on my way<br/>To my own country--I've a companion too--<br/>He tarries now behind:--an hour ago,<br/>On reaching that same river on your frontier,<br/>We found it swoln by storms--a stranger's carriage,<br/>Despite the current, drawn by sturdy mules,<br/>Essayed to pass, and nearly reached the middle<br/>Of that which was the _ford_ in gentler weather,<br/>When down came driver, carriage, mules, and all--<br/>You may suppose the worthy Lord within<br/>Fared ill enough:--worse still he might have suffered,<br/>But that my comrade and myself rushed in,<br/>And with main strength and some good luck beside,<br/>Dislodged and saved him: he'll be here anon.<br/>His equipage by this time is at Dresden--<br/>I left it floating that way.<br/><br/>_Werner_.                   Where is he?<br/><br/>_Carl_. Hitherward on his way, even like myself--<br/>We saw the light and made for the nearest shelter:<br/>You'll not deny us for a single night?<br/>You've room enough, methinks--and this vast ruin<br/>Will not be worse for three more guests.<br/><br/>_Werner_.                               Two more:<br/>And thou?--well--be it so--(_aside_) (tonight will soon<br/>Be overpast: they shall not stay tomorrow)--<br/>Know you the name of him you saved?<br/><br/>_Carl_.                             Not I!<br/>I think I heard him called a Baron Something--<br/>But was too chill to stay and hear his titles:<br/>You know they are sometimes tedious in the reckoning,<br/>If counted over by the noble wearer.<br/>Has't any wine? I'm wet, stung to the marrow--<br/>My comrade waited to escort the Baron:<br/>They will be here, anon--they, too, want cheering:<br/>I'll taste for them, if it please you, courteous host!<br/><br/>_Josepha_. Such as our vintage is shall give you welcome:<br/>I'll bring you some anon.                                 [_goes out_.<br/><br/>_Carl_ (_looking round_). A goodly mansion!<br/>And has been nobly tenanted, I doubt not.<br/>This worn magnificence some day has shone<br/>On light hearts and long revels--those torn banners<br/>Have waved o'er courtly guests--and yon huge lamp<br/>High blazed through many a midnight--I could wish<br/>My lot had led me here in those gay times!<br/>Your days, my host, must pass but heavily.<br/>Are you the vassal of these antient chiefs,<br/>Whose heir wastes elsewhere their fast melting hoards,<br/>And placed to keep their cobwebs company?<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_who has been absorbed in thought till the latter<br/>part of his speech_). A Vassal!--I a vassal!--_who_ accosts me<br/>With such familiar question?--(_checks himself and says<br/>aside_)--Down startled pride!<br/>Have not long years of wretchedness yet quenched thee,<br/>And, suffering evil, wilt thou start at scorn?<br/>(_To Carl_.) Sir! if I boast no birth--and, as you see,<br/>My state bespeaks none--still, no being breathes<br/>Who calls me slave or servant.--Like yourself<br/>I am a stranger here--a lonely guest--<br/>But, for a time, on sufferance. On my way,<br/>From--a far distant city--Sickness seized,<br/>And long detained me in the neighbouring hamlet.<br/>The Intendant of the owner of this castle,<br/>Then uninhabited, with kind intent,<br/>Permitted me to wait returning health<br/>Within these walls--more sheltered than the cot<br/>Of humble peasants.<br/><br/>_Carl_.             Worthy Sir, your mercy!<br/>I meant not to offend you--plain of speech,<br/>And blunt in apprehension, I do judge<br/>Men's station from their seeming--but themselves<br/>From acts alone. You bid me share your shelter,<br/>And I am bound to you; and had you been<br/>The lowliest vassal had not thanked you less,<br/>Than I do now, believing you his better,<br/>Perhaps my own superior--<br/><br/>_Werner_.                 What imports it?<br/>What--who I am--or whence--you are welcome--sit--<br/>You shall have cheer anon. (_walks disturbedly aside_)<br/><br/>_Carl_ (_to himself_). Here's a strange fellow!<br/>Wild, churlish, angry--_why_, I know not, seek not.<br/>Would that the wine were come! my doublet's wet,<br/>But my throat dry as Summer's drought in desarts.<br/>Ah--here it sparkles!<br/><br/>   _Enter_ JOSEPHA _with wine in flask--and a cup. As she pours<br/>     it out a Voice is heard without calling at a distance_.<br/>         WERNER _starts_--JOSEPHA _listens tremulously_.<br/><br/>_Werner_.            That voice--that voice--Hark!<br/>No--no--tis silent--Sir--I say--that voice--<br/>Whose is it--speak--<br/><br/>_Carl_ (_drinking unconcernedly_).<br/>                    Whose is it? faith, I know not--<br/>And, yet, 'tis my companion's: he's like you,<br/>And does not care to tell his name and station.<br/>                                        [_The voice again and nearer_.<br/><br/>_Josepha_. 'Tis his--I knew it--Ulric!--Ulric!--Ulric!<br/>                                 [_She drops the wine and rushes out_.<br/><br/>_Carl_. The flask's unhurt--but every drop is spilt.<br/>Confound the voice! I say--would he were dumb!<br/>And faith! to me, he has been nearly so--<br/>A silent and unsocial travelling mate.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_stands in agitation gazing towards the door_).<br/>If it be he--I cannot move to meet him.<br/>Yes--it must be so--there is no such voice<br/>That so could sound and shake me: he is here,<br/>And I am--<br/><br/>                       _Enter_ STRALENHEIM.<br/><br/>_Werner_ (_turns and sees him_). A curse upon thee, stranger!<br/>Where dids't thou learn a tone so like my boy's?<br/>Thou mock bird of my hopes--a curse upon thee!<br/>Out! Out! I say. Thou shalt not harbour here.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. What means the peasant? knows he unto whom<br/>He dares address this language?<br/><br/>_Carl_.                         Noble Sir!<br/>Pray heed him not--he's Phrenzy's next door neighbour,<br/>And full of these strange starts and causeless jarrings.<br/><br/>_Werner_. Oh, that long wished for voice!--I dreamed of it--<br/>And then it did elude me--then--and now.<br/><br/>     _Enter_ ULRIC _and_ JOSEPHA. WERNER _falls on his neck_.<br/><br/>Oh God! forgive, for thou dids't not forget me.<br/>Although I murmured--tis--it is my Son!<br/><br/>_Josepha_. Aye, 'tis dear Ulric--yet, methinks, he's changed, too:<br/>His cheek is tanned, his frame more firmly knit!<br/>That scar, too, dearest Ulric--I do fear me--<br/>Thou hast been battling with these heretics,<br/>And that's a Swedish token on thy brow.<br/><br/>_Ulric_. My heart is glad with yours--we meet like those<br/>Who never would have parted:--of the past<br/>You shall know more anon--but, here's a guest<br/>That asks a gentle welcome. Noble Baron,<br/>My father's silence looks discourtesy:<br/>Yet must I plead his pardon--'tis his love<br/>Of a long truant that has rapt him, thus,<br/>From hospitable greeting--you'll be seated--<br/>And, Father, we will sup like famished hunters.<br/><br/>                     JOSEPHA _goes out here_.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. I have much need of rest: no more refreshment!<br/>Were all my people housed within the hamlet,<br/>Or can they follow?<br/><br/>_Ulric_.           Not to night I fear.<br/>They staid in hope the damaged Cabriole<br/>Might, with the dawn of day, have such repairs,<br/>As circumstance admits of.<br/><br/>_Carl_.                    Nay--that's hopeless.<br/>They must not only mend but draw it too.<br/>The mules are drowned--a murrain on them both!<br/>One kicked me as I would have helped him on.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. It is most irksome to me--this delay.<br/>I was for Prague on business of great moment.<br/><br/>_Werner_. For Prague--Sir--Say you?--<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_.                        Yes, my host! for Prague.<br/>And these vile floods and villainous cross roads<br/>Steal my time from it's uses--but--my people?<br/>Where do they shelter?<br/><br/>_Ulric_.               In the boatman's shed,<br/>Near to the ferry: you mistook the ford--<br/>Tis higher to the right:--their entertainment<br/>Will be but rough--but 'tis a single night,<br/>And they had best be guardians of the baggage.<br/>The shed will hold the weather from their sleep,<br/>The woodfire warm them--and, for beds, a cloak<br/>Is swansdown to a seasoned traveller:<br/>It has been mine for many a moon, and may<br/>Tonight, for aught it recks me.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_.                  And tomorrow<br/>I must be on my journey--and betimes.<br/>It is not more than three days travel, hence,<br/>To Mansfeldt Castle.<br/><br/>_Werner and Ulric_. Mansfeldt Castle!--<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_.                           Aye!<br/>For thither tends my progress--so, betimes,<br/>Mine host I would be stirring--think of that!<br/>And let me find my couch of rest at present.<br/><br/>_Werner_. You shall Sir--but--to Mansfeldt!--<br/>                      [ULRIC _stops his father and says aside to him_,<br/>                                             _Silence--father--_<br/>Whate'er it be that shakes you thus--_tread down_--<br/>(_To Stralenheim_) My father, Sir, was born not far from Prague,<br/>And knows it's environs--and, when he hears,<br/>The name endeared to him by native thoughts,<br/>He would ask of it, and it's habitants--<br/>You will excuse his plain blunt mode of question.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. Indeed, perchance, then, he may aid my search.<br/>Pray, know you aught of one named Werner? who<br/>(But he no doubt has passed through many names),<br/>Lived long in Hamburgh--and has thence been traced<br/>Into Silesia--and not far from hence--<br/>But there we lost him; he who can disclose<br/>Aught of him, or his hiding-place, will find<br/>Advantage in revealing it.<br/><br/>_Ulric_.                  Why so--Sir?<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. There are strong reasons to suspect this man<br/>Of crimes against the State--league with Swedes--<br/>And other evil acts of moment:--he<br/>Who shall deliver him, bound hand and foot,<br/>Will benefit his country and himself:<br/>I will reward him doubly too.<br/><br/>_Ulric_.                      You know him?<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. He never met my eyes--but Circumstance<br/>Has led me to near knowledge of the man.<br/>He is a villain--and an enemy<br/>To all men--most to me! If earth contain him,<br/>He shall be found and fettered: I have hopes,<br/>By traces which tomorrow will unravel,<br/>A fresh clue to his lurking spot is nigh.<br/><br/>_Carl_. And, if I find it, I will break the thread.<br/>What, all the world against one luckless wight!<br/>And he a fugitive--I would I knew him!<br/><br/>_Ulric_. You'd help him to escape--is it not so?<br/><br/>_Carl_. I would, indeed!<br/><br/>_Ulric_.                 The greater greenhorn you!<br/>I would secure him--nay--I will do so.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. If it be so--my gratitude for aid,<br/>And rescue of my life from the wild waters,<br/>Will double in it's strength and it's requital.<br/>Your father, too, perhaps can help our search?<br/><br/>_Werner_. _I_ turn a spy--no--not for _Mansfeldt Castle_,<br/>And all the broad domain it frowns upon.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. Mansfeldt again!--you know it then? perchance,<br/>You also know the story of it's lords?<br/><br/>_Werner_. Whate'er I know, there is no bribe of thine<br/>Can swerve me to the crooked path thou pointest.<br/>The chamber's ready, which your rest demands.<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_ (_aside_).<br/>'Tis strange--this peasant's tone is wondrous high,<br/>His air imperious--and his eye shines out<br/>As wont to look command with a quick glance--<br/>His garb befits him not--why, he may be<br/>The man I look for! now, I look again,<br/>There is the very lip--short curling lip--<br/>And the oerjutting eye-brow dark and large,<br/>And the peculiar wild variety<br/>Of feature, even unto the Viper's eye,<br/>Of that detested race, and it's descendant<br/>Who stands alone between me and a power,<br/>Which Princes gaze at with unquiet eyes!<br/>This is no peasant--but, whate'er he be,<br/>Tomorrow shall secure him and unfold.<br/><br/>_Ulric_. It will not please you, Sir, then to remain<br/>With us beyond tomorrow?<br/><br/>_Stralenheim_. Nay--I do not say so--there is no haste.<br/>And now I think again--I'll tarry here--<br/>Perhaps until the floods abate--we'll see--<br/>In the mean time--to my chamber--so--Good Night!<br/>                                                  [_Exit with_ WERNER.<br/><br/>_Werner_. This way, Sir.<br/><br/>_Carl_. And I to mine: pray, where are we to rest?<br/>We'll sup within--<br/><br/>_Ulric_.          What matter where--there's room.<br/><br/>_Carl_. I would fain see my way through this vast ruin;<br/>Come take the lamp, and we'll explore together.<br/><br/>_Josepha_ (_meeting them_). And I will with my son.<br/><br/>_Ulric_.                          Nay--stay--dear mother!<br/>These chilly damps and the cold rush of winds<br/>Fling a rough paleness o'er thy delicate cheek--<br/>And thou seem'st lovely in thy sickliness<br/>Of most transparent beauty:--but it grieves me.<br/>Nay! tarry here by the blaze of the bright hearth:--<br/>I will return anon--and we have much<br/>To listen and impart. Come, Carl, we'll find<br/>Some gorgeous canopy, and, thence, unroost<br/>It's present bedfellows the bats--and thou<br/>Shalt slumber underneath a velvet cloud<br/>That mantles o'er the couch of some dead Countess.<br/>                                             [_Exit_ CARL _and_ ULRIC.<br/><br/>_Josepha_ (_sola_). It was my joy to see him--nothing more<br/>I should have said--which sent my gush of blood<br/>Back on my full heart with a dancing tide:<br/>It was my weary hope's unthought fulfilment,<br/>My agony of mother-feelings curdled<br/>At once in gathered rapture--which did change<br/>My cheek into the hue of fainting Nature.<br/>I should have answered thus--and yet I could not:<br/>For though 'twas true--it was not all the truth.<br/>I have much suffered in the thought of Werner's<br/>Late deep distemperature of mind and fortunes,<br/>Which since have almost driven him into phrenzy:--<br/>And though that I would soothe, not share, such passions,<br/>And show not how they shake me:--when alone,<br/>I feel them prey upon me by reflection,<br/>And want the very solace I bestowed;<br/>And which, it seems, I cannot give and have.<br/>Ulric must be my comforter--his father's<br/>Hath long been the most melancholy soul<br/>That ever hovered o'er the verge of Madness:<br/>And, better, had he leapt into it's gulph:<br/>Though to the Mad thoughts are realities,<br/>Yet they can play with sorrow--and live on.<br/>But with the mind of consciousness and care<br/>The body wears to ruin, and the struggle,<br/>However long, is deadly----He is lost,<br/>And all around him tasteless:--in his mirth<br/>His very laughter moves me oft to tears,<br/>And I have turned to hide them--for, in him,<br/>As Sunshine glittering o'er unburied bones----<br/>Soft--he is here.----<br/><br/>_Werner_.             Josepha--where is Ulric?<br/><br/>_Josepha_. Gone with the other stranger to gaze o'er<br/>These shattered corridors, and spread themselves<br/>A pillow with their mantles, in the least ruinous:<br/>I must replenish the diminished hearth<br/>In the inner chamber--the repast is ready,<br/>And Ulric will be here again.--
