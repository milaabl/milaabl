# üíÆ The Glove by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    "Heigho!" yawned one day King Francis,<br/>"Distance all value enhances.<br/>When a man's busy, why, leisure<br/>Strikes him as wonderful pleasure:<br/>Faith, and at leisure once is he?<br/>Straightway he wants to be busy.<br/>Here we've got peace; and aghast I'm<br/>Caught thinking war the true pastime.<br/>Is there a reason in metre?<br/>Give us your speech, master Peter!"<br/>I who, if mortal dare say so,<br/>Ne'er am at loss with my Naso<br/>"Sire," I replied, "joys prove cloudlets:<br/>"Men are the merest Ixions"--<br/>Here the King whistled aloud, "Let's<br/>--Heigho--go look at our lions."<br/>Such are the sorrowful chances<br/>If you talk fine to King Francis.<br/><br/>And so, to the courtyard proceeding,<br/>Our company, Francis was leading,<br/>Increased by new followers tenfold<br/>Before he arrived at the penfold;<br/>Lords, ladies, like clouds which bedizen<br/>At sunset the western horizon.<br/>And Sir De Lorge pressed 'mid the foremost<br/>With the dame he professed to adore most.<br/>Oh, what a face!  One by fits eyed<br/>Her, and the horrible pitside;<br/>For the penfold surrounded a hollow<br/>Which led where the eye scarce dared follow<br/>And shelved to the chamber secluded<br/>Where Bluebeard, the great lion, brooded.<br/><br/>The King hailed his keeper, an Arab<br/>As glossy and black as a scarab,<br/>And bade him make sport and at once stir<br/>Up and out of his den the old monster.<br/>They opened a hole in the wire-work<br/>Across it, and dropped there a firework,<br/>And fled: one's heart's beating redoubled;<br/>A pause, while the pit's mouth was troubled,<br/>The blackness and silence so utter,<br/>By the firework's slow sparkling and sputter;<br/>Then earth in a sudden contortion<br/>Gave out to our gaze her abortion.<br/>Such a brute! Were I friend Clement Marot<br/>(Whose experience of nature's but narrow<br/>And whose faculties move in no small mist<br/>When he versifies David the Psalmist)<br/>I should study that brute to describe you<br/>Illum Juda Leonem de Tribu.<br/>One's whole blood grew curdling and creepy<br/>To see the black mane, vast and heapy,<br/>The tail in the air stiff and straining<br/>The wide eyes, nor waxing nor waning,<br/>As over the barrier which bounded<br/>His platform, and us who surrounded<br/>The barrier, they reached and they rested<br/>On space that might stand him in best stead:<br/>For who knew, he thought, what the amazement,<br/>The eruption of clatter and blaze meant,<br/>And if, in this minute of wonder,<br/>No outlet, 'mid lightning and thunder,<br/>Lay broad, and, his shackles all shivered,<br/>The lion at last was delivered?<br/>Ay, that was the open sky o'erhead!<br/>And you saw by the flash on his forehead,<br/>By the hope in those eyes wide and steady,<br/>He was leagues in the desert already<br/>Driving the flocks up the mountain<br/>Or catlike couched hard by the fountain<br/>To waylay the date-gathering negress:<br/>So guarded he entrance or egress.<br/>"How he stands!" quoth the King: "we may well swear,<br/>(No novice, we've won our spurs elsewhere<br/>And so can afford the confession)<br/>We exercise wholesome discretion<br/>In keeping aloof from his threshold;<br/>Once hold you, those jaws want no fresh hold,<br/>Their first would too pleasantly purloin<br/>The visitor's brisket or surloin:<br/>But who's he would prove so fool-hardy?<br/>Not the best man of Marignan, pardie!"<br/><br/>The sentence no sooner was uttered,<br/>Than over the rails a glove fluttered,<br/>Fell close to the lion, and rested:<br/>The dame 'twas, who flung it and jested<br/>With life so, De Lorge had been wooing<br/>For months past; he sat there pursuing<br/>His suit, weighing out with nonchalance<br/>Fine speeches like gold from a balance.<br/><br/>Sound the trumpet, no true knight's a tarrier!<br/>De Lorge made one leap at the barrier,<br/>Walked straight to the glove--while the lion<br/>Ne'er moved, kept his far-reaching eye on<br/>The palm-tree-edged desert-spring's sapphire,<br/>And the musky oiled skin of the Kaffir--<br/>Picked it up, and as calmly retreated,<br/>Leaped back where the lady was seated,<br/>And full in the face of its owner<br/>Flung the glove.<br/><br/>"Your heart's queen, you dethrone her?<br/>So should I!"--cried the King--"'twas mere vanity<br/>Not love set that task to humanity!"<br/>Lords and ladies alike turned with loathing<br/>From such a proved wolf in sheep's clothing.<br/><br/>Not so, I; for I caught an expression<br/>In her brow's undisturbed self-possession<br/>Amid the Court's scoffing and merriment,<br/>As if from no pleasing experiment<br/>She rose, yet of pain not much heedful<br/>So long as the process was needful,--<br/>As if she had tried in a crucible,<br/>To what "speeches like gold" were reducible,<br/>And, finding the finest prove copper,<br/>Felt the smoke in her face was but proper;<br/>To know what she had not to trust to,<br/>Was worth all the ashes and dust too.<br/>She went out 'mid hooting and laughter;<br/>Clement Marot stayed; I followed after,<br/>And asked, as a grace, what it all meant?<br/>If she wished not the rash deed's recalment?<br/>For I"--so I spoke--"am a poet:<br/>Human nature,--behoves that I know it!"<br/><br/>She told me, "Too long had I heard<br/>Of the deed proved alone by the word:<br/>For my love--what De Lorge would not dare!<br/>With my scorn--what De Lorge could compare!<br/>And the endless descriptions of death<br/>He would brave when my lip formed a breath,<br/>I must reckon as braved, or, of course,<br/>Doubt his word--and moreover, perforce,<br/>For such gifts as no lady could spurn,<br/>Must offer my love in return.<br/>When I looked on your lion, it brought<br/>All the dangers at once to my thought,<br/>Encountered by all sorts of men,<br/>Before he was lodged in his den--<br/>From the poor slave whose club or bare hands<br/>Dug the trap, set the snare on the sands,<br/>With no King and no Court to applaud,<br/>By no shame, should he shrink, overawed,<br/>Yet to capture the creature made shift,<br/>That his rude boys might laugh at the gift<br/>--To the page who last leaped o'er the fence<br/>Of the pit, on no greater pretence<br/>Than to get back the bonnet he dropped,<br/>Lest his pay for a week should be stopped.<br/>So, wiser I judged it to make<br/>One trial what 'death for my sake'<br/>Really meant, while the power was yet mine,<br/><br/>Than to wait until time should define<br/>Such a phrase not so simply as I,<br/>Who took it to mean just 'to die.'<br/>The blow a glove gives is but weak:<br/>Does the mark yet discolour my cheek?<br/>But when the heart suffers a blow,<br/>Will the pain pass so soon, do you know?"<br/><br/>I looked, as away she was sweeping.<br/>And saw a youth eagerly keeping<br/>As close as he dared to the doorway.<br/>No doubt that a noble should more weigh<br/>His life than befits a plebeian;<br/>And yet, had our brute been Nemean--<br/>(I judge by a certain calm fervour<br/>The youth stepped with, forward to serve her)<br/>--He'd have scarce thought you did him the worst turn<br/>If you whispered "Friend, what you'd get, first earn!"<br/>And when, shortly after, she carried<br/>Her shame from the Court, and they married,<br/>To that marriage some happiness, maugre<br/>The voice of the Court, I dared augur.<br/><br/>For De Lorge, he made women with men vie,<br/>Those in wonder and praise, these in envy;<br/>And in short stood so plain a head taller.<br/>That he wooed and won... how do you call her?<br/>The beauty, that rose in the sequel<br/>To the King's love, who loved her a week well.<br/>And 'twas noticed he never would honour<br/>De Lorge (who looked daggers upon her)<br/>With the easy commission of stretching<br/>His legs in the service, and fetching<br/>His wife, from her chamber, those straying<br/>Sad gloves she was always mislaying,<br/>While the King took the closet to chat in,--<br/>But of course this adventure came pat in.<br/>And never the King told the story,<br/>How bringing a glove brought such glory,<br/>But the wife smiled--"His nerves are grown firmer:<br/>Mine he brings now and utters no murmur."<br/><br/>Venienti occurrite morbo!<br/>With which moral I drop my theorbo.
