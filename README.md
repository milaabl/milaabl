  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Chimney-Sweeper by *William Blake*

<p>
    When my mother died I was very young,<br/>And my father sold me while yet my tongue<br/>Could scarcely cry "Weep! weep! weep! weep!"<br/>So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.<br/><br/>There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,<br/>That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so I said,<br/>"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head's bare,<br/>You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."<br/><br/>And so he was quiet, and that very night,<br/>As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!--<br/>That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,<br/>Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.<br/><br/>And by came an angel, who had a bright key,<br/>And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;<br/>Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,<br/>And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.<br/><br/>Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,<br/>They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;<br/>And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,<br/>He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.<br/><br/>And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,<br/>And got with our bags and our brushes to work.<br/>Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:<br/>So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.
</p>
