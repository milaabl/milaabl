  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Hymn of Apollo by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,<br/>Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries<br/>From the broad moonlight of the sky,<br/>Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes,--<br/>Waken me when their Mother, the gray Dawn,<br/>Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.<br/><br/>Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,<br/>I walk over the mountains and the waves,<br/>Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;<br/>My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves<br/>Are filled with my bright presence, and the air<br/>Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.<br/><br/>The sunbeams are my shafts, with which I kill<br/>Deceit, that loves the night and fears the day;<br/>All men who do or even imagine ill<br/>Fly me, and from the glory of my ray<br/>Good minds and open actions take new might,<br/>Until diminished by the reign of Night.<br/><br/>I feed the clouds, the rainbows and the flowers<br/>With their aethereal colours; the moon's globe<br/>And the pure stars in their eternal bowers<br/>Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;<br/>Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine<br/>Are portions of one power, which is mine.<br/><br/>I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven,<br/>Then with unwilling steps I wander down<br/>Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;<br/>For grief that I depart they weep and frown:<br/>What look is more delightful than the smile<br/>With which I soothe them from the western isle?<br/><br/>I am the eye with which the Universe<br/>Beholds itself and knows itself divine;<br/>All harmony of instrument or verse,<br/>All prophecy, all medicine is mine,<br/>All light of art or nature;--to my song<br/>Victory and praise in its own right belong.
</p>
