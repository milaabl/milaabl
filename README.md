# üíÆ The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (excerpt) by *William Morris*

<p>
    But therewith the sun rose upward and lightened all the earth,<br/>And the light flashed up to the heavens from the rims of the glorious girth;<br/>But they twain arose together, and with both her palms outspread,<br/>And bathed in the light returning, she cried aloud and said:<br/>"All hail, O Day and thy Sons, and thy kin of the coloured things!<br/>Hail, following Night, and thy Daughter that leadeth thy wavering wings!<br/>Look down With unangry eyes on us today alive,<br/>And give us the hearts victorious, and the gain for which we strive!<br/>All hail, ye Lords of God-home, and ye Queens of the House of Gold!<br/>Hail, thou dear Earth that bearest, and thou Wealth of field and fold!<br/>Give us, your noble children, the glory of wisdom and speech,<br/>And the hearts and the hands of healing, and the mouths and hands that teach!"<br/><br/>Then they turned and were knit together; and oft and o'er again<br/>They craved, and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain.<br/>Then Sigurd looketh upon her, and the words from his heart arise:<br/>"Thou art the fairest of earth, and the wisest of the wise;<br/>O who art thou that lovest? I am Sigurd, e'en as I told;<br/>I have slain the Foe of the Gods, and gotten the Ancient Gold;<br/>And great were the gain of thy love, and the gift of mine earthly days,<br/>If we twain should never sunder as we wend on the changing ways.<br/>O who art thou that lovest, thou fairest of all things born?<br/>And what meanest thy sleep and thy slumber in the wilderness forlorn?"<br/><br/>She said: "I am one that loveth: I was born of the earthly folk,<br/>But of old Allfather took me from the Kings and their wedding yoke:<br/>And he called me the Victory-Wafter, and I went and came as he would,<br/>And I chose the slain for his war-host, and the days were glorious and good,<br/>Till the thoughts of my heart overcame me, and the pride of my wisdom and speech,<br/>And I scorned the earth-folk's Framer and the Lord of the world I must teach:<br/>For the death-doomed I caught from the sword, and the fated life I slew,<br/>And I deemed that my deeds were goodly, and that long I should do and undo.<br/>But Allfather came against me and the God in his wrath arose;<br/>And he cried: `Thou hast thought in thy folly that the Gods have friends and foes,<br/>That they wake, and the world wends onward, that they sleep, and the world slips back,<br/>That they laugh, and the world's weal waxeth, that they frown and fashion the the wrack:<br/>Thou hast cast up the curse against me; it shall fall aback on thine head;<br/>Go back to the sons of repentance, with the children of sorrow wed!<br/>For the Gods are great unholpen, and their grief is seldom seen,<br/>And the wrong that they will and must be is soon as it had not been.'<br/><br/>"Yet I thought: `Shall I wed in the world,shall I gather grief on the earth?<br/>Then the fearless heart shall I wed, and bring the best to birth,<br/>And fashion such tales for the telling, that Earth shall be holpen at least,<br/>If the Gods think scorn of its fairness, as they sit at the changeless feast.'<br/>"Then somewhat smiled Allfather; and he spake: 'So let it be!<br/>The doom thereof abideth; the doom of me and thee.<br/>Yet long shall the time pass over ere thy waking day be born:<br/>Fare forth, and forget and be weary 'neath the Sting of the Sleepful Thorn!'<br/><br/>'So I came to the head of Hindfell and the ruddy shields and white,<br/>And the wall of the wildfire wavering around the isle of night;<br/>And there the Sleep-thorn pierced me, and the slumber on me fell,<br/>And the night of nameless sorrows that hath no tale to tell.<br/>Now I am she that loveth; and the day is nigh at hand<br/>When I, who have ridden the sea-realm and the regions of the land,<br/>And dwelt in the measureless mountains and the forge of stormy days,<br/>Shall dwell in the house of my fathers and the land of the people's praise;<br/>And there shall hand meet hand, and heart by heart shall beat,<br/>And the lying-down shall be joyous, and the morn's uprising sweet.<br/>Lo now, I look on thine heart and behold of thine inmost will,<br/>That thou of the days wouldst hearken that our portion shall fulfil;<br/>But O, be wise of man-folk, and the hope of thine heart refrain!<br/>As oft in the battle's beginning ye vex the steed with the rein,<br/>Lest at last in the latter ending, when the sword hath hushed the horn,<br/>His limbs should be weary and fail, and his might be over-worn.<br/>O be wise, lest thy love constrain me, and my vision wax o'er-clear,<br/>And thou ask of the thing that thou shouldst not, and the thing that thou wouldst not hear.<br/><br/>Know thou, most mighty of men, that the Norns shall order all,<br/>And yet without thine helping shall no whit of their will befall;<br/>Be wise! 'tis a marvel of words, and a mock for the fool and the blind;<br/>But I saw it writ in the heavens, and its fashioning there did I find:<br/>And the night of the Norns and their slumber, and the tide when the world runs back,<br/>And the way of the sun is tangled, it is wrought of the dastard's lack.<br/>But the day when the fair earth blossoms, and the sun is bright above,<br/>Of the daring deeds is it fashioned and the eager hearts of love.<br/><br/>"Be wise, and cherish thine hope in the freshness of the days,<br/>And scatter its seed from thine hand in the field of the people's praise;<br/>Then fair shall it fall in the furrow, and some the earth shall speed,<br/>And the sons of men shall marvel at the blossom of the deed:<br/>But some the earth shall speed not: nay rather, the wind of the heaven<br/>Shall waft it away from thy longing--and a gift to the Gods hast thou given,<br/>And a tree for the roof and the wall in the house of the hope that shall be,<br/>Though it seemeth our very sorrow, and the grief of thee and me.<br/><br/>"Strive not with the fools of man-folk: for belike thou shalt overcome;<br/>And what then is the gain of thine hunting when thou bearest the quarry home?<br/>Or else shall the fool overcome thee, and what deed thereof shall grow?<br/>Nay, strive with the wise man rather, and increase thy woe and his woe;<br/>Yet thereof a gain hast thou gotten; and the half of thine heart hast thou won<br/>If thou mayst prevail against him, and his deeds are the deeds thou hast done;<br/>Yea, and if thou fall before him, in him shalt thou live again,<br/>And thy deeds in his hand shall blossom, and his heart of thine heart shall be fain.<br/><br/>"When thou hearest the fool rejoicing, and he saith, 'It is over and past,<br/>And the wrong was better than right, and hate turns into love at the last,<br/>And we strove for nothing at all, and the Gods are fallen asleep;<br/>For so good is the world a-growing that the evil good shall reap:'<br/>Then loosen thy sword in the scabbard and settle the helm on thine head,<br/>For men betrayed are mighty, and great are the wrongfully dead.<br/><br/>"Wilt thou do the deed and repent it? thou hadst better never been born:<br/>Wilt thou do the deed and exalt it? then thy fame shall be outworn:<br/>Thou shalt do the deed and abide it, and sit on thy throne on high,<br/>And look on today and tomorrow as those that never die.<br/><br/>"Love thou the Gods--and withstand them, lest thy fame should fail in the end,<br/>And thou be but their thrall and their bondsman, who wert born for their very friend:<br/>For few things from the Gods are hidden, and the hearts of men they know,<br/>And how that none rejoiceth to quail and crouch alow.<br/><br/>"I have spoken the words, belov{`e}d, to thy matchless glory and worth;<br/>But thy heart to my heart hath been speaking, though my tongue hath set it forth:<br/>For I am she that loveth, and I know what thou wouldst teach<br/>From the heart of thine unlearned wisdom, and I needs must speak thy speech."<br/><br/>Then words were weary and silent, but oft and o'er again<br/>They craved and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain.<br/><br/>Then spake the Son of Sigmund: "Fairest, and most of worth,<br/>Hast thou seen the ways of man-folk and the regions of the earth?<br/>Then speak yet more of wisdom; for most meet meseems it is<br/>That my soul to thy soul be shapen, and that I should know thy bliss."<br/><br/>So she took his right hand meekly, nor any word would say,<br/>Not e'en of love or praising, his longing to delay;<br/>And they sat on the side of Hindfell, and their fain eyes looked and loved,<br/>As she told of the hidden matters whereby the world is moved:<br/>And she told of the framing of all things, and the houses of the heaven;<br/>And she told of the star-worlds' courses, and how the winds be driven;<br/>And she told of the Norns and their names, and the fate that abideth the earth;<br/>And she told of the ways of the King-folk in their anger and their mirth;<br/>And she spoke of the love of women, and told of the flame that burns,<br/>And the fall of mighty houses, and the friend that falters and turns,<br/>And the lurking blinded vengeance, and the wrong that amendeth wrong,<br/>And the hand that repenteth its stroke, and the grief that endureth for long:<br/>And how man shall bear and forbear, and be master of all that is;<br/>And how man shall measure it all, the wrath, and the grief, and the bliss.<br/>"I saw the body of Wisdom, and of shifting guise was she wrought,<br/>And I stretched out my hands to hold her, and a mote of the dust they caught;<br/>And I prayed her to come for my teaching, and she came in the midnight dream--<br/>And I woke and might not remember, nor betwixt her tangle deem:<br/>She spake, and how might I hearken; I heard, and how might I know;<br/>I knew, and how might I fashion, or her hidden glory show?<br/>All things I have told thee of Wisdom are but fleeting images<br/>Of her hosts that abide in the heavens, and her light that Allfather sees:<br/>Yet wise is the sower that sows, and wise is the reaper that reaps,<br/>And wise is the smith in his smiting, and wise is the warder that keeps:<br/>And wise shalt thou be to deliver, and I shall be wise to desire;<br/>--And lo, the tale that is told, and the sword and the wakening fire!<br/>Lo now, I am she that loveth, and hark how Greyfell neighs,<br/>And Fafnir's Bed is gleaming, and green go the downward ways,<br/>The road to the children of men and the deeds that thou shalt do<br/>In the joy of thy life-days' morning, when thine hope is fashioned anew.<br/>Come now, O Bane of the Serpent, for now is the high-noon come,<br/>And the sun hangeth over Hindfell and looks on the earth-folk's home;<br/>But the soul is so great within thee, and so glorious are thine eyes,<br/>And me so love constraineth, and mine heart that was called the wise,<br/>That we twain may see men's dwellings and the house where we shall dwell,<br/>And the place of our life's beginning, where the tale shall be to tell."<br/><br/>So they climb the burg of Hindfell, and hand in hand they fare,<br/>Till all about and above them is nought but the sunlit air,<br/>And there close they cling together rejoicing in their mirth;<br/>For far away beneath them lie the kingdoms of the earth,<br/>And the garths of men-folk's dwellings and the streams that water them,<br/>And the rich and plenteous acres, and the silver ocean's hem,<br/>And the woodland wastes and the mountains, and all that holdeth all;<br/>The house and the ship and the island, the loom and the mine and the stall,<br/>The beds of bane and healing, the crafts that slay and save,<br/>The temple of God and the Doom-ring, the cradle and the grave.<br/><br/>Then spake the Victory-Wafter: "O King of the Earthly Age,<br/>As a God thou beholdest the treasure and the joy of thine heritage,<br/>And where on the wings of his hope is the spirit of Sigurd borne?<br/>Yet I bid thee hover awhile as a lark alow on the corn;<br/>Yet I bid thee look on the land 'twixt the wood and the silver sea<br/>In the bight of the swirling river, and the house that cherished me!<br/>There dwelleth mine earthly sister and the king that she hath wed;<br/>There morn by morn aforetime I woke on the golden bed;<br/>There eve by eve I tarried mid the speech and the lays of kings;<br/>There noon by noon I wandered and plucked the blossoming things;<br/>The little land of Lymdale by the swirling river's side,<br/>Where Brynhild once was I called in the days ere my father died;<br/>The little land of Lymdale 'twixt the woodland and the sea,<br/>Where on thee mine eyes shall brighten and thine eyes shall beam on me."<br/>"I shall seek thee there," said Sigurd, "when the day-spring is begun,<br/>Ere we wend the world together in the season of the sun."<br/><br/>"I shall bide thee there," said Brynhild, "till the fulness of the days,<br/>And the time for the glory appointed, and the springing-tide of praise."<br/>From his hand then draweth Sigurd Andvari's ancient Gold;<br/>There is nought but the sky above them as the ring together they hold,<br/>The shapen ancient token, that hath no change nor end,<br/>No change, and no beginning, no flaw for God to mend:<br/>Then Sigurd cries: "O Brynhild, now hearken while I swear,<br/>That the sun shall die in the heavens and the day no more be fair,<br/>If I seek not love in Lymdale and the house that fostered thee,<br/>And the land where thou awakedst 'twixt the woodland and the sea!"<br/><br/>And she cried: "O Sigurd, Sigurd, now hearken while I swear<br/>That the day shall die for ever and the sun to blackness wear,<br/>Ere I forget thee, Sigurd, as I lie 'twixt wood and sea<br/>In the little land of Lymdale and the house that fostered me!"<br/><br/>Then he set the ring on her finger and once, if ne'er again,<br/>They kissed and clung together, and their hearts were full and fain.<br/><br/>So the day grew old about them and the joy of their desire,<br/>And eve and the sunset came, and faint grew the sunset fire,<br/>And the shadowless death of the day was sweet in the golden tide;<br/>But the stars shone forth on the world, and the twilight changed and died;<br/>And sure if the first of man-folk had been born to that starry night,<br/>And had heard no tale of the sunrise, he had never longed for the light:<br/>But Earth longed amidst her slumber, as 'neath the night she lay,<br/>And fresh and all abundant abode the deeds of Day.
