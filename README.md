# üíÆ From The Ladies Defence by *Lady Mary Chudleigh*

<p>
    Melissa: I've still rever'd your Order [she is responding to a Parson] as Divine;<br/>And when I see unblemish'd Virtue shine,<br/>When solid Learning, and substantial Sense,<br/>Are joyn'd with unaffected Eloquence;<br/>When Lives and Doctrices of a Piece are made,<br/>And holy Truths with humble Zeal convey'd;<br/>When free from Passion, Bigottry, and Pride,<br/>Not sway'd by Int'rest, nor to Parties ty'd,<br/>Contemning Riches, and abhorring strife,<br/>And shunning all the noisy Pomps of Life,<br/>You live the aweful Wonders of your time,<br/>Without the least Suspicion of a Crime:<br/>I shall with Joy the highest Deference pay,<br/>and heedfully attend to all you say.<br/>From such, Reproofs shall always welcome prove,<br/>As being th' Effects of Piety and Love.<br/>But those from me can challenge no Respect,<br/>Who on us all without just Cause reflect:<br/>Who without Mercy all the Sex decry,<br/>And into open Defamations fly:<br/>Who think us Creatures for Derision made,<br/>And the Creator with his Works upbraid:<br/>What he call'd good, they proudly think not so,<br/>And with their Malice, their Prophaneness show.<br/>'Tis hard we shou'd be by the Men despis'd,<br/>Yet kept from knowing what wou'd make us priz'd:<br/>Debarr'd from Knowledge, banish'd from the Schools,<br/>And with the utmost Industry bred Fools.<br/>Laugh'd out of Reason, jested out of Sense,<br/>And nothing left but Native Innocence:<br/>Then told we are incapable of Wit,<br/>And only for the meanest Drudgeries fit:<br/>Made Slaves to serve their Luxury and Pride,<br/>And with innumerable Hardships try'd,<br/>'Till Pitying Heav'n release us from our Pain,<br/>Kind Heav'n to whom alone we dare complain.<br/>Th' ill-natur'd World will no Compassion show;<br/>Such as are wretched, it wou'd still have so:<br/>It gratifies its Envy and its Spight;<br/>The most in others Miseries take Delight.<br/>While we are present they some Pity spare,<br/>And feast us on a thin Repast of Air:<br/>Look Grave and Sigh, when we our Wrongs relate,<br/>An in a Compliment accuse our Fate:<br/>Blame those to whom we our Misfortunes owe,<br/>And all the Signs of real Friendship show.<br/>But when we're absent, we their Sport are made,<br/>They fan the Flame, and our Oppressors aid;<br/>Joyn with the Stronger, the Victorious Side,<br/>And all our Suff'ring, all our griefs deride.<br/>Those gen'rous few, whom kinder Thoughts inspire,<br/>And who the Happiness of all desire;<br/>Who wish we were from barb'rous Usage free,<br/>Exempt from Toils, and shameful Slavery,<br/>Yet let us, unreprov'd, mis. spend our Hours,<br/>And to mean Purposes employ our nobler Pow'rs.<br/>They think, if we our Thoughts can but express,<br/>And know but how to Work, to Dance and Dress,<br/>It is enough, as much as we shou'd mind,<br/>As if we were for nothing else design'd,<br/>But made, like Puppets, to divert Mankind.<br/>O that my Sex wou'd all such Toys despise;<br/>And only study to be Good, and Wise;<br/>Inspect themselves, and every Blemish find,<br/>Search all the close Recesses of the Mind,<br/>And leave no vice, no ruling Passion there,<br/>Nothing to raise a Blush, or cause a Fear:<br/>Their Memories with solid Notions fill,<br/>And let their Reason dictate to their Will,<br/>Instead of Novels, Histories peruse,<br/>And for their Guides the wiser Ancients chuse,<br/>Thro' all the Labyrinths of Learning go,<br/>And grow more humble, as they more do know.<br/>By doing this, they will Respect procure,<br/>Silence the Men, and lasting Fame secure;<br/>And to themselves the best Companions prove,<br/>And neither fear their Malice, nor desire their Love.
