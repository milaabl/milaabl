# üíÆ The Devil's Drive by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    THE Devil returned to Hell by two,<br/>  And he stayed at home till five;<br/>When he dined on some homicides done in _rago√ªt_,<br/>  And a rebel or so in an _Irish_ stew,<br/>And sausages made of a self-slain Jew,<br/>And bethought himself what next to do,<br/>  "And," quoth he, "I'll take a drive.<br/>I walked in the morning, I'll ride to-night;<br/>In darkness my children take most delight,<br/>  And I'll see how my favourites thrive.<br/><br/>"And what shall I ride in?" quoth Lucifer, then--<br/>  "If I followed my taste, indeed,<br/>I should mount in a waggon of wounded men,<br/>  And smile to see them bleed.<br/>But these will be furnished again and again,<br/>  And at present my purpose is speed;<br/>To see my manor as much as I may,<br/>And watch that no souls shall be poached away.<br/><br/>"I have a state-coach at Carlton House,<br/>  A chariot in Seymour-place;<br/>But they're lent to two friends, who make me amends<br/>  By driving my favourite pace:<br/>And they handle their reins with such a grace,<br/>I have something for both at the end of the race.<br/><br/>"So now for the earth to take my chance,"<br/>  Then up to the earth sprung he;<br/>And making a jump from Moscow to France,<br/>  He stepped across the sea,<br/>And rested his hoof on a turnpike road,<br/>No very great way from a Bishop's abode.<br/><br/>But first as he flew, I forgot to say,<br/>That he hovered a moment upon his way,<br/>  To look upon Leipsic plain;<br/>And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare,<br/>And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair,<br/>  That he perched on a mountain of slain;<br/>And he gazed with delight from its growing height,<br/>Nor often on earth had he seen such a sight,<br/>  Nor his work done half as well:<br/>For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,<br/>  That it blushed like the waves of Hell!<br/>Then loudly, and wildly, and long laughed he:<br/>"Methinks they have little need here of _me_!"<br/><br/>Long he looked down on the hosts of each clime,<br/>  While the warriors hand to hand were--<br/>Gaul--Austrian and Muscovite heroes sublime,<br/>And--(Muse of Fitzgerald arise with a rhyme!)<br/>  A quantity of _Landwehr_!<br/>      Gladness was there,<br/>For the men of all might and the monarchs of earth,<br/>There met for the wolf and the worm to make mirth,<br/>  And a feast for the fowls of the Air!<br/><br/>But he turned aside and looked from the ridge<br/>  Of hills along the river,<br/>And the best thing he saw was a broken bridge,<br/>  Which a Corporal chose to shiver;<br/>Though an Emperor's taste was displeased with his haste,<br/>  The Devil he thought it clever;<br/>And he laughed again in a lighter strain,<br/>  O'er the torrent swoln and rainy,<br/>When he saw "on a fiery steed" Prince Pon,<br/>In taking care of Number _One_--<br/>Get drowned with a great _many_!<br/><br/>But the softest note that soothed his ear<br/>  Was the sound of a widow sighing;<br/>And the sweetest sight was the icy tear,<br/>Which Horror froze in the blue eye clear<br/>  Of a maid by her lover lying--<br/>As round her fell her long fair hair,<br/>And she looked to Heaven with that frenzied air<br/>Which seemed to ask if a God were there!<br/>And stretched by the wall of a ruined hut,<br/>With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut,<br/>  A child of Famine dying:<br/>And the carnage _begun_, when _resistance_ is done,<br/>  And the fall of the vainly flying!<br/><br/>Then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken,<br/>  Nor cared he who were winning;<br/>But he saw an old maid, for years forsaken,<br/>  Get up and leave her spinning;<br/>And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass,<br/>She said--"pray are the rapes beginning?"<br/><br/>But the Devil has reached our cliffs so white,<br/>  And what did he there, I pray?<br/>If his eyes were good, he but saw by night<br/>  What we see every day;<br/>But he made a tour and kept a journal<br/>Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal,<br/>And he sold it in shares to the _Men_ of the _Row_,<br/>Who bid pretty well--but they _cheated_ him, though!<br/><br/>The Devil first saw, as he thought, the _Mail_,<br/>  Its coachman and his coat;<br/>So instead of a pistol he cocked his tail,<br/>  And seized him by the throat;<br/>"Aha!" quoth he, "what have we here?<br/>'T is a new barouche, and an ancient peer!"<br/><br/>So he sat him on his box again,<br/>  And bade him have no fear,<br/>But be true to his club, and staunch to his rein,<br/>  His brothel and his beer;<br/>"Next to seeing a Lord at the Council board,<br/>I would rather see him here."<br/><br/>Satan hired a horse and gig<br/>  With promises to pay;<br/>And he pawned his horns for a spruce new wig,<br/>  To redeem as he came away:<br/>And he whistled some tune, a waltz or a jig,<br/>  And drove off at the close of day.<br/><br/>The first place he stopped at--he heard the Psalm<br/>  That rung from a Methodist Chapel:<br/>"'T is the best sound I've heard," quoth he, "since my palm<br/>  Presented Eve her apple!<br/>When _Faith_ is all, 't is an excellent sign,<br/>That the _Works_ and Workmen both are mine."<br/><br/>He passed Tommy Tyrwhitt, that standing jest,<br/>  To princely wit a Martyr:<br/>But the last joke of all was by far the best,<br/>  When he sailed away with "the Garter"!<br/>"And"--quoth Satan--"this Embassy's worthy my sight,<br/>Should I see nothing else to amuse me to night.<br/>With no one to bear it, but Thomas √† Tyrwhitt,<br/>This ribband belongs to an 'Order of Merit'!"<br/><br/>He stopped at an Inn and stepped within<br/>  The Bar and read the "Times;"<br/>And never such a treat, as--the epistle of one "Vetus,"<br/>  Had he found save in downright crimes:<br/>"Though I doubt if this drivelling encomiast of War<br/>Ever saw a field fought, or felt a scar,<br/>Yet his fame shall go farther than he can guess,<br/>For I'll keep him a place in my _hottest Press_;<br/>And his works shall be bound in Morocco _d'Enfer_,<br/>And lettered behind with his _Nom de Guerre_."<br/><br/>The Devil gat next to Westminster,<br/>  And he turned to "the room" of the Commons;<br/>But he heard as he purposed to enter in there,<br/>  That "the Lords" had received a summons;<br/>And he thought, as "a _quondam_ Aristocrat,"<br/>He might peep at the Peers, though to _hear_ them were flat;<br/>And he walked up the House so like one of his own,<br/>That they say that he stood pretty near the throne.<br/><br/>He saw the Lord Liverpool seemingly wise,<br/>  The Lord Westmoreland certainly silly,<br/>And Jockey of Norfolk--a man of some size--<br/>  And Chatham, so like his friend Billy;<br/>And he saw the tears in Lord Eldon's eyes,<br/>  Because the Catholics would _not_ rise,<br/>  In spite of his prayers and his prophecies;<br/>And he heard--which set Satan himself a staring--<br/>A certain Chief Justice say something like _swearing_.<br/>And the Devil was shocked--and quoth he, "I must go,<br/>For I find we have much better manners below.<br/>If thus he harangues when he passes my border,<br/>I shall hint to friend Moloch to call him to order."<br/><br/>Then the Devil went down to the humbler House,<br/>  Where he readily found his way<br/>As natural to him as its hole to a Mouse,<br/>  He had been there many a day;<br/>And many a vote and soul and job he<br/>  Had bid for and carried away from the Lobby:<br/>But there now was a "call" and accomplished debaters<br/>Appeared in the glory of hats, boots and gaiters--<br/>_Some_ paid rather more--but _all_ worse dressed<br/>      than Waiters!<br/><br/>There was Canning for War, and Whitbread for peace,<br/>  And others as suited their fancies;<br/>But all were agreed that our debts should increase<br/>  Excepting the Demagogue Francis.<br/>That rogue! how could Westminster chuse him again<br/>  To leaven the virtue of these honest men!<br/>But the Devil remained till the Break of Day<br/>  Blushed upon Sleep and Lord Castlereagh:<br/>Then up half the house got, and Satan got up<br/>  With the drowsy to snore--or the hungry to sup:--<br/>But so torpid the power of some speakers, 't is said,<br/>That they sent even him to his brimstone bed.<br/><br/>He had seen George Rose--but George was grown dumb,<br/>   And only lied in thought!<br/>And the Devil has all the pleasure to come<br/>  Of hearing him talk as he ought.<br/>With the falsest of tongues, the sincerest of men--<br/>  His veracity were but deceit--<br/>And Nature must first have unmade him again,<br/>Ere his breast or his face, or his tongue, or his pen,<br/>Conceived--uttered--looked--or wrote down letters ten,<br/>Which Truth would acknowledge complete.<br/><br/>Satan next took the army list in hand,<br/>  Where he found a new "Field Marshal;"<br/>And when he saw this high command<br/>  Conferred on his Highness of Cumberland,<br/>"Oh! were I prone to cavil--or were I not the Devil,<br/>  I should say this was somewhat partial;<br/>Since the only wounds that this Warrior gat,<br/>Were from God knows whom--and the Devil knows what!"<br/><br/>He then popped his head in a royal Ball,<br/>  And saw all the Haram so hoary;<br/>And who there besides but Corinna de Sta√´l!<br/>  Turned Methodist and Tory!<br/>"Aye--Aye"--quoth he--"'t is the way with them all,<br/>  When Wits grow tired of Glory:<br/>But thanks to the weakness, that thus could pervert her,<br/>Since the dearest of prizes to me's a deserter:<br/>_Mem_--whenever a sudden conversion I want,<br/>To send to the school of Philosopher Kant;<br/>And whenever I need a critic who can gloss over<br/>All faults--to send for Mackintosh to write up the Philosopher."<br/><br/>The Devil waxed faint at the sight of this Saint,<br/>  And he thought himself of eating;<br/>And began to cram from a plate of ham<br/>  Wherewith a Page was retreating--<br/>Having nothing else to do (for "the friends" each so near<br/>  Had sold all their souls long before),<br/>As he swallowed down the bacon he wished himself a Jew<br/>  For the sake of another crime more:<br/>For Sinning itself is but half a recreation,<br/>Unless it ensures most infallible Damnation.<br/><br/>But he turned him about, for he heard a sound<br/>  Which even his ear found faults in;<br/>For whirling above--underneath--and around--<br/>  Were his fairest Disciples Waltzing!<br/>And quoth he--"though this be--the _premier pas_ to me,<br/>  Against it I would warn all--<br/>Should I introduce these revels among my younger devils,<br/>  They would all turn perfectly carnal:<br/>And though fond of the flesh--yet I never could bear it<br/>Should quite in my kingdom get the upper hand of Spirit."<br/><br/>The Devil (but 't was over) had been vastly glad<br/>  To see the new Drury Lane,<br/>And yet he might have been rather mad<br/>  To see it rebuilt in vain;<br/>And had he beheld their "Nourjahad,"<br/>  Would never have gone again:<br/>And Satan had taken it much amiss,<br/>They should fasten such a piece on a friend of his--<br/>Though he knew that his works were somewhat sad,<br/>He never had found them _quite_ so bad:<br/>For this was "the book" which, of yore, Job, sorely smitten,<br/>Said, "Oh that _mine_ enemy, _mine_ enemy had written"!<br/><br/>Then he found sixty scribblers in separate cells,<br/>  And marvelled what they were doing,<br/>For they looked like little fiends in their own little hells,<br/>  Damnation for others brewing--<br/>Though their paper seemed to shrink, from the heat of their ink,<br/>  They were only _coolly_ reviewing!<br/>And as one of them wrote down the pronoun "_We_,"<br/>  "That Plural"--says Satan--"means _him_ and _me_,<br/>With the Editor added to make up the three<br/>Of an Athanasian Trinity,<br/>And render the believers in our 'Articles' sensible,<br/>How many must combine to form _one_ Incomprehensible"!
