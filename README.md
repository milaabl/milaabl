# üíÆ Beautiful Crief by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    Ye lovers of the picturesque, if ye wish to drown your grief,<br/>Take my advice, and visit the ancient town of Crieff;<br/>The climate is bracing, and the walks lovely to see.<br/>Besides, ye can ramble over the district, and view the beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>The town is admirably situated from the cold winter winds,<br/>And the visitors, during their stay there, great comfort finds,<br/>Because there is boating and fishing, and admission free,<br/>Therefore they can enjoy themselves right merrily.<br/><br/>There is also golf courses, tennis greens, and good roads,<br/>Which will make the travelling easier to tourists with great loads,<br/>And which will make the bicyclists' hearts feel gay,<br/>Because they have everything there to make an enjoyable holiday.<br/><br/>The principal river there is the Earn, rolling on its way,<br/>And which flows from Loch Earn, and joins the silvery Tay<br/>Above Newburgh, after a course of more than thirty miles;<br/>And as the tourist views the scene with joy he smiles.<br/><br/>The princely domain of Drummond Castle is most beautiful to be seen,<br/>Especially when the woody landscape is blown full green,<br/>And from the entrance gate to the castle an avenue extends all the way,<br/>And to view the branches of the frees interlacing makes the heart feel gay.<br/><br/>Drummond Castle's flowery gardens are really very grand;<br/>They cannot be surpassed in Great Britain,<br/>And in the summer-time the bee and the butterfly are there on the wing,<br/>And with the carolling of birds the gardens doth ring.<br/><br/>And from Knock Hill on the north and west,<br/>The view from its summit is considered the best;<br/>Because the Grampians and the Ochils can be seen,<br/>While the beautiful rich fertile valley lies between.<br/><br/>And there are many seats where the weary traveller can rest,<br/>And there is also a fountain of water, the very best,<br/>While visitors can drink of while resting there,<br/>And gaze on the magnificent scenery and inhale the pure air.<br/><br/>Then there's Lady Mary's Walk near the Bridge of Turret,<br/>Which I hope visitors will go and see and not forget,<br/>Because near by grows a magnificent oak most lovely to see,<br/>Which is known by the name of Eppie Callum's Tree.<br/><br/>And at each end of this walk the visitors can ascend Laggan Hill,<br/>And as they view the woods and fields with joy their hearts<br/>And they will find seats plenteous on this elevated bower,<br/>On which they may rest and wile away the hour.<br/><br/>The Hydropathic is situated on an eminence most grand,<br/>And is one of the largest buildings in fair Scotland;<br/>And capable of accommodating five hundred visitors, who often call there,<br/>To recuperate their health and breathe the fragrant air.<br/><br/>Then there's Abercairny, which is most beautiful to view,<br/>And Her Majesty the Queen visited the grounds in 1842;<br/>And the park and the trees has the aspect of a southern scene,<br/>And the lovely appearance of it gladdened the heart of our Queen.<br/><br/>Then there's the village of Foulis, which tourists ought to see,<br/>Because the scenery there is charming and pretty;<br/>And there's a sycamore tree there that was planted 300 years ago,<br/>And I'm sure the sight thereof will please both high and low.<br/><br/>Therefore, in conclusion, to all lovers of the beautiful I will say,<br/>If ye really wish to spend an enjoyable holiday,<br/>I would recommend Crieff for lovely scenery and pure air;<br/>Besides, the climate gives health to many visitors during their stay there.
</p>
