  <summary>📚 <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> 👇 </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# 💮 A Dialogue by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    DEATH:<br/>For my dagger is bathed in the blood of the brave,<br/>I come, care-worn tenant of life, from the grave,<br/>Where Innocence sleeps 'neath the peace-giving sod,<br/>And the good cease to tremble at Tyranny's nod;<br/>I offer a calm habitation to thee,--<br/>Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?<br/>My mansion is damp, cold silence is there,<br/>But it lulls in oblivion the fiends of despair;<br/>Not a groan of regret, not a sigh, not a breath,<br/>Dares dispute with grim Silence the empire of Death.<br/>I offer a calm habitation to thee,--<br/>Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?<br/><br/>MORTAL:<br/>Mine eyelids are heavy; my soul seeks repose,<br/>It longs in thy cells to embosom its woes,<br/>It longs in thy cells to deposit its load,<br/>Where no longer the scorpions of Perfidy goad,--<br/>Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away,<br/>And Bigotry's bloodhounds lose scent of their prey.<br/>Yet tell me, dark Death, when thine empire is o'er,<br/>What awaits on Futurity's mist-covered shore?<br/><br/>DEATH:<br/>Cease, cease, wayward Mortal! I dare not unveil<br/>The shadows that float o'er Eternity's vale;<br/>Nought waits for the good but a spirit of Love,<br/>That will hail their blest advent to regions above.<br/>For Love, Mortal, gleams through the gloom of my sway,<br/>And the shades which surround me fly fast at its ray.<br/>Hast thou loved?--Then depart from these regions of hate,<br/>And in slumber with me blunt the arrows of fate.<br/>I offer a calm habitation to thee.--<br/>Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?<br/><br/>MORTAL:<br/>Oh! sweet is thy slumber! oh! sweet is the ray<br/>Which after thy night introduces the day;<br/>How concealed, how persuasive, self-interest's breath,<br/>Though it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death!<br/>I hoped that I quite was forgotten by all,<br/>Yet a lingering friend might be grieved at my fall,<br/>And duty forbids, though I languish to die,<br/>When departure might heave Virtue's breast with a sigh.<br/>O Death! O my friend! snatch this form to thy shrine,<br/>And I fear, dear destroyer, I shall not repine.
</p>
