# 💮 THE ARSENAL AT SPRINGFIELD by *Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*

<p>
    This is the Arsenal.  From floor to ceiling,<br/>Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms;<br/>But front their silent pipes no anthem pealing<br/>Startles the villages with strange alarms.<br/><br/>Ah! what a sound will rise, how wild and dreary,<br/>When the death-angel touches those swift keys<br/>What loud lament and dismal Miserere<br/>Will mingle with their awful symphonies<br/><br/>I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus,<br/>The cries of agony, the endless groan,<br/>Which, through the ages that have gone before us,<br/>In long reverberations reach our own.<br/><br/>On helm and harness rings the Saxon hammer,<br/>Through Cimbric forest roars the Norseman's song,<br/>And loud, amid the universal clamor,<br/>O'er distant deserts sounds the Tartar gong.<br/><br/>I hear the Florentine, who from his palace<br/>Wheels out his battle-bell with dreadful din,<br/>And Aztec priests upon their teocallis<br/>Beat the wild war-drums made of serpent's skin;<br/><br/>The tumult of each sacked and burning village;<br/>The shout that every prayer for mercy drowns;<br/>The soldiers' revels in the midst of pillage;<br/>The wail of famine in beleaguered towns;<br/><br/>The bursting shell, the gateway wrenched asunder,<br/>The rattling musketry, the clashing blade;<br/>And ever and anon, in tones of thunder,<br/>The diapason of the cannonade.<br/><br/>Is it, O man, with such discordant noises,<br/>With such accursed instruments as these,<br/>Thou drownest Nature's sweet and kindly voices,<br/>And jarrest the celestial harmonies?<br/><br/>Were half the power, that fills the world with terror,<br/>Were half the wealth, bestowed on camps and courts,<br/>Given to redeem the human mind from error,<br/>There were no need of arsenals or forts:<br/><br/>The warrior's name would be a name abhorred!<br/>And every nation, that should lift again<br/>Its hand against a brother, on its forehead<br/>Would wear forevermore the curse of Cain!<br/><br/>Down the dark future, through long generations,<br/>The echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease;<br/>And like a bell, with solemn, sweet vibrations,<br/>I hear once more the voice of Christ say, "Peace!"<br/><br/>Peace! and no longer from its brazen portals<br/>The blast of War's great organ shakes the skies!<br/>But beautiful as songs of the immortals,<br/>The holy melodies of love arise.
