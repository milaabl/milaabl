  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ A Calendar of Sonnets: April by *Helen Hunt Jackson*

<p>
    No days such honored days as these! While yet<br/>Fair Aphrodite reigned, men seeking wide<br/>For some fair thing which should forever bide<br/>On earth, her beauteous memory to set<br/>In fitting frame that no age could forget,<br/>Her name in lovely April's name did hide,<br/>And leave it there, eternally allied<br/>To all the fairest flowers Spring did beget.<br/>And when fair Aphrodite passed from earth,<br/>Her shrines forgotten and her feasts of mirth,<br/>A holier symbol still in seal and sign,<br/>Sweet April took, of kingdom most divine,<br/>When Christ ascended, in the time of birth<br/>Of spring anemones, in Palestine.
</p>
