# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Merchant's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>"Weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow,<br/>I have enough, on even and on morrow,"<br/>Quoth the Merchant, "and so have other mo',<br/>That wedded be; I trow that it be so;<br/>For well I wot it fareth so by me.<br/>I have a wife, the worste that may be,<br/>For though the fiend to her y-coupled were,<br/>She would him overmatch, I dare well swear.<br/>Why should I you rehearse in special<br/>Her high malice? she is a shrew at all.<br/>There is a long and large difference<br/>Betwixt Griselda's greate patience,<br/>And of my wife the passing cruelty.<br/>Were I unbounden, all so may I the,<br/>I woulde never eft come in the snare.<br/>We wedded men live in sorrow and care;<br/>Assay it whoso will, and he shall find<br/>That I say sooth, by Saint Thomas of Ind,<br/>As for the more part; I say not all, --<br/>God shielde that it shoulde so befall.<br/>Ah! good Sir Host, I have y-wedded be<br/>These moneths two, and more not, pardie;<br/>And yet I trow that he that all his life<br/>Wifeless hath been, though that men would him rive<br/>Into the hearte, could in no mannere<br/>Telle so much sorrow, as I you here<br/>Could tellen of my wife's cursedness."<br/><br/>"Now," quoth our Host, "Merchant, so God you bless,<br/>Since ye so muche knowen of that art,<br/>Full heartily I pray you tell us part."<br/>"Gladly," quoth he; "but of mine owen sore,<br/>For sorry heart, I telle may no more."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>Whilom there was dwelling in Lombardy<br/>A worthy knight, that born was at Pavie,<br/>In which he liv'd in great prosperity;<br/>And forty years a wifeless man was he,<br/>And follow'd aye his bodily delight<br/>On women, where as was his appetite,<br/>As do these fooles that be seculeres.<br/>And, when that he was passed sixty years,<br/>Were it for holiness, or for dotage,<br/>I cannot say, but such a great corage<br/>Hadde this knight to be a wedded man,<br/>That day and night he did all that he can<br/>To espy where that he might wedded be;<br/>Praying our Lord to grante him, that he<br/>Mighte once knowen of that blissful life<br/>That is betwixt a husband and his wife,<br/>And for to live under that holy bond<br/>With which God firste man and woman bond.<br/>"None other life," said he, "is worth a bean;<br/>For wedlock is so easy, and so clean,<br/>That in this world it is a paradise."<br/>Thus said this olde knight, that was so wise.<br/>And certainly, as sooth as God is king,<br/>To take a wife it is a glorious thing,<br/>And namely when a man is old and hoar,<br/>Then is a wife the fruit of his treasor;<br/>Then should he take a young wife and a fair,<br/>On which he might engender him an heir,<br/>And lead his life in joy and in solace;<br/>Whereas these bachelors singen "Alas!"<br/>When that they find any adversity<br/>In love, which is but childish vanity.<br/>And truely it sits well to be so,<br/>That bachelors have often pain and woe:<br/>On brittle ground they build, and brittleness<br/>They finde when they weene sickerness:<br/>They live but as a bird or as a beast,<br/>In liberty, and under no arrest;<br/>Whereas a wedded man in his estate<br/>Liveth a life blissful and ordinate,<br/>Under the yoke of marriage y-bound;<br/>Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound.<br/>For who can be so buxom as a wife?<br/>Who is so true, and eke so attentive<br/>To keep him, sick and whole, as is his make?<br/>For weal or woe she will him not forsake:<br/>She is not weary him to love and serve,<br/>Though that he lie bedrid until he sterve.<br/>And yet some clerkes say it is not so;<br/>Of which he, Theophrast, is one of tho:<br/>What force though Theophrast list for to lie?<br/><br/>"Take no wife," quoth he,  "for husbandry,<br/>As for to spare in household thy dispence;<br/>A true servant doth more diligence<br/>Thy good to keep, than doth thine owen wife,<br/>For she will claim a half part all her life.<br/>And if that thou be sick, so God me save,<br/>Thy very friendes, or a true knave,<br/>Will keep thee bet than she, that waiteth aye<br/>After thy good, and hath done many a day."<br/>This sentence, and a hundred times worse,<br/>Writeth this man, there God his bones curse.<br/>But take no keep of all such vanity,<br/>Defy Theophrast, and hearken to me.<br/><br/>A wife is Godde's gifte verily;<br/>All other manner giftes hardily,<br/>As handes, rentes, pasture, or commune,<br/>Or mebles, all be giftes of fortune,<br/>That passen as a shadow on the wall:<br/>But dread thou not, if plainly speak I shall,<br/>A wife will last, and in thine house endure,<br/>Well longer than thee list, paraventure.<br/>Marriage is a full great sacrament;<br/>He which that hath no wife, I hold him shent;<br/>He liveth helpless, and all desolate<br/>(I speak of folk in secular estate):<br/>And hearken why, I say not this for nought, --<br/>That woman is for manne's help y-wrought.<br/>The highe God, when he had Adam maked,<br/>And saw him all alone belly naked,<br/>God of his greate goodness saide then,<br/>Let us now make a help unto this man<br/>Like to himself; and then he made him Eve.<br/>Here may ye see, and hereby may ye preve,<br/>That a wife is man s help and his comfort,<br/>His paradise terrestre and his disport.<br/>So buxom and so virtuous is she,<br/>They muste needes live in unity;<br/>One flesh they be, and one blood, as I guess,<br/>With but one heart in weal and in distress.<br/>A wife? Ah! Saint Mary, ben'dicite,<br/>How might a man have any adversity<br/>That hath a wife? certes I cannot say<br/>The bliss the which that is betwixt them tway,<br/>There may no tongue it tell, or hearte think.<br/>If he be poor, she helpeth him to swink;<br/>She keeps his good, and wasteth never a deal;<br/>All that her husband list, her liketh well;<br/>She saith not ones Nay, when he saith Yea;<br/>"Do this," saith he; "All ready, Sir," saith she.<br/>O blissful order, wedlock precious!<br/>Thou art so merry, and eke so virtuous,<br/>And so commended and approved eke,<br/>That every man that holds him worth a leek<br/>Upon his bare knees ought all his life<br/>To thank his God, that him hath sent a wife;<br/>Or elles pray to God him for to send<br/>A wife, to last unto his life's end.<br/>For then his life is set in sickerness,<br/>He may not be deceived, as I guess,<br/>So that he work after his wife's rede;<br/>Then may he boldely bear up his head,<br/>They be so true, and therewithal so wise.<br/>For which, if thou wilt worken as the wise,<br/>Do alway so as women will thee rede.<br/>Lo how that Jacob, as these clerkes read,<br/>By good counsel of his mother Rebecc'<br/>Bounde the kiddes skin about his neck;<br/>For which his father's benison he wan.<br/>Lo Judith, as the story telle can,<br/>By good counsel she Godde's people kept,<br/>And slew him, Holofernes, while he slept.<br/>Lo Abigail, by good counsel, how she<br/>Saved her husband Nabal, when that he<br/>Should have been slain.  And lo, Esther also<br/>By counsel good deliver'd out of woe<br/>The people of God, and made him, Mardoche,<br/>Of Assuere enhanced for to be.<br/>There is nothing in gree superlative<br/>(As saith Senec) above a humble wife.<br/>Suffer thy wife's tongue, as Cato bit;<br/>She shall command, and thou shalt suffer it,<br/>And yet she will obey of courtesy.<br/>A wife is keeper of thine husbandry:<br/>Well may the sicke man bewail and weep,<br/>There as there is no wife the house to keep.<br/>I warne thee, if wisely thou wilt wirch,<br/>Love well thy wife, as Christ loveth his church:<br/>Thou lov'st thyself, if thou lovest thy wife.<br/>No man hateth his flesh, but in his life<br/>He fost'reth it; and therefore bid I thee<br/>Cherish thy wife, or thou shalt never the.<br/>Husband and wife, what so men jape or play,<br/>Of worldly folk holde the sicker way;<br/>They be so knit there may no harm betide,<br/>And namely upon the wife's side.<br/><br/>For which this January, of whom I told,<br/>Consider'd hath within his dayes old,<br/>The lusty life, the virtuous quiet,<br/>That is in marriage honey-sweet.<br/>And for his friends upon a day he sent<br/>To tell them the effect  of his intent.<br/>With face sad, his tale he hath them told:<br/>He saide, "Friendes, I am hoar and old,<br/>And almost (God wot) on my pitte's brink,<br/>Upon my soule somewhat must I think.<br/>I have my body foolishly dispended,<br/>Blessed be God that it shall be amended;<br/>For I will be certain a wedded man,<br/>And that anon in all the haste I can,<br/>Unto some maiden, fair and tender of age;<br/>I pray you shape for my marriage<br/>All suddenly, for I will not abide:<br/>And I will fond to espy, on my side,<br/>To whom I may be wedded hastily.<br/>But forasmuch as ye be more than,<br/>Ye shalle rather such a thing espy<br/>Than I, and where me best were to ally.<br/>But one thing warn I you, my friendes dear,<br/>I will none old wife have in no mannere:<br/>She shall not passe sixteen year certain.<br/>Old fish and younge flesh would I have fain.<br/>Better," quoth he, "a pike than a pickerel,<br/>And better than old beef is tender veal.<br/>I will no woman thirty year of age,<br/>It is but beanestraw and great forage.<br/>And eke these olde widows (God it wot)<br/>They conne so much craft on Wade's boat,<br/>So muche brooke harm when that them lest,<br/>That with them should I never live in rest.<br/>For sundry schooles make subtle clerkes;<br/>Woman of many schooles half a clerk is.<br/>But certainly a young thing men may guy,<br/>Right as men may warm wax with handes ply.<br/>Wherefore I say you plainly in a clause,<br/>I will none old wife have, right for this cause.<br/>For if so were I hadde such mischance,<br/>That I in her could have no pleasance,<br/>Then should I lead my life in avoutrie,<br/>And go straight to the devil when I die.<br/>Nor children should I none upon her getten:<br/>Yet were me lever houndes had me eaten<br/>Than that mine heritage shoulde fall<br/>In strange hands: and this I tell you all.<br/>I doubte not I know the cause why<br/>Men shoulde wed: and farthermore know I<br/>There speaketh many a man of marriage<br/>That knows no more of it than doth my page,<br/>For what causes a man should take a wife.<br/>If he ne may not live chaste his life,<br/>Take him a wife with great devotion,<br/>Because of lawful procreation<br/>Of children, to th' honour of God above,<br/>And not only for paramour or love;<br/>And for they shoulde lechery eschew,<br/>And yield their debte when that it is due:<br/>Or for that each of them should help the other<br/>In mischief, as a sister shall the brother,<br/>And live in chastity full holily.<br/>But, Sires, by your leave, that am not I,<br/>For, God be thanked, I dare make avaunt,<br/>I feel my limbes stark and suffisant<br/>To do all that a man belongeth to:<br/>I wot myselfe best what I may do.<br/>Though I be hoar, I fare as doth a tree,<br/>That blossoms ere the fruit y-waxen be;<br/>The blossomy tree is neither dry nor dead;<br/>I feel me now here hoar but on my head.<br/>Mine heart and all my limbes are as green<br/>As laurel through the year is for to seen.<br/>And, since that ye have heard all mine intent,<br/>I pray you to my will ye would assent."<br/><br/>Diverse men diversely him told<br/>Of marriage many examples old;<br/>Some blamed it, some praised it, certain;<br/>But at the haste, shortly for to sayn<br/>(As all day falleth altercation<br/>Betwixte friends in disputation),<br/>There fell a strife betwixt his brethren two,<br/>Of which that one was called Placebo,<br/>Justinus soothly called was that other.<br/><br/>Placebo said; "O January, brother,<br/>Full little need have ye, my lord so dear,<br/>Counsel to ask of any that is here:<br/>But that ye be so full of sapience,<br/>That you not liketh, for your high prudence,<br/>To waive from the word of Solomon.<br/>This word said he unto us every one;<br/>Work alle thing by counsel, -- thus said he, --<br/>And thenne shalt thou not repente thee<br/>But though that Solomon spake such a word,<br/>Mine owen deare brother and my lord,<br/>So wisly God my soule bring at rest,<br/>I hold your owen counsel is the best.<br/>For, brother mine, take of me this motive;<br/>I have now been a court-man all my life,<br/>And, God it wot, though I unworthy be,<br/>I have standen in full great degree<br/>Aboute lordes of full high estate;<br/>Yet had I ne'er with none of them debate;<br/>I never them contraried truely.<br/>I know well that my lord can more than I;<br/>What that he saith I hold it firm and stable,<br/>I say the same, or else a thing semblable.<br/>A full great fool is any counsellor<br/>That serveth any lord of high honour<br/>That dare presume, or ones thinken it;<br/>That his counsel should pass his lorde's wit.<br/>Nay, lordes be no fooles by my fay.<br/>Ye have yourselfe shewed here to day<br/>So high sentence, so holily and well<br/>That I consent, and confirm every deal<br/>Your wordes all, and your opinioun<br/>By God, there is no man in all this town<br/>Nor in Itale, could better have y-said.<br/>Christ holds him of this counsel well apaid.<br/>And truely it is a high courage<br/>Of any man that stopen is in age,<br/>To take a young wife, by my father's kin;<br/>Your hearte hangeth on a jolly pin.<br/>Do now in this matter right as you lest,<br/>For finally I hold it for the best."<br/><br/>Justinus, that aye stille sat and heard,<br/>Right in this wise to Placebo answer'd.<br/>"Now, brother mine, be patient I pray,<br/>Since ye have said, and hearken what I say.<br/>Senec, among his other wordes wise,<br/>Saith, that a man ought him right well advise,<br/>To whom he gives his hand or his chattel.<br/>And since I ought advise me right well<br/>To whom I give my good away from me,<br/>Well more I ought advise me, pardie,<br/>To whom I give my body: for alway<br/>I warn you well it is no childe's play<br/>To take a wife without advisement.<br/>Men must inquire (this is mine assent)<br/>Whe'er she be wise, or sober, or dronkelew,<br/>Or proud, or any other ways a shrew,<br/>A chidester, or a waster of thy good,<br/>Or rich or poor; or else a man is wood.<br/>Albeit so, that no man finde shall<br/>None in this world, that trotteth whole in all,<br/>No man, nor beast, such as men can devise,<br/>But nathehess it ought enough suffice<br/>With any wife, if so were that she had<br/>More goode thewes than her vices bad:<br/>And all this asketh leisure to inquere.<br/>For, God it wot, I have wept many a tear<br/>Full privily, since I have had a wife.<br/>Praise whoso will a wedded manne's life,<br/>Certes, I find in it but cost and care,<br/>And observances of all blisses bare.<br/>And yet, God wot, my neighebours about,<br/>And namely of women many a rout,<br/>Say that I have the moste steadfast wife,<br/>And eke the meekest one, that beareth life.<br/>But I know best where wringeth me my shoe,<br/>Ye may for me right as you like do<br/>Advise you, ye be a man of age,<br/>How that ye enter into marriage;<br/>And namely with a young wife and a fair,<br/>By him that made water, fire, earth, air,<br/>The youngest man that is in all this rout<br/>Is busy enough to bringen it about<br/>To have his wife alone, truste me:<br/>Ye shall not please her fully yeares three,<br/>This is to say, to do her full pleasance.<br/>A wife asketh full many an observance.<br/>I pray you that ye be not evil apaid."<br/><br/>"Well," quoth this January, "and hast thou said?<br/>Straw for thy Senec, and for thy proverbs,<br/>I counte not a pannier full of herbs<br/>Of schoole termes; wiser men than thou,<br/>As thou hast heard, assented here right now<br/>To my purpose: Placebo, what say ye?"<br/>"I say it is a cursed man," quoth he,<br/>"That letteth matrimony, sickerly."<br/>And with that word they rise up suddenly,<br/>And be assented fully, that he should<br/>Be wedded when him list, and where he would.<br/><br/>High fantasy and curious business<br/>From day to day gan in the soul impress<br/>Of January about his marriage<br/>Many a fair  shape, and many a fair visage<br/>There passed through his hearte night by night.<br/>As whoso took a mirror polish'd bright,<br/>And set it in a common market-place,<br/>Then should he see many a figure pace<br/>By his mirror; and in the same wise<br/>Gan January in his thought devise<br/>Of maidens, which that dwelte him beside:<br/>He wiste not where that he might abide.<br/>For if that one had beauty in her face,<br/>Another stood so in the people's grace<br/>For her sadness and her benignity,<br/>That of the people greatest voice had she:<br/>And some were rich and had a badde name.<br/>But natheless, betwixt earnest and game,<br/>He at the last appointed him on one,<br/>And let all others from his hearte gon,<br/>And chose her of his own authority;<br/>For love is blind all day, and may not see.<br/>And when that he was into bed y-brought,<br/>He pourtray'd in his heart and in his thought<br/>Her freshe beauty, and her age tender,<br/>Her middle small, her armes long and slender,<br/>Her wise governance, her gentleness,<br/>Her womanly bearing, and her sadness.<br/>And when that he on her was condescended,<br/>He thought his choice might not be amended;<br/>For when that he himself concluded had,<br/>He thought each other manne' s wit so bad,<br/>That impossible it were to reply<br/>Against his choice; this was his fantasy.<br/>His friendes sent he to, at his instance,<br/>And prayed them to do him that pleasance,<br/>That hastily they would unto him come;<br/>He would abridge their labour all and some:<br/>Needed no more for them to go nor ride,<br/>He was appointed where he would abide.<br/><br/>Placebo came, and eke his friendes soon,<br/>And alderfirst he bade them all a boon,<br/>That none of them no arguments would make<br/>Against the purpose that he had y-take:<br/>Which purpose was pleasant to God, said he,<br/>And very ground of his prosperity.<br/>He said, there was a maiden in the town,<br/>Which that of beauty hadde great renown;<br/>All were it so she were of small degree,<br/>Sufficed him her youth and her beauty;<br/>Which maid, he said, he would have to his wife,<br/>To lead in ease and holiness his life;<br/>And thanked God, that he might have her all,<br/>That no wight with his blisse parte shall;<br/>And prayed them to labour in this need,<br/>And shape that he faile not to speed:<br/>For then, he said, his spirit was at ease.<br/>"Then is," quoth he, "nothing may me displease,<br/>Save one thing pricketh in my conscience,<br/>The which I will rehearse in your presence.<br/>I have," quoth he, "heard said, full yore ago,<br/>There may no man have perfect blisses two,<br/>This is to say, on earth and eke in heaven.<br/>For though he keep him from the sinne's seven,<br/>And eke from every branch of thilke tree,<br/>Yet is there so perfect felicity,<br/>And so great ease and lust, in marriage,<br/>That ev'r I am aghast, now in mine age<br/>That I shall head now so merry a life,<br/>So delicate, withoute woe or strife,<br/>That I shall have mine heav'n on earthe here.<br/>For since that very heav'n is bought so dear,<br/>With tribulation and great penance,<br/>How should I then, living in such pleasance<br/>As alle wedded men do with their wives,<br/>Come to the bliss where Christ etern on live is?<br/>This is my dread; and ye, my brethren tway,<br/>Assoile me this question, I you pray."<br/><br/>Justinus, which that hated his folly,<br/>Answer'd anon right in his japery;<br/>And, for he would his longe tale abridge,<br/>He woulde no authority allege,<br/>But saide; "Sir, so there be none obstacle<br/>Other than this, God of his high miracle,<br/>And of his mercy, may so for you wirch,<br/>That, ere ye have your rights of holy church,<br/>Ye may repent of wedded manne's life,<br/>In which ye say there is no woe nor strife:<br/>And elles God forbid, but if he sent<br/>A wedded man his grace him to repent<br/>Well often, rather than a single man.<br/>And therefore, Sir, the beste rede I can,<br/>Despair you not, but have in your memory,<br/>Paraventure she may be your purgatory;<br/>She may be Godde's means, and Godde's whip;<br/>And then your soul shall up to heaven skip<br/>Swifter than doth an arrow from a bow.<br/>I hope to God hereafter ye shall know<br/>That there is none so great felicity<br/>In marriage, nor ever more shall be,<br/>That you shall let of your salvation;<br/>So that ye use, as skill is and reason,<br/>The lustes of your wife attemperly,<br/>And that ye please her not too amorously,<br/>And that ye keep you eke from other sin.<br/>My tale is done, for my wit is but thin.<br/>Be not aghast hereof, my brother dear,<br/>But let us waden out of this mattere,<br/>The Wife of Bath, if ye have understand,<br/>Of marriage, which ye have now in hand,<br/>Declared hath full well in little space;<br/>Fare ye now well, God have you in his grace."<br/><br/>And with this word this Justin' and his brother<br/>Have ta'en their leave, and each of them of other.<br/>And when they saw that it must needes be,<br/>They wroughte so, by sleight and wise treaty,<br/>That she, this maiden, which that Maius hight,<br/>As hastily as ever that she might,<br/>Shall wedded be unto this January.<br/>I trow it were too longe you to tarry,<br/>If I told you of every script and band<br/>By which she was feoffed in his hand;<br/>Or for to reckon of her rich array<br/>But finally y-comen is the day<br/>That to the churche bothe be they went,<br/>For to receive the holy sacrament,<br/>Forth came the priest, with stole about his neck,<br/>And bade her be like Sarah and Rebecc'<br/>In wisdom and in truth of marriage;<br/>And said his orisons, as is usage,<br/>And crouched them, and prayed God should them bless,<br/>And made all sicker enough with holiness.<br/><br/>Thus be they wedded with solemnity;<br/>And at the feaste sat both he and she,<br/>With other worthy folk, upon the dais.<br/>All full of joy and bliss is the palace,<br/>And full of instruments, and of vitaille,<br/>The moste dainteous of all Itale.<br/>Before them stood such instruments of soun',<br/>That Orpheus, nor of Thebes Amphioun,<br/>Ne made never such a melody.<br/>At every course came in loud minstrelsy,<br/>That never Joab trumped for to hear,<br/>Nor he, Theodomas, yet half so clear<br/>At Thebes, when the city was in doubt.<br/>Bacchus the wine them skinked all about.<br/>And Venus laughed upon every wight<br/>(For January was become her knight,<br/>And woulde both assaye his courage<br/>In liberty, and eke in marriage),<br/>And with her firebrand in her hand about<br/>Danced before the bride and all the rout.<br/>And certainly I dare right well say this,<br/>Hymeneus, that god of wedding is,<br/>Saw never his life so merry a wedded man.<br/>Hold thou thy peace, thou poet Marcian,<br/>That writest us that ilke wedding merry<br/>Of her Philology and him Mercury,<br/>And of the songes that the Muses sung;<br/>Too small is both thy pen, and eke thy tongue<br/>For to describen of this marriage.<br/>When tender youth hath wedded stooping age,<br/>There is such mirth that it may not be writ;<br/>Assay it youreself, then may ye wit<br/>If that I lie or no in this mattere.<br/><br/>Maius, that sat with so benign a cheer,<br/>Her to behold it seemed faerie;<br/>Queen Esther never look'd with such an eye<br/>On Assuere, so meek a look had she;<br/>I may you not devise all her beauty;<br/>But thus much of her beauty tell I may,<br/>That she was hike the bright morrow of May<br/>Full filled of all beauty and pleasance.<br/>This January is ravish'd in a trance,<br/>At every time he looked in her face;<br/>But in his heart he gan her to menace,<br/>That he that night in armes would her strain<br/>Harder than ever Paris did Helene.<br/>But natheless yet had he great pity<br/>That thilke night offende her must he,<br/>And thought, "Alas, O tender creature,<br/>Now woulde God ye mighte well endure<br/>All my courage, it is so sharp and keen;<br/>I am aghast ye shall it not sustene.<br/>But God forbid that I did all my might.<br/>Now woulde God that it were waxen night,<br/>And that the night would lasten evermo'.<br/>I would that all this people were y-go."<br/>And finally he did all his labour,<br/>As he best mighte, saving his honour,<br/>To haste them from the meat in subtle wise.<br/><br/>The time came that reason was to rise;<br/>And after that men dance, and drinke fast,<br/>And spices all about the house they cast,<br/>And full of joy and bliss is every man,<br/>All but a squire, that highte Damian,<br/>Who carv'd before the knight full many a day;<br/>He was so ravish'd on his lady May,<br/>That for the very pain he was nigh wood;<br/>Almost he swelt and swooned where he stood,<br/>So sore had Venus hurt him with her brand,<br/>As that she bare it dancing in her hand.<br/>And to his bed he went him hastily;<br/>No more of him as at this time speak I;<br/>But there I let him weep enough and plain,<br/>Till freshe May will rue upon his pain.<br/>O perilous fire, that in the bedstraw breedeth!<br/>O foe familiar, that his service bedeth!<br/>O servant traitor, O false homely hewe,<br/>Like to the adder in bosom shy untrue,<br/>God shield us alle from your acquaintance!<br/>O January, drunken in pleasance<br/>Of marriage, see how thy Damian,<br/>Thine owen squier and thy boren man,<br/>Intendeth for to do thee villainy:<br/>God grante thee thine homehy foe t' espy.<br/>For in this world is no worse pestilence<br/>Than homely foe, all day in thy presence.<br/><br/>Performed hath the sun his arc diurn,<br/>No longer may the body of him sojourn<br/>On the horizon, in that latitude:<br/>Night with his mantle, that is dark and rude,<br/>Gan overspread the hemisphere about:<br/>For which departed is this lusty rout<br/>From January, with thank on every side.<br/>Home to their houses lustily they ride,<br/>Where as they do their thinges as them lest,<br/>And when they see their time they go to rest.<br/>Soon after that this hasty January<br/>Will go to bed, he will no longer tarry.<br/>He dranke hippocras, clarre, and vernage<br/>Of spices hot, to increase his courage;<br/>And many a lectuary had he full fine,<br/>Such as the cursed monk Dan Constantine<br/>Hath written in his book de Coitu;<br/>To eat them all he would nothing eschew:<br/>And to his privy friendes thus said he:<br/>"For Godde's love, as soon as it may be,<br/>Let voiden all this house in courteous wise."<br/>And they have done right as he will devise.<br/>Men drinken, and the travers draw anon;<br/>The bride is brought to bed as still as stone;<br/>And when the bed was with the priest y-bless'd,<br/>Out of the chamber every wight him dress'd,<br/>And January hath fast in arms y-take<br/>His freshe May, his paradise, his make.<br/>He lulled her, he kissed her full oft;<br/>With thicke bristles of his beard unsoft,<br/>Like to the skin of houndfish, sharp as brere<br/>(For he was shav'n all new in his mannere),<br/>He rubbed her upon her tender face,<br/>And saide thus; "Alas! I must trespace<br/>To you, my spouse, and you greatly offend,<br/>Ere time come that I will down descend.<br/>But natheless consider this," quoth he,<br/>"There is no workman, whatsoe'er he be,<br/>That may both worke well and hastily:<br/>This will be done at leisure perfectly.<br/>It is no force how longe that we play;<br/>In true wedlock coupled be we tway;<br/>And blessed be the yoke that we be in,<br/>For in our actes may there be no sin.<br/>A man may do no sinne with his wife,<br/>Nor hurt himselfe with his owen knife;<br/>For we have leave to play us by the law."<br/><br/>Thus labour'd he, till that the day gan daw,<br/>And then he took a sop in fine clarre,<br/>And upright in his bedde then sat he.<br/>And after that he sang full loud and clear,<br/>And kiss'd his wife, and made wanton cheer.<br/>He was all coltish, full of ragerie<br/>And full of jargon as a flecked pie.<br/>The slacke skin about his necke shaked,<br/>While that he sang, so chanted he and craked.<br/>But God wot what that May thought in her heart,<br/>When she him saw up sitting in his shirt<br/>In his night-cap, and with his necke lean:<br/>She praised not his playing worth a bean.<br/>Then said he thus; "My reste will I take<br/>Now day is come, I may no longer wake;<br/>And down he laid his head and slept till prime.<br/>And afterward, when that he saw his time,<br/>Up rose January, but freshe May<br/>Helde her chamber till the fourthe day,<br/>As usage is of wives for the best.<br/>For every labour some time must have rest,<br/>Or elles longe may he not endure;<br/>This is to say, no life of creature,<br/>Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.<br/><br/>Now will I speak of woeful Damian,<br/>That languisheth for love, as ye shall hear;<br/>Therefore I speak to him in this manneare.<br/>I say. "O silly Damian, alas!<br/>Answer to this demand, as in this case,<br/>How shalt thou to thy lady, freshe May,<br/>Telle thy woe? She will alway say nay;<br/>Eke if thou speak, she will thy woe bewray;<br/>God be thine help, I can no better say.<br/>This sicke Damian in Venus' fire<br/>So burned that he died for desire;<br/>For which he put his life in aventure,<br/>No longer might he in this wise endure;<br/>But privily a penner gan he borrow,<br/>And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,<br/>In manner of a complaint or a lay,<br/>Unto his faire freshe lady May.<br/>And in a purse of silk, hung on his shirt,<br/>He hath it put, and laid it at his heart.<br/><br/>The moone, that at noon was thilke day<br/>That January had wedded freshe May,<br/>In ten of Taure, was into Cancer glided;<br/>So long had Maius in her chamber abided,<br/>As custom is unto these nobles all.<br/>A bride shall not eaten in the ball<br/>Till dayes four, or three days at the least,<br/>Y-passed be; then let her go to feast.<br/>The fourthe day complete from noon to noon,<br/>When that the highe masse was y-done,<br/>In halle sat this January, and May,<br/>As fresh as is the brighte summer's day.<br/>And so befell, how that this goode man<br/>Remember'd him upon this Damian.<br/>And saide; "Saint Mary, how may this be,<br/>That Damian attendeth not to me?<br/>Is he aye sick? or how may this betide?"<br/>His squiers, which that stoode there beside,<br/>Excused him, because of his sickness,<br/>Which letted him to do his business:<br/>None other cause mighte make him tarry.<br/>"That me forthinketh," quoth this January<br/>"He is a gentle squier, by my truth;<br/>If that he died, it were great harm and ruth.<br/>He is as wise, as discreet, and secre',<br/>As any man I know of his degree,<br/>And thereto manly and eke serviceble,<br/>And for to be a thrifty man right able.<br/>But after meat, as soon as ever I may<br/>I will myself visit him, and eke May,<br/>To do him all the comfort that I can."<br/>And for that word him blessed every man,<br/>That of his bounty and his gentleness<br/>He woulde so comforten in sickness<br/>His squier, for it was a gentle deed.<br/><br/>"Dame," quoth this January, "take good heed,<br/>At after meat, ye with your women all<br/>(When that ye be in chamb'r out of this hall),<br/>That all ye go to see this Damian:<br/>Do him disport, he is a gentle man;<br/>And telle him that I will him visite,<br/>Have I nothing but rested me a lite:<br/>And speed you faste, for I will abide<br/>Till that ye sleepe faste by my side."<br/>And with that word he gan unto him call<br/>A squier, that was marshal of his hall,<br/>And told him certain thinges that he wo'ld.<br/>This freshe May hath straight her way y-hold,<br/>With all her women, unto Damian.<br/>Down by his beddes side sat she than,<br/>Comforting him as goodly as she may.<br/>This Damian, when that his time he say,<br/>In secret wise his purse, and eke his bill,<br/>In which that he y-written had his will,<br/>Hath put into her hand withoute more,<br/>Save that he sighed wondrous deep and sore,<br/>And softely to her right thus said he:<br/>"Mercy, and that ye not discover me:<br/>For I am dead if that this thing be kid."<br/>The purse hath she in her bosom hid,<br/>And went her way; ye get no more of me;<br/>But unto January come is she,<br/>That on his bedde's side sat full soft.<br/>He took her, and he kissed her full oft,<br/>And laid him down to sleep, and that anon.<br/>She feigned her as that she muste gon<br/>There as ye know that every wight must need;<br/>And when she of this bill had taken heed,<br/>She rent it all to cloutes at the last,<br/>And in the privy softely it cast.<br/>Who studieth now but faire freshe May?<br/>Adown by olde January she lay,<br/>That slepte, till the cough had him awaked:<br/>Anon he pray'd her strippe her all naked,<br/>He would of her, he said, have some pleasance;<br/>And said her clothes did him incumbrance.<br/>And she obey'd him, be her lefe or loth.<br/>But, lest that precious folk be with me wroth,<br/>How that he wrought I dare not to you tell,<br/>Or whether she thought it paradise or hell;<br/>But there I let them worken in their wise<br/>Till evensong ring, and they must arise.<br/><br/>Were it by destiny, or aventure,<br/>Were it by influence, or by nature,<br/>Or constellation, that in such estate<br/>The heaven stood at that time fortunate<br/>As for to put a bill of Venus' works<br/>(For alle thing hath time, as say these clerks),<br/>To any woman for to get her love,<br/>I cannot say; but greate God above,<br/>That knoweth that none act is causeless,<br/>He deem of all, for I will hold my peace.<br/>But sooth is this, how that this freshe May<br/>Hath taken such impression that day<br/>Of pity on this sicke Damian,<br/>That from her hearte she not drive can<br/>The remembrance for to do him ease.<br/>"Certain," thought she, "whom that this thing displease<br/>I recke not, for here I him assure,<br/>To love him best of any creature,<br/>Though he no more haddee than his shirt."<br/>Lo, pity runneth soon in gentle heart.<br/>Here may ye see, how excellent franchise<br/>In women is when they them narrow advise.<br/>Some tyrant is, -- as there be many a one, --<br/>That hath a heart as hard as any stone,<br/>Which would have let him sterven in the place<br/>Well rather than have granted him her grace;<br/>And then rejoicen in her cruel pride.<br/>And reckon not to be a homicide.<br/>This gentle May, full filled of pity,<br/>Right of her hand a letter maked she,<br/>In which she granted him her very grace;<br/>There lacked nought, but only day and place,<br/>Where that she might unto his lust suffice:<br/>For it shall be right as he will devise.<br/>And when she saw her time upon a day<br/>To visit this Damian went this May,<br/>And subtilly this letter down she thrust<br/>Under his pillow, read it if him lust.<br/>She took him by the hand, and hard him twist<br/>So secretly, that no wight of it wist,<br/>And bade him be all whole; and forth she went<br/>To January, when he for her sent.<br/>Up rose Damian the nexte morrow,<br/>All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.<br/>He combed him, he proined  him and picked,<br/>He did all that unto his lady liked;<br/>And eke to January he went as low<br/>As ever did a dogge for the bow.<br/>He is so pleasant unto every man<br/>(For craft is all, whoso that do it can),<br/>Every wight is fain to speak him good;<br/>And fully in his lady's grace he stood.<br/>Thus leave I Damian about his need,<br/>And in my tale forth I will proceed.<br/><br/>Some clerke holde that felicity<br/>Stands in delight; and therefore certain he,<br/>This noble January, with all his might<br/>In honest wise as longeth to a knight,<br/>Shope him to live full deliciously:<br/>His housing, his array, as honestly<br/>To his degree was maked as a king's.<br/>Amonges other of his honest things<br/>He had a garden walled all with stone;<br/>So fair a garden wot I nowhere none.<br/>For out of doubt I verily suppose<br/>That he that wrote the Romance of the Rose<br/>Could not of it the beauty well devise;<br/>Nor Priapus  mighte not well suffice,<br/>Though he be god of gardens, for to tell<br/>The beauty of the garden, and the well<br/>That stood under a laurel always green.<br/>Full often time he, Pluto, and his queen<br/>Proserpina, and all their faerie,<br/>Disported them and made melody<br/>About that well, and danced, as men told.<br/>This noble knight, this January old<br/>Such dainty had in it to walk and play,<br/>That he would suffer no wight to bear the key,<br/>Save he himself, for of the small wicket<br/>He bare always of silver a cliket,<br/>With which, when that him list, he it unshet.<br/>And when that he would pay his wife's debt,<br/>In summer season, thither would he go,<br/>And May his wife, and no wight but they two;<br/>And thinges which that were not done in bed,<br/>He in the garden them perform'd and sped.<br/>And in this wise many a merry day<br/>Lived this January and fresh May,<br/>But worldly joy may not always endure<br/>To January, nor to no creatucere.<br/><br/>O sudden hap!

Anon<br/>This January, as blind as is a stone,<br/>With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo',<br/>Into this freshe garden is y-go,<br/>And clapped to the wicket suddenly.<br/>"Now, wife," quoth he, "here is but thou and I;<br/>Thou art the creature that I beste love:<br/>For, by that Lord that sits in heav'n above,<br/>Lever I had to dien on a knife,<br/>Than thee offende, deare true wife.<br/>For Godde's sake, think how I thee chees,<br/>Not for no covetise doubteless,<br/>But only for the love I had to thee.<br/>And though that I be old, and may not see,<br/>Be to me true, and I will tell you why.<br/>Certes three thinges shall ye win thereby:<br/>First, love of Christ, and to yourself honour,<br/>And all mine heritage, town and tow'r.<br/>I give it you, make charters as you lest;<br/>This shall be done to-morrow ere sun rest,<br/>So wisly God my soule bring to bliss!<br/>I pray you, on this covenant me kiss.<br/>And though that I be jealous, wite me not;<br/>Ye be so deep imprinted in my thought,<br/>That when that I consider your beauty,<br/>And therewithal th'unlikely eld of me,<br/>I may not, certes, though I shoulde die,<br/>Forbear to be out of your company,<br/>For very love; this is withoute doubt:<br/>Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about."<br/><br/>This freshe May, when she these wordes heard,<br/>Benignely to January answer'd;<br/>But first and forward she began to weep:<br/>"I have," quoth she, "a soule for to keep<br/>As well as ye, and also mine honour,<br/>And of my wifehood thilke tender flow'r<br/>Which that I have assured in your hond,<br/>When that the priest to you my body bond:<br/>Wherefore I will answer in this mannere,<br/>With leave of you mine owen lord so dear.<br/>I pray to God, that never dawn the day<br/>That I no sterve, as foul as woman may,<br/>If e'er I do unto my kin that shame,<br/>Or elles I impaire so my name,<br/>That I bee false; and if I do that lack,<br/>Do strippe me, and put me in a sack,<br/>And in the nexte river do me drench:<br/>I am a gentle woman, and no wench.<br/>Why speak ye thus? but men be e'er untrue,<br/>And women have reproof of you aye new.<br/>Ye know none other dalliance, I believe,<br/>But speak to us of untrust and repreve."<br/><br/>And with that word she saw where Damian<br/>Sat in the bush, and coughe she began;<br/>And with her finger signe made she,<br/>That Damian should climb upon a tree<br/>That charged was with fruit; and up he went:<br/>For verily he knew all her intent,<br/>And every signe that she coulde make,<br/>Better than January her own make.<br/>For in a letter she had told him all<br/>Of this matter, how that he worke shall.<br/>And thus I leave him sitting in the perry,<br/>And January and May roaming full merry.<br/><br/>Bright was the day, and blue the firmament;<br/>Phoebus of gold his streames down had sent<br/>To gladden every flow'r with his warmness;<br/>He was that time in Geminis, I guess,<br/>But little from his declination<br/>Of Cancer, Jove's exaltation.<br/>And so befell, in that bright morning-tide,<br/>That in the garden, on the farther side,<br/>Pluto, that is the king of Faerie,<br/>And many a lady in his company<br/>Following his wife, the queen Proserpina, --<br/>Which that he ravished out of Ethna,<br/>While that she gather'd flowers in the mead<br/>(In Claudian ye may the story read,<br/>How in his grisly chariot he her fet), --<br/>This king of Faerie adown him set<br/>Upon a bank of turfes fresh and green,<br/>And right anon thus said he to his queen.<br/>"My wife," quoth he, "there may no wight say nay, --<br/>Experience so proves it every day, --<br/>The treason which that woman doth to man.<br/>Ten hundred thousand stories tell I can<br/>Notable of your untruth and brittleness<br/>O Solomon, richest of all richess,<br/>Full fill'd of sapience and worldly glory,<br/>Full worthy be thy wordes of memory<br/>To every wight that wit and reason can.<br/>Thus praised he yet the bounte of man:<br/>'Among a thousand men yet found I one,<br/>But of all women found I never none.'<br/>Thus said this king, that knew your wickedness;<br/>And Jesus, Filius Sirach,  as I guess,<br/>He spake of you but seldom reverence.<br/>A wilde fire and corrupt pestilence<br/>So fall upon your bodies yet to-night!<br/>Ne see ye not this honourable knight?<br/>Because, alas!
