# üíÆ Stanzas Composed During a Thunderstorm by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Chill and mirk is the nightly blast,<br/>  Where Pindus' mountains rise,<br/>And angry clouds are pouring fast<br/>  The vengeance of the skies.<br/><br/>Our guides are gone, our hope is lost,<br/>  And lightnings, as they play,<br/>But show where rocks our path have crost,<br/>  Or gild the torrent's spray.<br/><br/>Is yon a cot I saw, though low?<br/>  When lightning broke the gloom--<br/>How welcome were its shade!--ah, no!<br/>  'Tis but a Turkish tomb.<br/><br/>Through sounds of foaming waterfalls,<br/>  I hear a voice exclaim--<br/>My way-worn countryman, who calls<br/>  On distant England's name.<br/><br/>A shot is fired--by foe or friend?<br/>  Another--'tis to tell<br/>The mountain-peasants to descend,<br/>  And lead us where they dwell.<br/><br/>Oh! who in such a night will dare<br/>  To tempt the wilderness?<br/>And who 'mid thunder-peals can hear<br/>  Our signal of distress?<br/><br/>And who that heard our shouts would rise<br/>  To try the dubious road?<br/>Nor rather deem from nightly cries<br/>  That outlaws were abroad.<br/><br/>Clouds burst, skies flash, oh, dreadful hour!<br/>  More fiercely pours the storm!<br/>Yet here one thought has still the power<br/>  To keep my bosom warm.<br/><br/>While wandering through each broken path,<br/>  O'er brake and craggy brow;<br/>While elements exhaust their wrath,<br/>  Sweet Florence, where art thou?<br/><br/>Not on the sea, not on the sea--<br/>  Thy bark hath long been gone:<br/>Oh, may the storm that pours on me,<br/>  Bow down my head alone!<br/><br/>Full swiftly blew the swift Siroc,<br/>  When last I pressed thy lip;<br/>And long ere now, with foaming shock,<br/>  Impelled thy gallant ship.<br/><br/>Now thou art safe; nay, long ere now<br/>  Hast trod the shore of Spain;<br/>'Twere hard if aught so fair as thou<br/>  Should linger on the main.<br/><br/>And since I now remember thee<br/>  In darkness and in dread,<br/>As in those hours of revelry<br/>  Which Mirth and Music sped;<br/><br/>Do thou, amid the fair white walls,<br/>  If Cadiz yet be free,<br/>At times from out her latticed halls<br/>  Look o'er the dark blue sea;<br/><br/>Then think upon Calypso's isles,<br/>  Endeared by days gone by;<br/>To others give a thousand smiles,<br/>  To me a single sigh.<br/><br/>And when the admiring circle mark<br/>  The paleness of thy face,<br/>A half-formed tear, a transient spark<br/>  Of melancholy grace,<br/><br/>Again thou'lt smile, and blushing shun<br/>  Some coxcomb's raillery;<br/>Nor own for once thou thought'st on one,<br/>  Who ever thinks on thee.<br/><br/>Though smile and sigh alike are vain,<br/>  When severed hearts repine,<br/>My spirit flies o'er Mount and Main,<br/>  And mourns in search of _thine_.
