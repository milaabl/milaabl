# üíÆ Paradise Regained: The First Book by *John Milton*

<p>
    I, who erewhile the happy Garden sung<br/>By one man's disobedience lost, now sing<br/>Recovered Paradise to all mankind,<br/>By one man's firm obedience fully tried<br/>Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled<br/>In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,<br/>And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.<br/>  Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite<br/>Into the desert, his victorious field<br/>Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence<br/>By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,<br/>As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,<br/>And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds,<br/>With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds<br/>Above heroic, though in secret done,<br/>And unrecorded left through many an age:<br/>Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.<br/>  Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice<br/>More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried<br/>Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand<br/>To all baptized.  To his great baptism flocked<br/>With awe the regions round, and with them came<br/>From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed<br/>To the flood Jordan‚Äîcame as then obscure,<br/>Unmarked, unknown.  But him the Baptist soon<br/>Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore<br/>As to his worthier, and would have resigned<br/>To him his heavenly office.  Nor was long<br/>His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized<br/>Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove<br/>The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice<br/>From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.<br/>That heard the Adversary, who, roving still<br/>About the world, at that assembly famed<br/>Would not be last, and, with the voice divine<br/>Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom<br/>Such high attest was given a while surveyed<br/>With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,<br/>Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air<br/>To council summons all his mighty Peers,<br/>Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,<br/>A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,<br/>With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:‚Äî<br/>  "O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World<br/>(For much more willingly I mention Air,<br/>This our old conquest, than remember Hell,<br/>Our hated habitation), well ye know<br/>How many ages, as the years of men,<br/>This Universe we have possessed, and ruled<br/>In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,<br/>Since Adam and his facile consort Eve<br/>Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since<br/>With dread attending when that fatal wound<br/>Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve<br/>Upon my head.  Long the decrees of Heaven<br/>Delay, for longest time to Him is short;<br/>And now, too soon for us, the circling hours<br/>This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we<br/>Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound<br/>(At least, if so we can, and by the head<br/>Broken be not intended all our power<br/>To be infringed, our freedom and our being<br/>In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)‚Äî<br/>For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed,<br/>Destined to this, is late of woman born.<br/>His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;<br/>But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying<br/>All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve<br/>Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.<br/>Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim<br/>His coming, is sent harbinger, who all<br/>Invites, and in the consecrated stream<br/>Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so<br/>Purified to receive him pure, or rather<br/>To do him honour as their King.  All come,<br/>And he himself among them was baptized‚Äî<br/>Not thence to be more pure, but to receive<br/>The testimony of Heaven, that who he is<br/>Thenceforth the nations may not doubt.  I saw<br/>The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising<br/>Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds<br/>Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head<br/>A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant);<br/>And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,<br/>'This is my Son beloved,‚Äîin him am pleased.'<br/>His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire<br/>He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;<br/>And what will He not do to advance his Son?<br/>His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,<br/>When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;<br/>Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems<br/>In all his lineaments, though in his face<br/>The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.<br/>Ye see our danger on the utmost edge<br/>Of hazard, which admits no long debate,<br/>But must with something sudden be opposed<br/>(Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),<br/>Ere in the head of nations he appear,<br/>Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.<br/>I, when no other durst, sole undertook<br/>The dismal expedition to find out<br/>And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed<br/>Successfully: a calmer voyage now<br/>Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once<br/>Induces best to hope of like success."<br/>  He ended, and his words impression left<br/>Of much amazement to the infernal crew,<br/>Distracted and surprised with deep dismay<br/>At these sad tidings.  But no time was then<br/>For long indulgence to their fears or grief:<br/>Unanimous they all commit the care<br/>And management of this man enterprise<br/>To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt<br/>At first against mankind so well had thrived<br/>In Adam's overthrow, and led their march<br/>From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,<br/>Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,<br/>Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.<br/>So to the coast of Jordan he directs<br/>His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,<br/>Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,<br/>This man of men, attested Son of God,<br/>Temptation and all guile on him to try‚Äî<br/>So to subvert whom he suspected raised<br/>To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:<br/>But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled<br/>The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,<br/>Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright<br/>Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:‚Äî<br/>  "Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,<br/>Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth<br/>With Man or men's affairs, how I begin<br/>To verify that solemn message late,<br/>On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure<br/>In Galilee, that she should bear a son,<br/>Great in renown, and called the Son of God.<br/>Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be<br/>To her a virgin, that on her should come<br/>The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest<br/>O'ershadow her.  This Man, born and now upgrown,<br/>To shew him worthy of his birth divine<br/>And high prediction, henceforth I expose<br/>To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay<br/>His utmost subtlety, because he boasts<br/>And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng<br/>Of his Apostasy.  He might have learnt<br/>Less overweening, since he failed in Job,<br/>Whose constant perseverance overcame<br/>Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.<br/>He now shall know I can produce a man,<br/>Of female seed, far abler to resist<br/>All his solicitations, and at length<br/>All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell‚Äî<br/>Winning by conquest what the first man lost<br/>By fallacy surprised.  But first I mean<br/>To exercise him in the Wilderness;<br/>There he shall first lay down the rudiments<br/>Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth<br/>To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.<br/>By humiliation and strong sufferance<br/>His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength,<br/>And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;<br/>That all the Angels and aethereal Powers‚Äî<br/>They now, and men hereafter‚Äîmay discern<br/>From what consummate virtue I have chose<br/>This perfet man, by merit called my Son,<br/>To earn salvation for the sons of men."<br/>  So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven<br/>Admiring stood a space; then into hymns<br/>Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,<br/>Circling the throne and singing, while the hand<br/>Sung with the voice, and this the argument:‚Äî<br/>  "Victory and triumph to the Son of God,<br/>Now entering his great duel, not of arms,<br/>But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!<br/>The Father knows the Son; therefore secure<br/>Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,<br/>Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce,<br/>Allure, or terrify, or undermine.<br/>Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,<br/>And, devilish machinations, come to nought!"<br/>  So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.<br/>Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days<br/>Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,<br/>Musing and much revolving in his breast<br/>How best the mighty work he might begin<br/>Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first<br/>Publish his godlike office now mature,<br/>One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading<br/>And his deep thoughts, the better to converse<br/>With solitude, till, far from track of men,<br/>Thought following thought, and step by step led on,<br/>He entered now the bordering Desert wild,<br/>And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,<br/>His holy meditations thus pursued:‚Äî<br/>  "O what a multitude of thoughts at once<br/>Awakened in me swarm, while I consider<br/>What from within I feel myself, and hear<br/>What from without comes often to my ears,<br/>Ill sorting with my present state compared!<br/>When I was yet a child, no childish play<br/>To me was pleasing; all my mind was set<br/>Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,<br/>What might be public good; myself I thought<br/>Born to that end, born to promote all truth,<br/>All righteous things.  Therefore, above my years,<br/>The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;<br/>Made it my whole delight, and in it grew<br/>To such perfection that, ere yet my age<br/>Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast<br/>I went into the Temple, there to hear<br/>The teachers of our Law, and to propose<br/>What might improve my knowledge or their own,<br/>And was admired by all.  Yet this not all<br/>To which my spirit aspired.  Victorious deeds<br/>Flamed in my heart, heroic acts‚Äîone while<br/>To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;<br/>Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth,<br/>Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,<br/>Till truth were freed, and equity restored:<br/>Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first<br/>By winning words to conquer willing hearts,<br/>And make persuasion do the work of fear;<br/>At least to try, and teach the erring soul,<br/>Not wilfully misdoing, but unware<br/>Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.<br/>These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,<br/>By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,<br/>And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts,<br/>O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar<br/>To what highth sacred virtue and true worth<br/>Can raise them, though above example high;<br/>By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.<br/>For know, thou art no son of mortal man;<br/>Though men esteem thee low of parentage,<br/>Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules<br/>All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.<br/>A messenger from God foretold thy birth<br/>Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold<br/>Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,<br/>And of thy kingdom there should be no end.<br/>At thy nativity a glorious quire<br/>Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung<br/>To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,<br/>And told them the Messiah now was born,<br/>Where they might see him; and to thee they came,<br/>Directed to the manger where thou lay'st;<br/>For in the inn was left no better room.<br/>A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,<br/>Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,<br/>To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;<br/>By whose bright course led on they found the place,<br/>Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,<br/>By which they knew thee King of Israel born.<br/>Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned<br/>By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,<br/>Before the altar and the vested priest,<br/>Like things of thee to all that present stood.'<br/>This having heart, straight I again revolved<br/>The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ<br/>Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes<br/>Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake<br/>I am‚Äîthis chiefly, that my way must lie<br/>Through many a hard assay, even to the death,<br/>Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,<br/>Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins'<br/>Full weight must be transferred upon my head.<br/>Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,<br/>The time prefixed I waited; when behold<br/>The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,<br/>Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come<br/>Before Messiah, and his way prepare!<br/>I, as all others, to his baptism came,<br/>Which I believed was from above; but he<br/>Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed<br/>Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)‚Äî<br/>Me him whose harbinger he was; and first<br/>Refused on me his baptism to confer,<br/>As much his greater, and was hardly won.<br/>But, as I rose out of the laving stream,<br/>Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence<br/>The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;<br/>And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice,<br/>Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,<br/>Me his beloved Son, in whom alone<br/>He was well pleased: by which I knew the time<br/>Now full, that I no more should live obscure,<br/>But openly begin, as best becomes<br/>The authority which I derived from Heaven.<br/>And now by some strong motion I am led<br/>Into this wilderness; to what intent<br/>I learn not yet.  Perhaps I need not know;<br/>For what concerns my knowledge God reveals."<br/>  So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,<br/>And, looking round, on every side beheld<br/>A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.<br/>The way he came, not having marked return,<br/>Was difficult, by human steps untrod;<br/>And he still on was led, but with such thoughts<br/>Accompanied of things past and to come<br/>Lodged in his breast as well might recommend<br/>Such solitude before choicest society.<br/>  Full forty days he passed‚Äîwhether on hill<br/>Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night<br/>Under the covert of some ancient oak<br/>Or cedar to defend him from the dew,<br/>Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;<br/>Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,<br/>Till those days ended; hungered then at last<br/>Among wild beasts.  They at his sight grew mild,<br/>Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk<br/>The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;<br/>The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.<br/>But now an aged man in rural weeds,<br/>Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,<br/>Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve<br/>Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen,<br/>To warm him wet returned from field at eve,<br/>He saw approach; who first with curious eye<br/>Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:‚Äî<br/>  "Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,<br/>So far from path or road of men, who pass<br/>In troop or caravan? for single none<br/>Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here<br/>His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.<br/>I ask the rather, and the more admire,<br/>For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late<br/>Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford<br/>Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son<br/>Of God.  I saw and heard, for we sometimes<br/>Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth<br/>To town or village nigh (nighest is far),<br/>Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,<br/>What happens new; fame also finds us out."<br/>  To whom the Son of God:‚Äî"Who brought me hither<br/>Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek."<br/>  "By miracle he may," replied the swain;<br/>"What other way I see not; for we here<br/>Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured<br/>More than the camel, and to drink go far‚Äî<br/>Men to much misery and hardship born.<br/>But, if thou be the Son of God, command<br/>That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;<br/>So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve<br/>With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste."<br/>  He ended, and the Son of God replied:‚Äî<br/>"Think'st thou such force in bread?  Is it not written<br/>(For I discern thee other than thou seem'st),<br/>Man lives not by bread only, but each word<br/>Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed<br/>Our fathers here with manna?  In the Mount<br/>Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;<br/>And forty days Eliah without food<br/>Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.<br/>Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust<br/>Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?"<br/>  Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:‚Äî<br/>"'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate<br/>Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,<br/>Kept not my happy station, but was driven<br/>With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep‚Äî<br/>Yet to that hideous place not so confined<br/>By rigour unconniving but that oft,<br/>Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy<br/>Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,<br/>Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens<br/>Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.<br/>I came, among the Sons of God, when he<br/>Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,<br/>To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;<br/>And, when to all his Angels he proposed<br/>To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,<br/>That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,<br/>I undertook that office, and the tongues<br/>Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies<br/>To his destruction, as I had in charge:<br/>For what he bids I do.  Though I have lost<br/>Much lustre of my native brightness, lost<br/>To be beloved of God, I have not lost<br/>To love, at least contemplate and admire,<br/>What I see excellent in good, or fair,<br/>Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.<br/>What can be then less in me than desire<br/>To see thee and approach thee, whom I know<br/>Declared the Son of God, to hear attent<br/>Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?<br/>Men generally think me much a foe<br/>To all mankind.  Why should I? they to me<br/>Never did wrong or violence.  By them<br/>I lost not what I lost; rather by them<br/>I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell<br/>Copartner in these regions of the World,<br/>If not disposer‚Äîlend them oft my aid,<br/>Oft my advice by presages and signs,<br/>And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,<br/>Whereby they may direct their future life.<br/>Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain<br/>Companions of my misery and woe!<br/>At first it may be; but, long since with woe<br/>Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof<br/>That fellowship in pain divides not smart,<br/>Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load;<br/>Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.<br/>This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,<br/>Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more."<br/>  To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:‚Äî<br/>"Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies<br/>From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,<br/>Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come<br/>Into the Heaven of Heavens.  Thou com'st, indeed,<br/>As a poor miserable captive thrall<br/>Comes to the place where he before had sat<br/>Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,<br/>Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,<br/>A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,<br/>To all the host of Heaven.  The happy place<br/>Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy‚Äî<br/>Rather inflames thy torment, representing<br/>Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;<br/>So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.<br/>But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King!<br/>Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear<br/>Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?<br/>What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem<br/>Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him<br/>With all inflictions? but his patience won.<br/>The other service was thy chosen task,<br/>To be a liar in four hundred mouths;<br/>For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.<br/>Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles<br/>By thee are given, and what confessed more true<br/>Among the nations?  That hath been thy craft,<br/>By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.<br/>But what have been thy answers? what but dark,<br/>Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,<br/>Which they who asked have seldom understood,<br/>And, not well understood, as good not known?<br/>Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,<br/>Returned the wiser, or the more instruct<br/>To fly or follow what concerned him most,<br/>And run not sooner to his fatal snare?<br/>For God hath justly given the nations up<br/>To thy delusions; justly, since they fell<br/>Idolatrous.  But, when his purpose is<br/>Among them to declare his providence,<br/>To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,<br/>But from him, or his Angels president<br/>In every province, who, themselves disdaining<br/>To approach thy temples, give thee in command<br/>What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say<br/>To thy adorers?  Thou, with trembling fear,<br/>Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st;<br/>Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold.<br/>But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;<br/>No more shalt thou by oracling abuse<br/>The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,<br/>And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice<br/>Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere‚Äî<br/>At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.<br/>God hath now sent his living Oracle<br/>Into the world to teach his final will,<br/>And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell<br/>In pious hearts, an inward oracle<br/>To all truth requisite for men to know."<br/>  So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,<br/>Though inly stung with anger and disdain,<br/>Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:‚Äî<br/>  "Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,<br/>And urged me hard with doings which not will,<br/>But misery, hath wrested from me.  Where<br/>Easily canst thou find one miserable,<br/>And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,<br/>If it may stand him more in stead to lie,<br/>Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?<br/>But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;<br/>From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure<br/>Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.<br/>Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,<br/>Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,<br/>And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;<br/>What wonder, then, if I delight to hear<br/>Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire<br/>Virtue who follow not her lore.  Permit me<br/>To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),<br/>And talk at least, though I despair to attain.<br/>Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,<br/>Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest<br/>To tread his sacred courts, and minister<br/>About his altar, handling holy things,<br/>Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice<br/>To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet<br/>Inspired: disdain not such access to me."<br/>  To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:‚Äî<br/>"Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,<br/>I bid not, or forbid.  Do as thou find'st<br/>Permission from above; thou canst not more."<br/>  He added not; and Satan, bowling low<br/>His gray dissimulation, disappeared,<br/>Into thin air diffused: for now began<br/>Night with her sullen wing to double-shade<br/>The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;<br/>And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.
