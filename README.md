# üíÆ Manfred: A Dramatic Poem by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
            "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br/>                Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."<br/>                       [_Hamlet,_ Act i. Scene 5, Lines 166, 167.<br/><br/>_The Scene of the Drama is amongst the Higher Alps--partly in the<br/>         Castle of Manfred, and partly in the Mountains._<br/><br/>ACT 1.<br/><br/>SCENE 1.--Manfred _alone_.--_Scene, a Gothic Gallery._--<br/>                        _Time, Midnight._<br/><br/>_Man_. The lamp must be replenished, but even then<br/>It will not burn so long as I must watch:<br/>My slumbers--if I slumber--are not sleep,<br/>But a continuance, of enduring thought,<br/>Which then I can resist not: in my heart<br/>There is a vigil, and these eyes but close<br/>To look within; and yet I live, and bear<br/>The aspect and the form of breathing men.<br/>But Grief should be the Instructor of the wise;<br/>Sorrow is Knowledge: they who know the most<br/>Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth,<br/>The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life.<br/>Philosophy and science, and the springs<br/>Of Wonder, and the wisdom of the World,<br/>I have essayed, and in my mind there is<br/>A power to make these subject to itself--<br/>But they avail not: I have done men good,<br/>And I have met with good even among men--<br/>But this availed not: I have had my foes,<br/>And none have baffled, many fallen before me--<br/>But this availed not:--Good--or evil--life--<br/>Powers, passions--all I see in other beings,<br/>Have been to me as rain unto the sands,<br/>Since that all-nameless hour. I have no dread,<br/>And feel the curse to have no natural fear,<br/>Nor fluttering throb, that beats with hopes or wishes,<br/>Or lurking love of something on the earth.<br/>Now to my task.--<br/>                 Mysterious Agency!<br/>Ye Spirits of the unbounded Universe!<br/>Whom I have sought in darkness and in light--<br/>Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell<br/>In subtler essence--ye, to whom the tops<br/>Of mountains inaccessible are haunts,<br/>And Earth's and Ocean's caves familiar things--<br/>I call upon ye by the written charm<br/>Which gives me power upon you--Rise! Appear!<br/>                                                             [A pause.<br/>They come not yet.--Now by the voice of him<br/>Who is the first among you--by this sign,<br/>Which makes you tremble--by the claims of him<br/>Who is undying,--Rise! Appear!----Appear!<br/>                                                             [A pause.<br/>If it be so.--Spirits of Earth and Air,<br/>Ye shall not so elude me! By a power,<br/>Deeper than all yet urged, a tyrant-spell,<br/>Which had its birthplace in a star condemned,<br/>The burning wreck of a demolished world,<br/>A wandering hell in the eternal Space;<br/>By the strong curse which is upon my Soul,<br/>The thought which is within me and around me,<br/>I do compel ye to my will.--Appear!<br/><br/>                          First Spirit.<br/><br/>  Mortal! to thy bidding bowed,<br/>  From my mansion in the cloud,<br/>  Which the breath of Twilight builds,<br/>  And the Summer's sunset gilds<br/>  With the azure and vermilion,<br/>  Which is mixed for my pavilion;<br/>  Though thy quest may be forbidden,<br/>  On a star-beam I have ridden,<br/>  To thine adjuration bowed:<br/>  Mortal--be thy wish avowed!<br/><br/>                  _Voice of the_ Second Spirit.<br/><br/>Mont Blanc is the Monarch of mountains;<br/>  They crowned him long ago<br/>On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,<br/>  With a Diadem of snow.<br/>Around his waist are forests braced,<br/>  The Avalanche in his hand;<br/>But ere it fall, that thundering ball<br/>  Must pause for my command.<br/>The Glacier's cold and restless mass<br/>  Moves onward day by day;<br/>But I am he who bids it pass,<br/>  Or with its ice delay.<br/>I am the Spirit of the place,<br/>  Could make the mountain bow<br/>And quiver to his caverned base--<br/>  And what with me would'st _Thou?_<br/><br/>                   _Voice of the_ Third Spirit.<br/><br/>In the blue depth of the waters,<br/>  Where the wave hath no strife,<br/>Where the Wind is a stranger,<br/>  And the Sea-snake hath life,<br/>Where the Mermaid is decking<br/>  Her green hair with shells,<br/>Like the storm on the surface<br/>  Came the sound of thy spells;<br/>O'er my calm Hall of Coral<br/>  The deep Echo rolled--<br/>To the Spirit of Ocean<br/>  Thy wishes unfold!<br/><br/>                          FOURTH SPIRIT.<br/><br/>Where the slumbering Earthquake<br/>  Lies pillowed on fire,<br/>And the lakes of bitumen<br/>  Rise boilingly higher;<br/>Where the roots of the Andes<br/>  Strike deep in the earth,<br/>As their summits to heaven<br/>  Shoot soaringly forth;<br/>I have quitted my birthplace,<br/>  Thy bidding to bide--<br/>Thy spell hath subdued me,<br/>  Thy will be my guide!<br/><br/>                          FIFTH SPIRIT.<br/><br/>I am the Rider of the wind,<br/>  The Stirrer of the storm;<br/>The hurricane I left behind<br/>  Is yet with lightning warm;<br/>To speed to thee, o'er shore and sea<br/>  I swept upon the blast:<br/>The fleet I met sailed well--and yet<br/>  'Twill sink ere night be past.<br/><br/>                          SIXTH SPIRIT.<br/><br/>My dwelling is the shadow of the Night,<br/>Why doth thy magic torture me with light?<br/><br/>                         SEVENTH SPIRIT.<br/><br/>The Star which rules thy destiny no<br/>Was ruled, ere earth began, by me:<br/>It was a World as fresh and fair<br/>As e'er revolved round Sun in air;<br/>Its course was free and regular,<br/>Space bosomed not a lovelier star.<br/>The Hour arrived--and it became<br/>A wandering mass of shapeless flame,<br/>A pathless Comet, and a curse,<br/>The menace of the Universe;<br/>Still rolling on with innate force,<br/>Without a sphere, without a course,<br/>A bright deformity on high,<br/>The monster of the upper sky!<br/>And Thou! beneath its influence born--<br/>Thou worm! whom I obey and scorn--<br/>Forced by a Power (which is not thine,<br/>And lent thee but to make thee mine)<br/>For this brief moment to descend,<br/>Where these weak Spirits round thee bend<br/>And parley with a thing like thee--<br/>What would'st thou, Child of Clay! with me?<br/><br/>                       _The_ SEVEN SPIRITS.<br/><br/>Earth--ocean--air--night--mountains--winds--thy Star,<br/>  Are at thy beck and bidding, Child of Clay!<br/>Before thee at thy quest their Spirits are--<br/>  What would'st thou with us, Son of mortals--say?<br/><br/>_Man_. Forgetfulness----<br/><br/>_First Spirit_.            Of what--of whom--and why?<br/><br/>_Man_. Of that which is within me; read it there--<br/>Ye know it--and I cannot utter it.<br/><br/>_Spirit_. We can but give thee that which we possess:<br/>Ask of us subjects, sovereignty, the power<br/>O'er earth--the whole, or portion--or a sign<br/>Which shall control the elements, whereof<br/>We are the dominators,--each and all,<br/>These shall be thine.<br/><br/>_Man_.                Oblivion--self-oblivion!<br/>Can ye not wring from out the hidden realms<br/>Ye offer so profusely--what I ask?<br/><br/>_Spirit_. It is not in our essence, in our skill;<br/>But--thou may'st die.<br/><br/>_Man_.                Will Death bestow it on me?<br/><br/>_Spirit_. We are immortal, and do not forget;<br/>We are eternal; and to us the past<br/>Is, as the future, present. Art thou answered?<br/><br/>_Man_. Ye mock me--but the Power which brought ye here<br/>Hath made you mine. Slaves, scoff not at my will!<br/>The Mind--the Spirit--the Promethean spark,<br/>The lightning of my being, is as bright,<br/>Pervading, and far darting as your own,<br/>And shall not yield to yours, though cooped in clay!<br/>Answer, or I will teach you what I am.<br/><br/>_Spirit_. We answer--as we answered; our reply<br/>Is even in thine own words.<br/><br/>_Man_.                      Why say ye so?<br/><br/>_Spirit_. If, as thou say'st, thine essence be as ours,<br/>We have replied in telling thee, the thing<br/>Mortals call death hath nought to do with us.<br/><br/>_Man_. I then have called ye from your realms in vain;<br/>Ye cannot, or ye will not, aid me.<br/><br/>_Spirit_.                         Say--<br/>What we possess we offer; it is thine:<br/>Bethink ere thou dismiss us; ask again;<br/>Kingdom, and sway, and strength, and length of days--<br/><br/>_Man_. Accurs√©d! what have I to do with days?<br/>They are too long already.--Hence--begone!<br/><br/>_Spirit_. Yet pause: being here, our will would do thee service;<br/>Bethink thee, is there then no other gift<br/>Which we can make not worthless in thine eyes?<br/><br/>_Man._ No, none: yet stay--one moment, ere we part,<br/>I would behold ye face to face. I hear<br/>Your voices, sweet and melancholy sounds,<br/>As Music on the waters; and I see<br/>The steady aspect of a clear large Star;<br/>But nothing more. Approach me as ye are,<br/>Or one--or all--in your accustomed forms.<br/><br/>_Spirit_. We have no forms, beyond the elements<br/>Of which we are the mind and principle:<br/>But choose a form--in that we will appear.<br/><br/>_Man_. I have no choice; there is no form on earth<br/>Hideous or beautiful to me. Let him,<br/>Who is most powerful of ye, take such aspect<br/>As unto him may seem most fitting--Come!<br/><br/>_Seventh Spirit (appearing in the shape of a beautiful<br/>female figure)_. Behold!<br/><br/>_Man_.        Oh God! if it be thus, and _thou_<br/>Art not a madness and a mockery,<br/>I yet might be most happy. I will clasp thee,<br/>And we again will be----<br/>                                               [_The figure vanishes._<br/>                        My heart is crushed!<br/>                                           [MANFRED _falls senseless_.<br/><br/>   (_A voice is heard in the Incantation which follows._)<br/><br/>    When the Moon is on the wave,<br/>      And the glow-worm in the grass,<br/>    And the meteor on the grave,<br/>      And the wisp on the morass;<br/>    When the falling stars are shooting,<br/>    And the answered owls are hooting,<br/>    And the silent leaves are still<br/>    In the shadow of the hill,<br/>    Shall my soul be upon thine,<br/>    With a power and with a sign.<br/><br/>    Though thy slumber may be deep,<br/>    Yet thy Spirit shall not sleep;<br/>    There are shades which will not vanish,<br/>    There are thoughts thou canst not banish;<br/>    By a Power to thee unknown,<br/>    Thou canst never be alone;<br/>    Thou art wrapt as with a shroud,<br/>    Thou art gathered in a cloud;<br/>    And for ever shalt thou dwell<br/>    In the spirit of this spell.<br/><br/>    Though thou seest me not pass by,<br/>    Thou shalt feel me with thine eye<br/>    As a thing that, though unseen,<br/>    Must be near thee, and hath been;<br/>    And when in that secret dread<br/>    Thou hast turned around thy head,<br/>    Thou shalt marvel I am not<br/>    As thy shadow on the spot,<br/>    And the power which thou dost feel<br/>    Shall be what thou must conceal.<br/><br/>    And a magic voice and verse<br/>    Hath baptized thee with a curse;<br/>    And a Spirit of the air<br/>    Hath begirt thee with a snare;<br/>    In the wind there is a voice<br/>    Shall forbid thee to rejoice;<br/>    And to thee shall Night deny<br/>    All the quiet of her sky;<br/>    And the day shall have a sun,<br/>    Which shall make thee wish it done.<br/><br/>    From thy false tears I did distil<br/>    An essence which hath strength to kill;<br/>    From thy own heart I then did wring<br/>    The black blood in its blackest spring;<br/>    From thy own smile I snatched the snake,<br/>    For there it coiled as in a brake;<br/>    From thy own lip I drew the charm<br/>    Which gave all these their chiefest harm;<br/>    In proving every poison known,<br/>    I found the strongest was thine own.<br/><br/>    By the cold breast and serpent smile,<br/>    By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,<br/>    By that most seeming virtuous eye,<br/>    By thy shut soul's hypocrisy;<br/>    By the perfection of thine art<br/>    Which passed for human thine own heart;<br/>    By thy delight in others' pain,<br/>    And by thy brotherhood of Cain,<br/>    I call upon thee! and compel<br/>    Thyself to be thy proper Hell!<br/><br/>    And on thy head I pour the vial<br/>    Which doth devote thee to this trial;<br/>    Nor to slumber, nor to die,<br/>    Shall be in thy destiny;<br/>    Though thy death shall still seem near<br/>    To thy wish, but as a fear;<br/>    Lo! the spell now works around thee,<br/>    And the clankless chain hath bound thee;<br/>    O'er thy heart and brain together<br/>    Hath the word been passed--now wither!<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_The Mountain of the Jungfrau_.--<br/>        _Time, Morning_.--MANFRED _alone upon the cliffs._<br/><br/>_Man_. The spirits I have raised abandon me,<br/>The spells which I have studied baffle me,<br/>The remedy I recked of tortured me<br/>I lean no more on superhuman aid;<br/>It hath no power upon the past, and for<br/>The future, till the past be gulfed in darkness,<br/>It is not of my search.--My Mother Earth!<br/>And thou fresh-breaking Day, and you, ye Mountains,<br/>Why are ye beautiful? I cannot love ye.<br/>And thou, the bright Eye of the Universe,<br/>That openest over all, and unto all<br/>Art a delight--thou shin'st not on my heart.<br/>And you, ye crags, upon whose extreme edge<br/>I stand, and on the torrent's brink beneath<br/>Behold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs<br/>In dizziness of distance; when a leap,<br/>A stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring<br/>My breast upon its rocky bosom's bed<br/>To rest for ever--wherefore do I pause?<br/>I feel the impulse--yet I do not plunge;<br/>I see the peril--yet do not recede;<br/>And my brain reels--and yet my foot is firm:<br/>There is a power upon me which withholds,<br/>And makes it my fatality to live,--<br/>If it be life to wear within myself<br/>This barrenness of Spirit, and to be<br/>My own Soul's sepulchre, for I have ceased<br/>To justify my deeds unto myself--<br/>The last infirmity of evil. Aye,<br/>Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister,<br/>                                                   [_An Eagle passes._<br/>Whose happy flight is highest into heaven,<br/>Well may'st thou swoop so near me--I should be<br/>Thy prey, and gorge thine eaglets; thou art gone<br/>Where the eye cannot follow thee; but thine<br/>Yet pierces downward, onward, or above,<br/>With a pervading vision.--Beautiful!<br/>How beautiful is all this visible world!<br/>How glorious in its action and itself!<br/>But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,<br/>Half dust, half deity, alike unfit<br/>To sink or soar, with our mixed essence make<br/>A conflict of its elements, and breathe<br/>The breath of degradation and of pride,<br/>Contending with low wants and lofty will,<br/>Till our Mortality predominates,<br/>And men are--what they name not to themselves,<br/>And trust not to each other. Hark! the note,<br/>                      [_The Shepherd's pipe in the distance is heard._<br/>The natural music of the mountain reed--<br/>For here the patriarchal days are not<br/>A pastoral fable--pipes in the liberal air,<br/>Mixed with the sweet bells of the sauntering herd;<br/>My soul would drink those echoes. Oh, that I were<br/>The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,<br/>A living voice, a breathing harmony,<br/>A bodiless enjoyment--born and dying<br/>With the blest tone which made me!<br/><br/>               _Enter from below a_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.<br/><br/>_Chamois Hunter_.                 Even so<br/>This way the Chamois leapt: her nimble feet<br/>Have baffled me; my gains to-day will scarce<br/>Repay my break-neck travail.--What is here?<br/>Who seems not of my trade, and yet hath reached<br/>A height which none even of our mountaineers,<br/>Save our best hunters, may attain: his garb<br/>Is goodly, his mien manly, and his air<br/>Proud as a free-born peasant's, at this distance:<br/>I will approach him nearer.<br/><br/>_Man_. (_not perceiving the other_). To be thus--<br/>Grey-haired with anguish, like these blasted pines,<br/>Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless,<br/>A blighted trunk upon a curs√©d root,<br/>Which but supplies a feeling to Decay--<br/>And to be thus, eternally but thus,<br/>Having been otherwise! Now furrowed o'er<br/>With wrinkles, ploughed by moments, not by years<br/>And hours, all tortured into ages--hours<br/>Which I outlive!--Ye toppling crags of ice!<br/>Ye Avalanches, whom a breath draws down<br/>In mountainous o'erwhelming, come and crush me!<br/>I hear ye momently above, beneath,<br/>Crash with a frequent conflict; but ye pass,<br/>And only fall on things that still would live;<br/>On the young flourishing forest, or the hut<br/>And hamlet of the harmless villager.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. The mists begin to rise from up the valley;<br/>I'll warn him to descend, or he may chance<br/>To lose at once his way and life together.<br/><br/>_Man_. The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds<br/>Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,<br/>Like foam from the roused ocean of deep Hell,<br/>Whose every wave breaks on a living shore,<br/>Heaped with the damned like pebbles.--I am giddy.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. I must approach him cautiously; if near,<br/>A sudden step will startle him, and he<br/>Seems tottering already.<br/><br/>_Man_.                  Mountains have fallen,<br/>Leaving a gap in the clouds, and with the shock<br/>Rocking their Alpine brethren; filling up<br/>The ripe green valleys with Destruction's splinters;<br/>Damming the rivers with a sudden dash,<br/>Which crushed the waters into mist, and made<br/>Their fountains find another channel--thus,<br/>Thus, in its old age, did Mount Rosenberg--<br/>Why stood I not beneath it?<br/><br/>_C. Hun_.                  Friend! have a care,<br/>Your next step may be fatal!--for the love<br/>Of Him who made you, stand not on that brink!<br/><br/>_Man_. (_not hearing him_).<br/>Such would have been for me a fitting tomb;<br/>My bones had then been quiet in their depth;<br/>They had not then been strewn upon the rocks<br/>For the wind's pastime--as thus--thus they shall be--<br/>In this one plunge.--Farewell, ye opening Heavens!<br/>Look not upon me thus reproachfully--<br/>You were not meant for me--Earth! take these atoms!<br/><br/>     [_As_ MANFRED _is in act to spring from the cliff, the_<br/>  CHAMOIS HUNTER _seizes and retains him with a sudden grasp._<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. Hold, madman!--though aweary of thy life,<br/>Stain not our pure vales with thy guilty blood:<br/>Away with me----I will not quit my hold.<br/><br/>_Man_. I am most sick at heart--nay, grasp me not--<br/>I am all feebleness--the mountains whirl<br/>Spinning around me----I grow blind----What art thou?<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. I'll answer that anon.--Away with me----<br/>The clouds grow thicker----there--now lean on me--<br/>Place your foot here--here, take this staff, and cling<br/>A moment to that shrub--now give me your hand,<br/>And hold fast by my girdle--softly--well--<br/>The Chalet will be gained within an hour:<br/>Come on, we'll quickly find a surer footing,<br/>And something like a pathway, which the torrent<br/>Hath washed since winter.--Come,'tis bravely done--<br/>You should have been a hunter.--Follow me.<br/><br/>       [_As they descend the rocks with difficulty, the scene closes._<br/><br/>ACT II.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A Cottage among the Bernese Alps_.--<br/>                MANFRED _and the_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. No--no--yet pause--thou must not yet go forth;<br/>Thy mind and body are alike unfit<br/>To trust each other, for some hours, at least;<br/>When thou art better, I will be thy guide--<br/>But whither?<br/><br/>_Man_.       It imports not: I do know<br/>My route full well, and need no further guidance.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. Thy garb and gait bespeak thee of high lineage--<br/>One of the many chiefs, whose castled crags<br/>Look o'er the lower valleys--which of these<br/>May call thee lord? I only know their portals;<br/>My way of life leads me but rarely down<br/>To bask by the huge hearths of those old halls,<br/>Carousing with the vassals; but the paths,<br/>Which step from out our mountains to their doors,<br/>I know from childhood--which of these is thine?<br/><br/>_Man_. No matter.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_.         Well, Sir, pardon me the question,<br/>And be of better cheer. Come, taste my wine;<br/>'Tis of an ancient vintage; many a day<br/>'T has thawed my veins among our glaciers, now<br/>Let it do thus for thine--Come, pledge me fairly!<br/><br/>_Man_. Away, away! there's blood upon the brim!<br/>Will it then never--never sink in the earth?<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. What dost thou mean? thy senses wander from thee.<br/><br/>_Man_. I say 'tis blood--my blood! the pure warm stream<br/>Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours<br/>When we were in our youth, and had one heart,<br/>And loved each other as we should not love,<br/>And this was shed: but still it rises up,<br/>Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from Heaven,<br/>Where thou art not--and I shall never be.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. Man of strange words, and some half-maddening sin,<br/>Which makes thee people vacancy, whate'er<br/>Thy dread and sufferance be, there's comfort yet--<br/>The aid of holy men, and heavenly patience----<br/><br/>_Man_. Patience--and patience! Hence--that word was made<br/>For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!<br/>Preach it to mortals of a dust like thine,--<br/>I am not of thine order.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_.                Thanks to Heaven!<br/>I would not be of thine for the free fame<br/>Of William Tell; but whatsoe'er thine ill,<br/>It must be borne, and these wild starts are useless.<br/><br/>_Man_. Do I not bear it?--Look on me--I live.<br/><br/>_C. Hun._ This is convulsion, and no healthful life.<br/><br/>_Man_. I tell thee, man! I have lived many years,<br/>Many long years, but they are nothing now<br/>To those which I must number: ages--ages--<br/>Space and eternity--and consciousness,<br/>With the fierce thirst of death--and still unslaked!<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. Why on thy brow the seal of middle age<br/>Hath scarce been set; I am thine elder far.<br/><br/>_Man_. Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?<br/>It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine<br/>Have made my days and nights imperishable,<br/>Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,<br/>Innumerable atoms; and one desert,<br/>Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,<br/>But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,<br/>Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. Alas! he's mad--but yet I must not leave him.<br/><br/>_Man_. I would I were--for then the things I see<br/>Would be but a distempered dream.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_.                         What is it<br/>That thou dost see, or think thou look'st upon?<br/><br/>_Man_. Myself, and thee--a peasant of the Alps--<br/>Thy humble virtues, hospitable home,<br/>And spirit patient, pious, proud, and free;<br/>Thy self-respect, grafted on innocent thoughts;<br/>Thy days of health, and nights of sleep; thy toils,<br/>By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes<br/>Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,<br/>With cross and garland over its green turf,<br/>And thy grandchildren's love for epitaph!<br/>This do I see--and then I look within--<br/>It matters not--my Soul was scorched already!<br/><br/>_C. Hun_. And would'st thou then exchange thy lot for mine?<br/><br/>_Man_. No, friend! I would not wrong thee, nor exchange<br/>My lot with living being: I can bear--<br/>However wretchedly, 'tis still to bear--<br/>In life what others could not brook to dream,<br/>But perish in their slumber.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_.                    And with this--<br/>This cautious feeling for another's pain,<br/>Canst thou be black with evil?--say not so.<br/>Can one of gentle thoughts have wreaked revenge<br/>Upon his enemies?<br/><br/>_Man_.             Oh! no, no, no!<br/>My injuries came down on those who loved me--<br/>On those whom I best loved: I never quelled<br/>An enemy, save in my just defence--<br/>But my embrace was fatal.<br/><br/>_C. Hun_.                Heaven give thee rest!<br/>And Penitence restore thee to thyself;<br/>My prayers shall be for thee.<br/><br/>_Man_.                        I need them not,<br/>But can endure thy pity. I depart--<br/>'Tis time--farewell!--Here's gold, and thanks for thee--<br/>No words--it is thy due.--Follow me not--<br/>I know my path--the mountain peril's past:<br/>And once again I charge thee, follow not!<br/>                                                      [_Exit_ MANFRED.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_A lower Valley in the Alps.--A Cataract_.<br/><br/>                         _Enter_ MANFRED.<br/><br/>It is not noon--the Sunbow's rays still arch<br/>The torrent with the many hues of heaven,<br/>And roll the sheeted silver's waving column<br/>O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular,<br/>And fling its lines of foaming light along,<br/>And to and fro, like the pale courser's tail,<br/>The Giant steed, to be bestrode by Death,<br/>As told in the Apocalypse.

And then I dived,<br/>In my lone wanderings, to the caves of Death,<br/>Searching its cause in its effect; and drew<br/>From withered bones, and skulls, and heaped up dust<br/>Conclusions most forbidden.

It may be<br/>That I can aid thee.<br/><br/>_Man_.               To do this thy power<br/>Must wake the dead, or lay me low with them.<br/>Do so--in any shape--in any hour--<br/>With any torture--so it be the last.<br/><br/>_Witch_.

There is a calm upon me--<br/>Inexplicable stillness! which till now<br/>Did not belong to what I knew of life.<br/>If that I did not know Philosophy<br/>To be of all our vanities the motliest,<br/>The merest word that ever fooled the ear<br/>From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem<br/>The golden secret, the sought "Kalon," found,<br/>And seated in my soul. It will not last,<br/>But it is well to have known it, though but once:<br/>It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,<br/>And I within my tablets would note down<br/>That there is such a feeling. Who is there?<br/><br/>                        _Re-enter_ HERMAN.<br/><br/>_Her_. My Lord, the Abbot of St. Maurice craves<br/>To greet your presence.<br/><br/>                _Enter the_ ABBOT OF ST. MAURICE.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.                 Peace be with Count Manfred!<br/><br/>_Man_. Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;<br/>Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those<br/>Who dwell within them.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.              Would it were so, Count!--<br/>But I would fain confer with thee alone.<br/><br/>_Man_. Herman, retire.--What would my reverend guest?<br/><br/>_Abbot_. Thus, without prelude:--Age and zeal--my office--<br/>And good intent must plead my privilege;<br/>Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,<br/>May also be my herald. Rumours strange,<br/>And of unholy nature, are abroad,<br/>And busy with thy name--a noble name<br/>For centuries: may he who bears it now<br/>Transmit it unimpaired!<br/><br/>_Man_.                  Proceed,--I listen.<br/><br/>_Abbot_. 'Tis said thou holdest converse with the things<br/>Which are forbidden to the search of man;<br/>That with the dwellers of the dark abodes,<br/>The many evil and unheavenly spirits<br/>Which walk the valley of the Shade of Death,<br/>Thou communest. I know that with mankind,<br/>Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely<br/>Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude<br/>Is as an Anchorite's--were it but holy.<br/><br/>_Man_. And what are they who do avouch these things?<br/><br/>_Abbot_. My pious brethren--the scar√©d peasantry--<br/>Even thy own vassals--who do look on thee<br/>With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril!<br/><br/>_Man_. Take it.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.        I come to save, and not destroy:<br/>I would not pry into thy secret soul;<br/>But if these things be sooth, there still is time<br/>For penitence and pity: reconcile thee<br/>With the true church, and through the church to Heaven.<br/><br/>_Man_. I hear thee. This is my reply--whate'er<br/>I may have been, or am, doth rest between<br/>Heaven and myself--I shall not choose a mortal<br/>To be my mediator--Have I sinned<br/>Against your ordinances? prove and punish!<br/><br/>_Abbot_. My son! I did not speak of punishment,<br/>But penitence and pardon;--with thyself<br/>The choice of such remains--and for the last,<br/>Our institutions and our strong belief<br/>Have given me power to smooth the path from sin<br/>To higher hope and better thoughts; the first<br/>I leave to Heaven,--"Vengeance is mine alone!"<br/>So saith the Lord, and with all humbleness<br/>His servant echoes back the awful word.<br/><br/>_Man_. Old man! there is no power in holy men,<br/>Nor charm in prayer, nor purifying form<br/>Of penitence, nor outward look, nor fast,<br/>Nor agony--nor, greater than all these,<br/>The innate tortures of that deep Despair,<br/>Which is Remorse without the fear of Hell,<br/>But all in all sufficient to itself<br/>Would make a hell of Heaven--can exorcise<br/>From out the unbounded spirit the quick sense<br/>Of its own sins--wrongs--sufferance--and revenge<br/>Upon itself; there is no future pang<br/>Can deal that justice on the self--condemned<br/>He deals on his own soul.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.                 All this is well;<br/>For this will pass away, and be succeeded<br/>By an auspicious hope, which shall look up<br/>With calm assurafice to that blessed place,<br/>Which all who seek may win, whatever be<br/>Their earthly errors, so they be atoned:<br/>And the commencement of atonement is<br/>The sense of its necessity. Say on--<br/>And all our church can teach thee shall be taught;<br/>And all we can absolve thee shall be pardoned.<br/><br/>_Man_. When Rome's sixth Emperor was near his last,<br/>The victim of a self-inflicted wound,<br/>To shun the torments of a public death<br/>From senates once his slaves, a certain soldier,<br/>With show of loyal pity, would have stanched<br/>The gushing throat with his officious robe;<br/>The dying Roman thrust him back, and said--<br/>Some empire still in his expiring glance--<br/>"It is too late--is this fidelity?"<br/><br/>_Abbot_. And what of this?<br/><br/>_Man_.                     I answer with the Roman--<br/>"It is too late!"<br/><br/>_Abbot_.           It never can be so,<br/>To reconcile thyself with thy own soul,<br/>And thy own soul with Heaven. Hast thou no hope?<br/>'Tis strange--even those who do despair above,<br/>Yet shape themselves some fantasy on earth,<br/>To which frail twig they cling, like drowning men.<br/><br/>_Man_. Aye--father! I have had those early visions,<br/>And noble aspirations in my youth,<br/>To make my own the mind of other men,<br/>The enlightener of nations; and to rise<br/>I knew not whither--it might be to fall;<br/>But fall, even as the mountain-cataract,<br/>Which having leapt from its more dazzling height,<br/>Even in the foaming strength of its abyss,<br/>(Which casts up misty columns that become<br/>Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies,)<br/>Lies low but mighty still.--But this is past,<br/>My thoughts mistook themselves.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.                         And wherefore so?<br/><br/>_Man_.I could not tame my nature down; for he<br/>Must serve who fain would sway; and soothe, and sue,<br/>And watch all time, and pry into all place,<br/>And be a living Lie, who would become<br/>A mighty thing amongst the mean--and such<br/>The mass are; I disdained to mingle with<br/>A herd, though to be leader--and of wolves,<br/>The lion is alone, and so am I.<br/><br/>_Abbot_. And why not live and act with other men?<br/><br/>_Man_. Because my nature was averse from life;<br/>And yet not cruel; for I would not make,<br/>But find a desolation. Like the Wind,<br/>The red-hot breath of the most lone Simoom,<br/>Which dwells but in the desert, and sweeps o'er<br/>The barren sands which bear no shrubs to blast,<br/>And revels o'er their wild and arid waves,<br/>And seeketh not, so that it is not sought,<br/>But being met is deadly,--such hath been<br/>The course of my existence; but there came<br/>Things in my path which are no more.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.                             Alas!<br/>I 'gin to fear that thou art past all aid<br/>From me and from my calling; yet so young,<br/>I still would----<br/><br/>_Man_.              Look on me! there is an order<br/>Of mortals on the earth, who do become<br/>Old in their youth, and die ere middle age,<br/>Without the violence of warlike death;<br/>Some perishing of pleasure--some of study--<br/>Some worn with toil, some of mere weariness,--<br/>Some of disease--and some insanity--<br/>And some of withered, or of broken hearts;<br/>For this last is a malady which slays<br/>More than are numbered in the lists of Fate,<br/>Taking all shapes, and bearing many names.<br/>Look upon me! for even of all these things<br/>Have I partaken; and of all these things,<br/>One were enough; then wonder not that I<br/>Am what I am, but that I ever was,<br/>Or having been, that I am still on earth.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.

Pronounce--what is thy mission?<br/><br/>_Spirit_.                                     Come!<br/><br/>_Abbot_. What art thou, unknown being? answer!--speak!<br/><br/>_Spirit_. The genius of this mortal.--Come!'tis time.<br/><br/>_Man_. I am prepared for all things, but deny<br/>The Power which summons me. Who sent thee here?<br/><br/>_Spirit_. Thou'lt know anon--Come! come!<br/><br/>_Man_.                                  I have commanded<br/>Things of an essence greater far than thine,<br/>And striven with thy masters. Get thee hence!<br/><br/>_Spirit_. Mortal! thine hour is come--Away! I say.<br/><br/>_Man_. I knew, and know my hour is come, but not<br/>To render up my soul to such as thee:<br/>Away! I'll die as I have lived--alone.<br/><br/>_Spirit_. Then I must summon up my brethren.--Rise!<br/>                                                [_Other Spirits rise._<br/><br/>_Abbot_. Avaunt! ye evil ones!--Avaunt! I say,--<br/>Ye have no power where Piety hath power,<br/>And I do charge ye in the name--<br/><br/>_Spirit_.                        Old man!<br/>We know ourselves, our mission, and thine order;<br/>Waste not thy holy words on idle uses,<br/>It were in vain: this man is forfeited.<br/>Once more--I summon him--Away! Away!<br/><br/>_Man_. I do defy ye,--though I feel my soul<br/>Is ebbing from me, yet I do defy ye;<br/>Nor will I hence, while I have earthly breath<br/>To breathe my scorn upon ye--earthly strength<br/>To wrestle, though with spirits; what ye take<br/>Shall be ta'en limb by limb.<br/><br/>_Spirit_.                    Reluctant mortal!<br/>Is this the Magian who would so pervade<br/>The world invisible, and make himself<br/>Almost our equal? Can it be that thou<br/>Art thus in love with life? the very life<br/>Which made thee wretched?<br/><br/>_Man_.                   Thou false fiend, thou liest!<br/>My life is in its last hour,--_that_ I know,<br/>Nor would redeem a moment of that hour;<br/>I do not combat against Death, but thee<br/>And thy surrounding angels; my past power<br/>Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,<br/>But by superior science--penance, daring,<br/>And length of watching, strength of mind, and skill<br/>In knowledge of our Fathers--when the earth<br/>Saw men and spirits walking side by side,<br/>And gave ye no supremacy: I stand<br/>Upon my strength--I do defy--deny--<br/>Spurn back, and scorn ye!--<br/><br/>_Spirit_.                 But thy many crimes<br/>Have made thee--<br/><br/>_Man_.          What are they to such as thee?<br/>Must crimes be punished but by other crimes,<br/>And greater criminals?--Back to thy hell!<br/>Thou hast no power upon me, _that_ I feel;<br/>Thou never shalt possess me, _that_ I know:<br/>What I have done is done; I bear within<br/>A torture which could nothing gain from thine:<br/>The Mind which is immortal makes itself<br/>Requital for its good or evil thoughts,--<br/>Is its own origin of ill and end--<br/>And its own place and time: its innate sense,<br/>When stripped of this mortality, derives<br/>No colour from the fleeting things without,<br/>But is absorbed in sufferance or in joy,<br/>Born from the knowledge of its own desert.<br/>_Thou_ didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me;<br/>I have not been thy dupe, nor am thy prey--<br/>But was my own destroyer, and will be<br/>My own hereafter.--Back, ye baffled fiends!<br/>The hand of Death is on me--but not yours!<br/>                                              [_The Demons disappear._<br/><br/>_Abbot_. Alas! how pale thou art--thy lips are white--<br/>And thy breast heaves--and in thy gasping throat<br/>The accents rattle: Give thy prayers to Heaven--<br/>Pray--albeit but in thought,--but die not thus.<br/><br/>_Man_. 'Tis over--my dull eyes can fix thee not;<br/>But all things swim around me, and the earth<br/>Heaves as it were beneath me. Fare thee well--<br/>Give me thy hand.<br/><br/>_Abbot_.            Cold--cold--even to the heart--<br/>But yet one prayer--Alas! how fares it with thee?<br/><br/>_Man_. Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die.<br/>                                                   [MANFRED _expires._<br/><br/>_Abbot_. He's gone--his soul hath ta'en its earthless flight;<br/>Whither? I dread to think--but he is gone.
