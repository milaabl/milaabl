  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Spring Offensive by *Wilfred Owen*

<p>
    Halted against the shade of a last hill,<br/>They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease<br/>And, finding comfortable chests and knees<br/>Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still<br/>To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,<br/>Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.<br/><br/>Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled<br/>By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,<br/>For though the summer oozed into their veins<br/>Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,<br/>Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,<br/>Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.<br/><br/>Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --<br/>And the far valley behind, where the buttercups<br/>Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,<br/>Where even the little brambles would not yield,<br/>But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;<br/>They breathe like trees unstirred.<br/><br/>Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word<br/>At which each body and its soul begird<br/>And tighten them for battle.  No alarms<br/>Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --<br/>Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced<br/>The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.<br/>O larger shone that smile against the sun, --<br/>Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.<br/><br/>So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together<br/>Over an open stretch of herb and heather<br/>Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned<br/>With fury against them; and soft sudden cups<br/>Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes<br/>Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.<br/><br/>Of them who running on that last high place<br/>Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up<br/>On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,<br/>Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,<br/>Some say God caught them even before they fell.<br/><br/>But what say such as from existence' brink<br/>Ventured but drave too swift to sink.<br/>The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,<br/>And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames<br/>With superhuman inhumanities,<br/>Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --<br/>And crawling slowly back, have by degrees<br/>Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --<br/>Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
</p>
