# üíÆ The Water-Fall by *Henry Vaughan*

<p>
    1 With what deep murmurs through time's silent stealth<br/>2 Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat'ry wealth<br/>3 Here flowing fall,<br/>4 And chide, and call,<br/>5 As if his liquid, loose retinue stay'd<br/>6 Ling'ring, and were of this steep place afraid;<br/>7 The common pass<br/>8 Where, clear as glass,<br/>9 All must descend<br/>10 Not to an end,<br/>11 But quicken'd by this deep and rocky grave,<br/>12 Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.<br/><br/>13 Dear stream! dear bank, where often I<br/>14 Have sate and pleas'd my pensive eye,<br/>15 Why, since each drop of thy quick store<br/>16 Runs thither whence it flow'd before,<br/>17 Should poor souls fear a shade or night,<br/>18 Who came, sure, from a sea of light?<br/>19 Or since those drops are all sent back<br/>20 So sure to thee, that none doth lack,<br/>21 Why should frail flesh doubt any more<br/>22 That what God takes, he'll not restore?<br/><br/>23 O useful element and clear!<br/>24 My sacred wash and cleanser here,<br/>25 My first consigner unto those<br/>26 Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!<br/>27 What sublime truths and wholesome themes<br/>28 Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!<br/>29 Such as dull man can never find<br/>30 Unless that Spirit lead his mind<br/>31 Which first upon thy face did move,<br/>32 And hatch'd all with his quick'ning love.<br/>33 As this loud brook's incessant fall<br/>34 In streaming rings restagnates all,<br/>35 Which reach by course the bank, and then<br/>36 Are no more seen, just so pass men.<br/>37 O my invisible estate,<br/>38 My glorious liberty, still late!<br/>39 Thou art the channel my soul seeks,<br/>40 Not this with cataracts and creeks.
