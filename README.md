# üíÆ An Essay on Man by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    EPISTLE I.<br/><br/>OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO THE UNIVERSE.<br/><br/>AWAKE, my St John! leave all meaner things<br/>To low ambition, and the pride of kings.<br/>Let us (since life can little more supply<br/>Than just to look about us and to die)<br/>Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man;<br/>A mighty maze! but not without a plan;<br/>A wild, where weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot;<br/>Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.<br/>Together let us beat this ample field,<br/>Try what the open, what the covert yield;<br/>The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore<br/>Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;<br/>Eye Nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,<br/>And catch the manners living as they rise;<br/>Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;<br/>But vindicate the ways of God to Man.<br/><br/>I. Say first, of God above, or Man below,<br/>What can we reason, but from what we know?<br/>Of Man, what see we but his station here,<br/>From which to reason, or to which refer?<br/>Through worlds unnumber'd, though the God be known,<br/>'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.<br/>He who through vast immensity can pierce,<br/>See worlds on worlds compose one universe,<br/>Observe how system into system runs,<br/>What other planets circle other suns,<br/>What varied being peoples every star,<br/>May tell why Heaven has made us as we are.<br/>But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,<br/>The strong connexions, nice dependencies,<br/>Gradations just, has thy pervading soul<br/>Look'd through? or can a part contain the whole?<br/><br/>Is the great chain, that draws all to agree,<br/>And drawn, supports, upheld by God, or thee?<br/><br/>II. Presumptuous Man! the reason wouldst thou find,<br/>Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?<br/>First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,<br/>Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less?<br/>Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made<br/>Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade?<br/>Or ask of yonder argent fields above,<br/>Why Jove's satellites are less than Jove?<br/><br/>Of systems possible, if 'tis confess'd<br/>That Wisdom infinite must form the best,<br/>Where all must full or not coherent be,<br/>And all that rises, rise in due degree;<br/>Then, in the scale of reasoning life, 'tis plain,<br/>There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man:<br/>And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)<br/>Is only this, if God has placed him wrong?<br/><br/>Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,<br/>May, must be right, as relative to all.<br/>In human works, though labour'd on with pain,<br/>A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;<br/>In God's, one single can its end produce;<br/>Yet serves to second, too, some other use.<br/>So Man, who here seems principal alone,<br/>Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,<br/>Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;<br/>'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.<br/><br/>When the proud steed shall know why Man restrains<br/>His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains;<br/>When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod,<br/>Is now a victim, and now Egypt's god:<br/>Then shall man's pride and dulness comprehend<br/>His actions', passions', being's use and end;<br/>Why doing, suffering, check'd, impell'd; and why<br/>This hour a slave, the next a deity.<br/><br/>Then say not Man's imperfect, Heaven in fault;<br/>Say rather, Man's as perfect as he ought:<br/>His knowledge measured to his state and place;<br/>His time a moment, and a point his space.<br/>If to be perfect in a certain sphere,<br/>What matter, soon or late, or here or there?<br/>The blest to-day is as completely so,<br/>As who began a thousand years ago.<br/><br/>III. Heaven from all creatures hides the book of Fate,<br/>All but the page prescribed, their present state:<br/>From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:<br/>Or who could suffer being here below?<br/>The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,<br/>Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?<br/>Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food,<br/>And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood.<br/>Oh blindness to the future! kindly given,<br/>That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heaven:<br/>Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,<br/>A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,<br/>Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,<br/>And now a bubble burst, and now a world.<br/><br/>Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;<br/>Wait the great teacher, Death; and God adore.<br/>What future bliss, He gives not thee to know,<br/>But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.<br/>Hope springs eternal in the human breast:<br/>Man never Is, but always To be blest:<br/>The soul, uneasy and confined from home,<br/>Rests and expatiates in a life to come.<br/><br/>Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind<br/>Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;<br/>His soul, proud science never taught to stray<br/>Far as the solar walk, or milky-way;<br/>Yet simple nature to his hope has given,<br/>Behind the cloud-topp'd hill, an humbler heaven;<br/>Some safer world in depth of woods embraced,<br/>Some happier island in the watery waste,<br/>Where slaves once more their native land behold,<br/>No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.<br/>To be, contents his natural desire,<br/>He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;<br/>But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,<br/>His faithful dog shall bear him company.<br/><br/>IV. Go, wiser thou! and in thy scale of sense,<br/>Weigh thy opinion against Providence;<br/>Call imperfection what thou fanciest such,<br/>Say, here he gives too little, there too much:<br/>Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust,<br/>Yet cry, If Man's unhappy, God's unjust:<br/>If Man alone engross not Heaven's high care,<br/>Alone made perfect here, immortal there:<br/>Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,<br/>Re-judge his justice, be the God of God.<br/>In pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies;<br/>All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.<br/>Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,<br/>Men would be angels, angels would be gods.<br/>Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell,<br/>Aspiring to be angels, men rebel:<br/>And who but wishes to invert the laws<br/>Of ORDER, sins against the Eternal Cause.<br/><br/>V. Ask for what end the heavenly bodies shine,<br/>Earth for whose use? Pride answers, ''Tis for mine:<br/>For me kind Nature wakes her genial power,<br/>Suckles each herb, and spreads out every flower;<br/>Annual for me the grape, the rose renew,<br/>The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;<br/>For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;<br/>For me, health gushes from a thousand springs;<br/>Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;<br/>My footstool earth, my canopy the skies.'<br/><br/>But errs not Nature from this gracious end,<br/>From burning suns when livid deaths descend,<br/>When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep<br/>Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?<br/>'No' 'tis replied, 'the first Almighty Cause<br/>Acts not by partial, but by general laws;<br/>Th' exceptions few; some change, since all began:<br/>And what created perfect?'--Why then Man?<br/>If the great end be human happiness,<br/>Then Nature deviates; and can Man do less?<br/>As much that end a constant course requires<br/>Of showers and sunshine, as of Man's desires;<br/>As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,<br/>As men for ever temperate, calm, and wise.<br/>If plagues or earthquakes break not Heaven's design,<br/>Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline?<br/>Who knows but He, whose hand the lightning forms,<br/>Who heaves old Ocean, and who wings the storms,<br/>Pours fierce ambition in a Caesar's mind,<br/>Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?<br/>From pride, from pride, our very reasoning springs;<br/>Account for moral, as for natural things:<br/>Why charge we Heaven in those, in these acquit?<br/>In both, to reason right, is to submit.<br/><br/>Better for us, perhaps, it might appear,<br/>Were there all harmony, all virtue here;<br/>That never air or ocean felt the wind,<br/>That never passion discomposed the mind.<br/>But all subsists by elemental strife;<br/>And passions are the elements of life.<br/>The general order, since the whole began,<br/>Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man.<br/><br/>VI. What would this Man? Now upward will he soar,<br/>And, little less than angel, would be more;<br/>Now looking downwards, just as grieved appears<br/>To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.<br/>Made for his use all creatures if he call,<br/>Say, what their use, had he the powers of all?<br/>Nature to these, without profusion, kind,<br/>The proper organs, proper powers assign'd;<br/>Each seeming want compensated, of course,<br/>Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;<br/>All in exact proportion to the state;<br/>Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.<br/>Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:<br/>Is Heaven unkind to Man, and Man alone?<br/>Shall he alone, whom rational we call,<br/>Be pleased with nothing, if not bless'd with all?<br/><br/>The bliss of Man (could pride that blessing find)<br/>Is not to act or think beyond mankind;<br/>No powers of body or of soul to share,<br/>But what his nature and his state can bear.<br/>Why has not Man a microscopic eye?<br/>For this plain reason, Man is not a fly.<br/>Say, what the use, were finer optics given,<br/>T'inspect a mite, not comprehend the heaven?<br/>Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,<br/>To smart and agonise at every pore?<br/>Or, quick effluvia darting through the brain,<br/>Die of a rose in aromatic pain?<br/>If nature thunder'd in his opening ears,<br/>And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres,<br/>How would he wish that Heaven had left him still<br/>The whispering zephyr, and the purling rill?<br/>Who finds not Providence all good and wise,<br/>Alike in what it gives, and what denies?<br/><br/>VII. Far as Creation's ample range extends,<br/>The scale of sensual, mental powers ascends:<br/>Mark how it mounts, to Man's imperial race,<br/>From the green myriads in the peopled grass:<br/>What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,<br/>The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam!<br/>Of smell, the headlong lioness between,<br/>And hound sagacious on the tainted green:<br/>Of hearing, from the life that fills the flood,<br/>To that which warbles through the vernal wood:<br/>The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!<br/>Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:<br/>In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true<br/>From poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew!<br/>How instinct varies in the grovelling swine,<br/>Compared, half-reasoning elephant, with thine!<br/>'Twixt that and reason, what a nice barrier:<br/>For ever separate, yet for ever near!<br/>Remembrance and reflection how allied;<br/>What thin partitions sense from thought divide:<br/>And middle natures, how they long to join,<br/>Yet never pass th' insuperable line!<br/>Without this just gradation, could they be<br/>Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?<br/>The powers of all subdued by thee alone,<br/>Is not thy reason all these powers in one?<br/><br/>VIII. See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth,<br/>All matter quick, and bursting into birth:<br/>Above, how high progressive life may go!<br/>Around, how wide! how deep extend below!<br/>Vast chain of being! which from God began,<br/>Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,<br/>Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,<br/>No glass can reach; from Infinite to Thee,<br/>From Thee to Nothing.--On superior powers<br/>Were we to press, inferior might on ours:<br/>Or in the full creation leave a void,<br/>Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd:<br/>From Nature's chain whatever link you strike,<br/>Tenth, or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.<br/><br/>And, if each system in gradation roll<br/>Alike essential to th' amazing whole,<br/>The least confusion but in one, not all<br/>That system only, but the whole must fall.<br/>Let earth, unbalanced, from her orbit fly,<br/>Planets and suns run lawless through the sky;<br/>Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurl'd,<br/>Being on being wreck'd, and world on world;<br/>Heaven's whole foundations to their centre nod,<br/>And Nature trembles to the throne of God.<br/>All this dread order break--for whom? for thee?<br/>Vile worm!--oh madness! pride! impiety!<br/><br/>IX. What if the foot, ordain'd the dust to tread,<br/>Or hand, to toil, aspired to be the head<br/>What if the head, the eye, or ear repined<br/>To serve mere engines to the ruling mind?<br/>Just as absurd for any part to claim<br/>To be another, in this general frame;<br/>Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,<br/>The great directing Mind of All ordains.<br/><br/>All are but parts of one stupendous whole,<br/>Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;<br/>That, changed through all, and yet in all the same;<br/>Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame:<br/>Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,<br/>Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,<br/>Lives through all life, extends through all extent.<br/>Spreads undivided, operates unspent;<br/>Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,<br/>As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;<br/>As full, as perfect, in vile Man that mourns,<br/>As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns:<br/>To Him no high, no low, no great, no small;<br/>He fills, He bounds, connects, and equals all.<br/><br/>X. Cease then, nor Order imperfection name:<br/>Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.<br/>Know thy own point: this kind, this due degree<br/>Of blindness, weakness, Heaven bestows on thee.<br/>Submit--in this, or any other sphere,<br/>Secure to be as bless'd as thou canst bear:<br/>Safe in the hand of one disposing Power,<br/>Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.<br/>All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee;<br/>All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;<br/>All discord, harmony not understood;<br/>All partial evil, universal good:<br/>And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite,<br/>One truth is clear, WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT.<br/><br/>EPISTLE II.<br/><br/>OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO HIMSELF AS AN INDIVIDUAL.<br/><br/>I. KNOW then thyself, presume not God to scan;<br/>The proper study of mankind is Man.<br/>Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,<br/>A being darkly wise, and rudely great:<br/>With too much knowledge for the sceptic side,<br/>With too much weakness for the stoic's pride,<br/>He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;<br/>In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast;<br/>In doubt his mind or body to prefer;<br/>Born but to die, and reasoning but to err;<br/>Alike in ignorance, his reason such,<br/>Whether he thinks too little, or too much:<br/>Chaos of thought and passion, all confused;<br/>Still by himself abused, or disabused;<br/>Created half to rise, and half to fall;<br/>Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;<br/>Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd:<br/>The glory, jest, and riddle of the world!<br/><br/>Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides,<br/>Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;<br/>Instruct the planets in what orbs to run,<br/>Correct old Time, and regulate the sun;<br/>Go, soar with Plato to the empyreal sphere,<br/>To the first Good, first Perfect, and first Fair;<br/>Or tread the mazy round his followers trod,<br/>And quitting sense call imitating God;<br/>As eastern priests in giddy circles run,<br/>And turn their heads to imitate the sun.<br/>Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule--<br/>Then drop into thyself, and be a fool!<br/><br/>Superior beings, when of late they saw<br/>A mortal man unfold all Nature's law,<br/>Admired such wisdom in an earthly shape,<br/>And show'd a Newton as we show an ape.<br/><br/>Could he, whose rules the rapid comet bind,<br/>Describe or fix one movement of his mind?<br/>Who saw its fires here rise, and there descend,<br/>Explain his own beginning, or his end?<br/>Alas, what wonder! Man's superior part<br/>Uncheck'd may rise, and climb from art to art;<br/>But when his own great work is but begun,<br/>What reason weaves, by passion is undone.<br/><br/>Trace Science, then, with modesty thy guide;<br/>First strip off all her equipage of pride;<br/>Deduct what is but vanity, or dress,<br/>Or learning's luxury, or idleness;<br/>Or tricks to show the stretch of human brain.<br/>Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain;<br/>Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent parts<br/>Of all our vices have created arts;<br/>Then see how little the remaining sum,<br/>Which served the past, and must the times to come!<br/><br/>II. Two principles in human nature reign--<br/>Self-love, to urge, and reason, to restrain;<br/>Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call,<br/>Each works its end, to move or govern all:<br/>And to their proper operation still,<br/>Ascribe all good; to their improper, ill.<br/><br/>Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;<br/>Reason's comparing balance rules the whole.<br/>Man, but for that, no action could attend,<br/>And, but for this, were active to no end:<br/>Fix'd like a plant on his peculiar spot,<br/>To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot;<br/>Or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void,<br/>Destroying others, by himself destroy'd.<br/><br/>Most strength the moving principle requires;<br/>Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires.<br/>Sedate and quiet the comparing lies,<br/>Form'd but to check, deliberate, and advise.<br/>Self-love, still stronger, as its objects nigh;<br/>Reason's at distance, and in prospect lie:<br/>That sees immediate good by present sense;<br/>Reason, the future and the consequence.<br/>Thicker than arguments, temptations throng,<br/>At best more watchful this, but that more strong.<br/>The action of the stronger to suspend<br/>Reason still use, to reason still attend.<br/>Attention, habit and experience gains;<br/>Each strengthens reason, and self-love restrains.<br/><br/>Let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight,<br/>More studious to divide than to unite;<br/>And grace and virtue, sense and reason split,<br/>With all the rash dexterity of wit.<br/>Wits, just like fools, at war about a name,<br/>Have full as oft no meaning, or the same.<br/>Self-love and reason to one end aspire,<br/>Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire;<br/>But greedy that its object would devour,<br/>This taste the honey, and not wound the flower:<br/>Pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood,<br/>Our greatest evil, or our greatest good.<br/><br/>III. Modes of self-love the passions we may call:<br/>'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all:<br/>But since not every good we can divide,<br/>And reason bids us for our own provide;<br/>Passions, though selfish, if their means be fair,<br/>List under reason, and deserve her care;<br/>Those, that imparted, court a nobler aim,<br/>Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name.<br/><br/>In lazy apathy let Stoics boast<br/>Their virtue fix'd; 'tis fix'd as in a frost;<br/>Contracted all, retiring to the breast;<br/>But strength of mind is exercise, not rest:<br/>The rising tempest puts in act the soul,<br/>Parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole.<br/>On life's vast ocean diversely we sail,<br/>Reason the card, but passion is the gale;<br/>Nor God alone in the still calm we find,<br/>He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.<br/><br/>Passions, like elements, though born to fight,<br/>Yet, mix'd and soften'd, in his work unite:<br/>These 'tis enough to temper and employ;<br/>But what composes Man, can Man destroy?<br/>Suffice that reason keep to Nature's road;<br/>Subject, compound them, follow her and God.<br/>Love, Hope, and Joy, fair Pleasure's smiling train,<br/>Hate, Fear, and Grief, the family of Pain,<br/>These mix'd with art, and to due bounds confined,<br/>Make and maintain the balance of the mind:<br/>The lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife<br/>Gives all the strength and colour of our life.<br/><br/>Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes;<br/>And when, in act, they cease, in prospect, rise:<br/>Present to grasp, and future still to find,<br/>The whole employ of body and of mind.<br/>All spread their charms, but charm not all alike;<br/>On different senses different objects strike;<br/>Hence different passions more or less inflame,<br/>As strong or weak, the organs of the frame;<br/>And hence one master passion in the breast,<br/>Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest.<br/>As Man, perhaps, the moment of his breath,<br/>Receives the lurking principle of death;<br/>The young disease, that must subdue at length,<br/>Grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength:<br/>So, cast and mingled with his very frame,<br/>The mind's disease, its ruling passion came;<br/>Each vital humour which should feed the whole,<br/>Soon flows to this, in body and in soul:<br/>Whatever warms the heart, or fills the head,<br/>As the mind opens, and its functions spread,<br/>Imagination plies her dangerous art,<br/>And pours it all upon the peccant part.<br/><br/>Nature its mother, habit is its nurse;<br/>Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse;<br/>Reason itself but gives it edge and power;<br/>As Heaven's blest beam turns vinegar more sour.<br/><br/>We, wretched subjects, though to lawful sway,<br/>In this weak queen, some favourite still obey:<br/>Ah!

Nor think, in Nature's state they blindly trod;<br/>The state of Nature was the reign of God:<br/>Self-love and social at her birth began,<br/>Union the bond of all things, and of Man.<br/>Pride then was not; nor arts, that pride to aid;<br/>Man walk'd with beast, joint tenant of the shade;<br/>The same his table, and the same his bed;<br/>No murder clothed him, and no murder fed.<br/>In the same temple, the resounding wood,<br/>All vocal beings hymn'd their equal God:<br/>The shrine with gore unstain'd, with gold undress'd,<br/>Unbribed, unbloody, stood the blameless priest:<br/>Heaven's attribute was universal care,<br/>And Man's prerogative to rule, but spare.<br/>Ah! how unlike the Man of times to come!<br/>Of half that live the butcher and the tomb;<br/>Who, foe to Nature, hears the general groan,<br/>Murders their species, and betrays his own.<br/>But just disease to luxury succeeds,<br/>And every death its own avenger breeds;<br/>The fury-passions from that blood began,<br/>And turn'd on Man, a fiercer savage, Man.<br/><br/>See him from Nature rising slow to Art!<br/>To copy instinct then was reason's part;<br/>Thus then to Man the voice of Nature spake--<br/>'Go, from the creatures thy instructions take:<br/>Learn from the birds what food the thickets yield;<br/>Learn from the beasts the physic of the field;<br/>Thy arts of building from the bee receive;<br/>Learn of the mole to plough, the worm to weave;<br/>Learn of the little nautilus to sail,<br/>Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale.<br/>Here, too, all forms of social union find,<br/>And hence let reason, late, instruct mankind:<br/>Here subterranean works and cities see;<br/>There towns a√´rial on the waving tree.<br/>Learn each small people's genius, policies,<br/>The ants' republic, and the realm of bees;<br/>How those in common all their wealth bestow,<br/>And anarchy without confusion know;<br/>And these for ever, though a monarch reign,<br/>Their separate cells and properties maintain.<br/>Mark what unvaried laws preserve each state,<br/>Laws wise as Nature, and as fix'd as Fate.<br/>In vain thy reason finer webs shall draw,<br/>Entangle Justice in her net of lay,<br/>And right, too rigid, harden into wrong;<br/>Still for the strong too weak, the weak too strong.<br/>Yet go! and thus o'er all the creatures sway,<br/>Thus let the wiser make the rest obey;<br/>And for those arts mere instinct could afford,<br/>Be crown'd as monarchs, or as gods adored.'<br/><br/>V. Great Nature spoke; observant men obey'd;<br/>Cities were built, societies were made:<br/>Here rose one little state; another near<br/>Grew by like means, and join'd, through love or fear.<br/>Did here the trees with ruddier burdens bend,<br/>And there the streams in purer rills descend?<br/>What war could ravish, commerce could bestow;<br/>And he return'd a friend, who came a foe.<br/>Converse and love mankind might strongly draw,<br/>When love was liberty, and Nature law.<br/>Thus states were form'd, the name of king unknown,<br/>Till common interest placed the sway in one.<br/>'Twas virtue only (or in arts or arms,<br/>Diffusing blessings or averting harms),<br/>The same which in a sire the sons obey'd,<br/>A prince the father of a people made.<br/><br/>VI.

strengthen, not invade;<br/>More powerful each as needful to the rest,<br/>And in proportion as it blesses, bless'd;<br/>Draw to one point, and to one centre bring<br/>Beast, man, or angel, servant, lord, or king.<br/><br/>For forms of government let fools contest;<br/>Whate'er is best administer'd is best:<br/>For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;<br/>His can't be wrong whose life is in the right:<br/>In faith and hope the world will disagree,<br/>But all mankind's concern is charity:<br/>All must be false that thwart this one great end;<br/>And all of God that bless mankind, or mend.<br/><br/>Man, like the generous vine, supported lives;<br/>The strength he gains is from the embrace he gives.<br/>On their own axis as the planets run,<br/>Yet make at once their circle round the sun;<br/>So two consistent motions act the soul,<br/>And one regards itself, and one the whole.<br/><br/>Thus God and Nature link'd the general frame,<br/>And bade self-love and social be the same.<br/><br/>EPISTLE IV.<br/><br/>OF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN WITH RESPECT TO HAPPINESS.<br/><br/>O Happiness! our being's end and aim!<br/>Good, Pleasure, Ease, Content! whate'er thy name:<br/>That something still which prompts th' eternal sigh,<br/>For which we bear to live, or dare to die,<br/>Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies,<br/>O'erlook'd, seen double, by the fool, and wise.<br/>Plant of celestial seed! if dropp'd below,<br/>Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?<br/>Fair opening to some court's propitious shine,<br/>Or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine?<br/>Twined with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,<br/>Or reap'd in iron harvests of the field?<br/>Where grows?--where grows it not?

What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy,<br/>The soul's calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy,<br/>Is virtue's prize: a better would you fix?<br/>Then give humility a coach and six,<br/>Justice a conqueror's sword, or truth a gown,<br/>Or public spirit its great cure, a crown.<br/>Weak, foolish man! will Heaven reward us there<br/>With the same trash mad mortals wish for here?<br/>The boy and man an individual makes,<br/>Yet sigh'st thou now for apples and for cakes?<br/>Go, like the Indian, in another life<br/>Expect thy dog, thy bottle, and thy wife;<br/>As well as dream such trifles are assign'd,<br/>As toys and empires, for a godlike mind.<br/>Rewards, that either would to virtue bring<br/>No joy, or be destructive of the thing;<br/>How oft by these at sixty are undone<br/>The virtues of a saint at twenty-one!<br/>To whom can riches give repute, or trust,<br/>Content, or pleasure, but the good and just?<br/>Judges and senates have been bought for gold,<br/>Esteem and love were never to be sold.<br/>O fool! to think God hates the worthy mind,<br/>The lover and the love of human kind,<br/>Whose life is healthful, and whose conscience clear,<br/>Because he wants a thousand pounds a year.<br/><br/>Honour and shame from no condition rise;<br/>Act well your part; there all the honour lies.<br/>Fortune in men has some small difference made--<br/>One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade;<br/>The cobbler apron'd, and the parson gown'd,<br/>The friar hooded, and the monarch crown'd.<br/>'What differ more' (you cry) 'than crown and cowl?'<br/>I'll tell you, friend!--a wise man and a fool.<br/>You'll find, if once the monarch acts the monk,<br/>Or, cobbler-like, the parson will be drunk,<br/>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow;<br/>The rest is all but leather or prunella.<br/><br/>Stuck o'er with titles, and hung round with strings,<br/>That thou may'st be by kings, or whores of kings,<br/>Boast the pure blood of an illustrious race,<br/>In quiet flow from Lucrece to Lucrece:<br/>But by your fathers' worth if yours you rate,<br/>Count me those only who were good and great.<br/>Go! if your ancient but ignoble blood<br/>Has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood,<br/>Go! and pretend your family is young;<br/>Nor own, your fathers have been fools so long.<br/>What can ennoble sots, or slaves, or cowards?<br/>Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards.<br/><br/>Look next on greatness; say where greatness lies?<br/>'Where, but among the heroes and the wise?'<br/>Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed,<br/>From Macedonia's madman to the Swede;<br/>The whole strange purpose of their lives, to find<br/>Or make an enemy of all mankind!<br/>Not one looks backward, onward still he goes,<br/>Yet ne'er looks forward further than his nose.<br/>No less alike the politic and wise;<br/>All sly slow things, with circumspective eyes:<br/>Men in their loose unguarded hours they take,<br/>Not that themselves are wise, but others weak.<br/>But grant that those can conquer, these can cheat;<br/>'Tis phrase absurd to call a villain great:<br/>Who wickedly is wise, or madly brave,<br/>Is but the more a fool, the more a knave.<br/>Who noble ends by noble means obtains,<br/>Or failing, smiles in exile or in chains,<br/>Like good Aurelius let him reign, or bleed<br/>Like Socrates, that man is great indeed.<br/><br/>What's fame? A fancied life in others' breath,<br/>A thing beyond us, even before our death.<br/>Just what you hear, you have; and what's unknown<br/>The same (my Lord) if Tully's, or your own.<br/>All that we feel of it begins and ends<br/>In the small circle of our foes or friends;<br/>To all beside as much an empty shade<br/>An Eugene living, as a C√¶sar dead;<br/>Alike or when, or where, they shone, or shine,<br/>Or on the Rubicon, or on the Rhine.<br/>A wit's a feather, and a chief a rod;<br/>An honest man's the noblest work of God.<br/>Fame but from death a villain's name can save,<br/>As justice tears his body from the grave,<br/>When what t' oblivion better were resign'd,<br/>Is hung on high, to poison half mankind.<br/>All fame is foreign, but of true desert;<br/>Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart:<br/>One self-approving hour whole years out-weighs<br/>Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas;<br/>And more true joy Marcellus exiled feels,<br/>Than C√¶sar with a senate at his heels.<br/><br/>In parts superior what advantage lies?<br/>Tell (for you can) what is it to be wise?<br/>'Tis but to know how little can be known;<br/>To see all others' faults, and feel our own:<br/>Condemn'd in business or in arts to drudge,<br/>Without a second, or without a judge.<br/>Truths would you teach, or save a sinking land?<br/>All fear, none aid you, and few understand.<br/>Painful pre-eminence! yourself to view<br/>Above life's weakness, and its comforts too.<br/><br/>Bring then these blessings to a strict account;<br/>Make fair deductions; see to what they mount:<br/>How much of other each is sure to cost;<br/>How each for other oft is wholly lost;<br/>How inconsistent greater goods with these;<br/>How sometimes life is risk'd, and always ease:<br/>Think, and if still the things thy envy call,<br/>Say, wouldst thou be the man to whom they fall?<br/>To sigh for ribands if thou art so silly,<br/>Mark how they grace Lord Umbra, or Sir Billy:<br/>Is yellow dirt the passion of thy life?<br/>Look but on Gripus, or on Gripus' wife:<br/>If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shined,<br/>The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind:<br/>Or, ravish'd with the whistling of a name,<br/>See Cromwell, damn'd to everlasting fame!<br/>If all, united, thy ambition call,<br/>From ancient story learn to scorn them all.<br/>There, in the rich, the honour'd, famed, and great,<br/>See the false scale of happiness complete!<br/>In hearts of kings, or arms of queens who lay,<br/>How happy! those to ruin, these betray.<br/>Mark by what wretched steps their glory grows,<br/>From dirt and sea-weed as proud Venice rose;<br/>In each how guilt and greatness equal ran,<br/>And all that raised the hero, sunk the man:<br/>Now Europe's laurels on their brows behold,<br/>But stain'd with blood, or ill exchanged for gold:<br/>Then see them broke with toils, or sunk in ease,<br/>Or infamous for plunder'd provinces.<br/>Oh wealth ill-fated! which no act of fame<br/>E'er taught to shine, or sanctified from shame!<br/>What greater bliss attends their close of life?<br/>Some greedy minion, or imperious wife.<br/>The trophied arches, storied halls invade,<br/>And haunt their slumbers in the pompous shade.<br/>Alas! not dazzled with their noontide ray,<br/>Compute the morn and evening to the day;<br/>The whole amount of that enormous fame,<br/>A tale that blends their glory with their shame!<br/><br/>VII. Know then this truth (enough for man to know)<br/>'Virtue alone is happiness below.'<br/>The only point where human bliss stands still,<br/>And tastes the good without the fall to ill;<br/>Where only merit constant pay receives,<br/>Is bless'd in what it takes, and what it gives;<br/>The joy unequall'd, if its end it gain,<br/>And if it lose, attended with no pain:<br/>Without satiety, though e'er so bless'd,<br/>And but more relish'd as the more distress'd:<br/>The broadest mirth unfeeling Folly wears,<br/>Less pleasing far than Virtue's very tears:<br/>Good, from each object, from each place acquired,<br/>For ever exercised, yet never tired;<br/>Never elated, while one man's oppress'd;<br/>Never dejected, while another's bless'd;<br/>And where no wants, no wishes can remain,<br/>Since but to wish more virtue, is to gain.<br/><br/>See the sole bliss Heaven could on all bestow!<br/>Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know:<br/>Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind,<br/>The bad must miss; the good, untaught, will find;<br/>Slave to no sect, who takes no private road,<br/>But looks through Nature up to Nature's God;<br/>Pursues that chain which links th' immense design,<br/>Joins Heaven and Earth, and mortal and divine;<br/>Sees, that no being any bliss can know,<br/>But touches some above, and some below;<br/>Learns, from this union of the rising whole,<br/>The first, last purpose of the human soul;<br/>And knows where faith, law, morals, all began,<br/>All end, in love of God, and love of Man.<br/><br/>For him alone Hope leads from goal to goal,<br/>And opens still, and opens on his soul;<br/>Till lengthen'd on to Faith, and unconfined,<br/>It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind.<br/>He sees why Nature plants in Man alone<br/>Hope of known bliss, and faith in bliss unknown:<br/>(Nature, whose dictates to no other kind<br/>Are given in vain, but what they seek they find)<br/>Wise is her present; she connects in this<br/>His greatest virtue with his greatest bliss;<br/>At once his own bright prospect to be bless'd,<br/>And strongest motive to assist the rest.<br/><br/>Self-love thus push'd to social, to divine,<br/>Gives thee to make thy neighbour's blessing thine.<br/>Is this too little for the boundless heart?<br/>Extend it, let thy enemies have part;<br/>Grasp the whole worlds of Reason, Life, and Sense,<br/>In one close system of Benevolence:<br/>Happier as kinder, in whate'er degree,<br/>And height of bliss but height of charity.<br/><br/>God loves from whole to parts: but human soul<br/>Must rise from individual to the whole.<br/>Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake,<br/>As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake;<br/>The centre moved, a circle straight succeeds,<br/>Another still, and still another spreads;<br/>Friend, parent, neighbour, first it will embrace;<br/>His country next; and next all human race;<br/>Wide and more wide, th' o'erflowings of the mind<br/>Take every creature in, of every kind;<br/>Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty bless'd,<br/>And Heaven beholds its image in his breast.<br/><br/>Come then, my friend, my genius! come along;<br/>O master of the poet, and the song!<br/>And while the Muse now stoops, or now ascends,<br/>To Man's low passions, or their glorious ends,<br/>Teach me, like thee, in various Nature wise,<br/>To fall with dignity, with temper rise;<br/>Form'd by thy converse, happily to steer<br/>From grave to gay, from lively to severe;<br/>Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease,<br/>Intent to reason, or polite to please.<br/>Oh! while along the stream of Time thy name<br/>Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame,<br/>Say, shall my little bark attendant sail,<br/>Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale?<br/>When statesmen, heroes, kings, in dust repose,<br/>Whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes,<br/>Shall then this verse to future age pretend<br/>Thou wert my guide, philosopher, and friend?<br/>That, urged by thee, I turn'd the tuneful art.<br/>From sounds to things, from fancy to the heart;<br/>For Wit's false mirror held up Nature's light;<br/>Show'd erring pride, Whatever is, is right;<br/>That Reason, Passion, answer one great aim;<br/>That true Self-love and Social are the same;<br/>That Virtue only makes our bliss below;<br/>And all our knowledge is, Ourselves to know.
