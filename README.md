# üíÆ Satire I. to Mr Fortescue. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    SATIRES AND EPISTLES OF HORACE IMITATED.<br/><br/>_P_. There are (I scarce can think it, but am told)<br/>There are, to whom my satire seems too bold:<br/>Scarce to wise Peter complaisant enough,<br/>And something said of Chartres much too rough.<br/>The lines are weak, another's pleased to say,<br/>Lord Fanny spins a thousand such a day.<br/>Timorous by nature, of the rich in awe,<br/>I come to counsel learn√®d in the law:<br/>'You'll give me, like a friend both sage and free,<br/>Advice; and (as you use) without a fee.'<br/><br/>_F_. I'd write no more.<br/><br/>_P_.              Not write? but then I think,<br/>And for my soul I cannot sleep a wink.<br/>I nod in company, I wake at night,<br/>Fools rush into my head, and so I write.<br/><br/>_F_. You could not do a worse thing for your life.<br/>Why, if the nights seem tedious--take a wife:<br/>Or rather truly, if your point be rest,<br/>Lettuce and cowslip-wine; _probatum est_.<br/>But talk with Celsus, Celsus will advise<br/>Hartshorn, or something that shall close your eyes.<br/>Or, if you needs must write, write Caesar's praise,<br/>You'll gain at least a knighthood, or the bays.<br/><br/>_P_. What! like Sir Richard, rumbling, rough, and fierce,<br/>With arms, and George, and Brunswick crowd the verse,<br/>Rend with tremendous sound your ears asunder,<br/>With gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbuss, and thunder?<br/>Or, nobly wild, with Budgell's fire and force,<br/>Paint angels trembling round his falling horse?<br/><br/>_F_. Then all your Muse's softer art display,<br/>Let Carolina smooth the tuneful lay,<br/>Lull with Amelia's liquid name the Nine,<br/>And sweetly flow through all the royal line.<br/><br/>_P_. Alas! few verses touch their nicer ear;<br/>They scarce can bear their Laureate twice a-year;<br/>And justly Caesar scorns the poet's lays,<br/>It is to history he trusts for praise.<br/><br/>_F_. Better be Cibber, I'll maintain it still,<br/>Than ridicule all taste, blaspheme quadrille,<br/>Abuse the city's best good men in metre,<br/>And laugh at peers that put their trust in Peter.<br/>Even those you touch not, hate you.<br/><br/>_P_.                What should ail them?<br/><br/>_F_. A hundred smart in Timon and in Balaam:<br/>The fewer still you name, you wound the more;<br/>Bond is but one, but Harpax is a score.<br/><br/>_P_. Each mortal has his pleasure: none deny<br/>Scarsdale his bottle, Darty his ham-pie;<br/>Ridotta sips and dances, till she see<br/>The doubling lustres dance as fast as she;<br/>F---- loves the Senate, Hockley-hole his brother,<br/>Like in all else, as one egg to another.<br/>I love to pour out all myself, as plain<br/>As downright Shippen, or as old Montaigne:<br/>In them, as certain to be loved as seen,<br/>The soul stood forth, nor kept a thought within;<br/>In me what spots (for spots I have) appear,<br/>Will prove at least the medium must be clear.<br/>In this impartial glass, my Muse intends<br/>Fair to expose myself, my foes, my friends;<br/>Publish the present age; but, where my text<br/>Is vice too high, reserve it for the next:<br/>My foes shall wish my life a longer date,<br/>And every friend the less lament my fate,<br/>My head and heart thus flowing through my quill,<br/>Verse-man or prose-man, term me which you will,<br/>Papist or Protestant, or both between,<br/>Like good Erasmus, in an honest mean,<br/>In moderation placing all my glory,<br/>While Tories call me Whig, and Whigs a Tory.<br/><br/>Satire's my weapon, but I'm too discreet<br/>To run a-muck, and tilt at all I meet;<br/>I only wear it in a land of hectors,<br/>Thieves, supercargoes, sharpers, and directors.<br/>Save but our army! and let Jove incrust<br/>Swords, pikes, and guns, with everlasting rust!<br/>Peace is my dear delight--not Fleury's more:<br/>But touch me, and no minister so sore.<br/>Whoe'er offends, at some unlucky time<br/>Slides into verse, and hitches in a rhyme,<br/>Sacred to ridicule his whole life long,<br/>And the sad burthen of some merry song.<br/><br/>Slander or poison dread from Delia's rage,<br/>Hard words or hanging, if your judge be Page.<br/>From furious Sappho scarce a milder fate,<br/>Pox'd by her love, or libell'd by her hate.<br/>Its proper power to hurt, each creature feels;<br/>Bulls aim their horns, and asses lift their heels;<br/>'Tis a bear's talent not to kick, but hug;<br/>And no man wonders he's not stung by pug.<br/>So drink with Walters, or with Chartres eat,<br/>They'll never poison you, they'll only cheat.<br/><br/>Then, learn√®d sir! (to cut the matter short)<br/>Whate'er my fate, or well or ill at court,<br/>Whether old age, with faint but cheerful ray,<br/>Attends to gild the evening of my day,<br/>Or death's black wing already be display'd,<br/>To wrap me in the universal shade;<br/>Whether the darken'd room to muse invite,<br/>Or whiten'd wall provoke the skewer to write:<br/>In durance, exile, Bedlam, or the Mint,<br/>Like Lee or Budgell, I will rhyme and print.<br/><br/>_F_. Alas, young man! your days can ne'er be long,<br/>In flower of age you perish for a song!<br/>Plums and directors, Shylock and his wife,<br/>Will club their testers, now, to take your life!<br/><br/>_P_. What? arm'd for Virtue, when I point the pen,<br/>Brand the bold front of shameless guilty men;<br/>Dash the proud gamester in his gilded car;<br/>Bare the mean heart that lurks beneath a star;<br/>Can there be wanting to defend her cause,<br/>Lights of the Church, or guardians of the laws?<br/>Could pension'd Boileau lash, in honest strain,<br/>Flatterers and bigots even in Louis' reign?<br/>Could Laureate Dryden pimp and friar engage,<br/>Yet neither Charles nor James be in a rage?<br/>And I not strip the gilding off a knave,<br/>Unplaced, unpension'd, no man's heir, or slave?<br/>I will, or perish in the generous cause:<br/>Hear this, and tremble! you who 'scape the laws.<br/>Yes, while I live, no rich or noble knave<br/>Shall walk the world, in credit, to his grave.<br/>TO VIRTUE ONLY, AND HER FRIENDS, A FRIEND,<br/>The world beside may murmur, or commend.<br/>Know, all the distant din that world can keep,<br/>Rolls o'er my grotto, and but soothes my sleep.<br/>There, my retreat the best companions grace,<br/>Chiefs out of war, and statesmen out of place.<br/>There St John mingles with my friendly bowl<br/>The feast of reason and the flow of soul:<br/>And he, whose lightning pierced th' Iberian lines,<br/>Now forms my quincunx, and now ranks my vines,<br/>Or tames the genius of the stubborn plain,<br/>Almost as quickly as he conquer'd Spain.<br/><br/>Envy must own, I live among the great,<br/>No pimp of pleasure, and no spy of state,<br/>With eyes that pry not, tongue that ne'er repeats,<br/>Fond to spread friendships, but to cover heats;<br/>To help who want, to forward who excel;--<br/>This, all who know me, know; who love me, tell;<br/>And who unknown defame me, let them be<br/>Scribblers or peers, alike are mob to me.<br/>This is my plea, on this I rest my cause--<br/>What saith my counsel, learn√®d in the laws?<br/><br/>_F_. Your plea is good; but still, I say, beware!<br/>Laws are explain'd by men--so have a care!<br/>It stands on record, that in Richard's times<br/>A man was hang'd for very honest rhymes.<br/>Consult the statute: _quart_. I think, it is,<br/>_Edwardi Sext_. or _prim, et quint. Eliz_.<br/>See 'Libels, Satires'--here you have it--read.<br/><br/>_P_. Libels and satires! lawless things indeed!<br/>But grave epistles, bringing vice to light,<br/>Such as a king might read, a bishop write,<br/>Such as Sir Robert would approve--<br/><br/>_F_.                           Indeed?<br/>The case is alter'd--you may then proceed;<br/>In such a cause the plaintiff will be hiss'd,<br/>My lords the judges laugh, and you're dismiss'd.
