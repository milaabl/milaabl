# üíÆ Adonais by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF JOHN KEATS,<br/>AUTHOR OF ENDYMION, HYPERION, ETC.<br/><br/>Aster prin men elampes eni zooisin Eoos<br/>nun de thanon lampeis Esperos en phthimenois.--PLATO.<br/><br/>I weep for Adonais--he is dead!<br/>O, weep for Adonais! though our tears<br/>Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!<br/>And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years<br/>To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,<br/>And teach them thine own sorrow, say: "With me<br/>Died Adonais; till the Future dares<br/>Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be<br/>An echo and a light unto eternity!"<br/><br/>Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay,<br/>When thy Son lay, pierced by the shaft which flies<br/>In darkness? where was lorn Urania<br/>When Adonais died? With veiled eyes,<br/>'Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise<br/>She sate, while one, with soft enamoured breath,<br/>Rekindled all the fading melodies,<br/>With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath,<br/>He had adorned and hid the coming bulk of Death.<br/><br/>Oh, weep for Adonais--he is dead!<br/>Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!<br/>Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed<br/>Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep<br/>Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep;<br/>For he is gone, where all things wise and fair<br/>Descend;--oh, dream not that the amorous Deep<br/>Will yet restore him to the vital air;<br/>Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.<br/><br/>Most musical of mourners, weep again!<br/>Lament anew, Urania!--He died,<br/>Who was the Sire of an immortal strain,<br/>Blind, old and lonely, when his country's pride,<br/>The priest, the slave, and the liberticide,<br/>Trampled and mocked with many a loathed rite<br/>Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified,<br/>Into the gulf of death; but his clear Sprite<br/>Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light.<br/><br/>Most musical of mourners, weep anew!<br/>Not all to that bright station dared to climb;<br/>And happier they their happiness who knew,<br/>Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time<br/>In which suns perished; others more sublime,<br/>Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,<br/>Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;<br/>And some yet live, treading the thorny road,<br/>Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode.<br/><br/>But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perished--<br/>The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew,<br/>Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,<br/>And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew;<br/>Most musical of mourners, weep anew!<br/>Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last,<br/>The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew<br/>Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;<br/>The broken lily lies--the storm is overpast.<br/><br/>To that high Capital, where kingly Death<br/>Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay,<br/>He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,<br/>A grave among the eternal.--Come away!<br/>Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day<br/>Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still<br/>He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;<br/>Awake him not! surely he takes his fill<br/>Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.<br/><br/>He will awake no more, oh, never more!--<br/>Within the twilight chamber spreads apace<br/>The shadow of white Death, and at the door<br/>Invisible Corruption waits to trace<br/>His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;<br/>The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe<br/>Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface<br/>So fair a prey, till darkness and the law<br/>Of change, shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw.<br/><br/>Oh, weep for Adonais!--The quick Dreams,<br/>The passion-winged Ministers of thought,<br/>Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams<br/>Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught<br/>The love which was its music, wander not,--<br/>Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain,<br/>But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lot<br/>Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,<br/>They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again.<br/><br/>And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head,<br/>And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries;<br/>'Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead;<br/>See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes,<br/>Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies<br/>A tear some Dream has loosened from his brain.'<br/>Lost Angel of a ruined Paradise!<br/>She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stain<br/>She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain.<br/><br/>One from a lucid urn of starry dew<br/>Washed his light limbs as if embalming them;<br/>Another clipped her profuse locks, and threw<br/>The wreath upon him, like an anadem,<br/>Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem;<br/>Another in her wilful grief would break<br/>Her bow and winged reeds, as if to stem<br/>A greater loss with one which was more weak;<br/>And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek.<br/><br/>Another Splendour on his mouth alit,<br/>That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath<br/>Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit,<br/>And pass into the panting heart beneath<br/>With lightning and with music: the damp death<br/>Quenched its caress upon his icy lips;<br/>And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath<br/>Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips,<br/>It flushed through his pale limbs, and passed to its eclipse.<br/><br/>And others came...Desires and Adorations,<br/>Winged Persuasions and veiled Destinies,<br/>Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations<br/>Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;<br/>And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs,<br/>And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam<br/>Of her own dying smile instead of eyes,<br/>Came in slow pomp;--the moving pomp might seem<br/>Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.<br/><br/>All he had loved, and moulded into thought,<br/>From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound,<br/>Lamented Adonais. Morning sought<br/>Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,<br/>Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,<br/>Dimmed the aereal eyes that kindle day;<br/>Afar the melancholy thunder moaned,<br/>Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay,<br/>And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay.<br/><br/>Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,<br/>And feeds her grief with his remembered lay,<br/>And will no more reply to winds or fountains,<br/>Or amorous birds perched on the young green spray,<br/>Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day;<br/>Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear<br/>Than those for whose disdain she pined away<br/>Into a shadow of all sounds:--a drear<br/>Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear.<br/><br/>Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down<br/>Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,<br/>Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown,<br/>For whom should she have waked the sullen year?<br/>To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear<br/>Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both<br/>Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere<br/>Amid the faint companions of their youth,<br/>With dew all turned to tears; odour, to sighing ruth.<br/><br/>Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale<br/>Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain;<br/>Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale<br/>Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain<br/>Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain,<br/>Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,<br/>As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain<br/>Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast,<br/>And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest!<br/><br/>Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,<br/>But grief returns with the revolving year;<br/>The airs and streams renew their joyous tone;<br/>The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;<br/>Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier;<br/>The amorous birds now pair in every brake,<br/>And build their mossy homes in field and brere;<br/>And the green lizard, and the golden snake,<br/>Like unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.<br/><br/>Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean<br/>A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst<br/>As it has ever done, with change and motion,<br/>From the great morning of the world when first<br/>God dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,<br/>The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;<br/>All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;<br/>Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight,<br/>The beauty and the joy of their renewed might.<br/><br/>The leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,<br/>Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;<br/>Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour<br/>Is changed to fragrance, they illumine death<br/>And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;<br/>Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows<br/>Be as a sword consumed before the sheath<br/>By sightless lightning?--the intense atom glows<br/>A moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.<br/><br/>Alas! that all we loved of him should be,<br/>But for our grief, as if it had not been,<br/>And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!<br/>Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene<br/>The actors or spectators? Great and mean<br/>Meet massed in death, who lends what life must borrow.<br/>As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,<br/>Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,<br/>Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow.<br/><br/>HE will awake no more, oh, never more!<br/>'Wake thou,' cried Misery, 'childless Mother, rise<br/>Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core,<br/>A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs.'<br/>And all the Dreams that watched Urania's eyes,<br/>And all the Echoes whom their sister's song<br/>Had held in holy silence, cried: 'Arise!'<br/>Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,<br/>From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.<br/><br/>She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs<br/>Out of the East, and follows wild and drear<br/>The golden Day, which, on eternal wings,<br/>Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,<br/>Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear<br/>So struck, so roused, so rapped Urania;<br/>So saddened round her like an atmosphere<br/>Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way<br/>Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay.<br/><br/>Out of her secret Paradise she sped,<br/>Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,<br/>And human hearts, which to her aery tread<br/>Yielding not, wounded the invisible<br/>Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell:<br/>And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they,<br/>Rent the soft Form they never could repel,<br/>Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,<br/>Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way.<br/><br/>In the death-chamber for a moment Death,<br/>Shamed by the presence of that living Might,<br/>Blushed to annihilation, and the breath<br/>Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light<br/>Flashed through those limbs, so late her dear delight.<br/>'Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,<br/>As silent lightning leaves the starless night!<br/>Leave me not!' cried Urania: her distress<br/>Roused Death: Death rose and smiled, and met her vain caress.<br/><br/>'Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;<br/>Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;<br/>And in my heartless breast and burning brain<br/>That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,<br/>With food of saddest memory kept alive,<br/>Now thou art dead, as if it were a part<br/>Of thee, my Adonais! I would give<br/>All that I am to be as thou now art!<br/>But I am chained to Time, and cannot thence depart!<br/><br/>'O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert,<br/>Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men<br/>Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart<br/>Dare the unpastured dragon in his den?<br/>Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then<br/>Wisdom the mirrored shield, or scorn the spear?<br/>Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when<br/>Thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere,<br/>The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer.<br/><br/>'The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;<br/>The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;<br/>The vultures to the conqueror's banner true<br/>Who feed where Desolation first has fed,<br/>And whose wings rain contagion;--how they fled,<br/>When, like Apollo, from his golden bow<br/>The Pythian of the age one arrow sped<br/>And smiled!--The spoilers tempt no second blow,<br/>They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low.<br/><br/>'The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn;<br/>He sets, and each ephemeral insect then<br/>Is gathered into death without a dawn,<br/>And the immortal stars awake again;<br/>So is it in the world of living men:<br/>A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight<br/>Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when<br/>It sinks, the swarms that dimmed or shared its light<br/>Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night.'<br/><br/>Thus ceased she: and the mountain shepherds came,<br/>Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent;<br/>The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame<br/>Over his living head like Heaven is bent,<br/>An early but enduring monument,<br/>Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song<br/>In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent<br/>The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong,<br/>And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue.<br/><br/>Midst others of less note, came one frail Form,<br/>A phantom among men; companionless<br/>As the last cloud of an expiring storm<br/>Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,<br/>Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,<br/>Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray<br/>With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,<br/>And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,<br/>Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.<br/><br/>A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift--<br/>A Love in desolation masked;--a Power<br/>Girt round with weakness;--it can scarce uplift<br/>The weight of the superincumbent hour;<br/>It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,<br/>A breaking billow;--even whilst we speak<br/>Is it not broken? On the withering flower<br/>The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek<br/>The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break.<br/><br/>His head was bound with pansies overblown,<br/>And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;<br/>And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,<br/>Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew<br/>Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew,<br/>Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart<br/>Shook the weak hand that grasped it; of that crew<br/>He came the last, neglected and apart;<br/>A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter's dart.<br/><br/>All stood aloof, and at his partial moan<br/>Smiled through their tears; well knew that gentle band<br/>Who in another's fate now wept his own,<br/>As in the accents of an unknown land<br/>He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scanned<br/>The Stranger's mien, and murmured: 'Who art thou?'<br/>He answered not, but with a sudden hand<br/>Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow,<br/>Which was like Cain's or Christ's--oh! that it should be so!<br/><br/>What softer voice is hushed over the dead?<br/>Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?<br/>What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed,<br/>In mockery of monumental stone,<br/>The heavy heart heaving without a moan?<br/>If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,<br/>Taught, soothed, loved, honoured the departed one,<br/>Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs,<br/>The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice.<br/><br/>Our Adonais has drunk poison--oh!<br/>What deaf and viperous murderer could crown<br/>Life's early cup with such a draught of woe?<br/>The nameless worm would now itself disown:<br/>It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone<br/>Whose prelude held all envy, hate and wrong,<br/>But what was howling in one breast alone,<br/>Silent with expectation of the song,<br/>Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung.<br/><br/>Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!<br/>Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,<br/>Thou noteless blot on a remembered name!<br/>But be thyself, and know thyself to be!<br/>And ever at thy season be thou free<br/>To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow;<br/>Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;<br/>Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,<br/>And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt--as now.<br/><br/>Nor let us weep that our delight is fled<br/>Far from these carrion kites that scream below;<br/>He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;<br/>Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now--<br/>Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow<br/>Back to the burning fountain whence it came,<br/>A portion of the Eternal, which must glow<br/>Through time and change, unquenchably the same,<br/>Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame.<br/><br/>Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep--<br/>He hath awakened from the dream of life--<br/>'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep<br/>With phantoms an unprofitable strife,<br/>And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife<br/>Invulnerable nothings.--WE decay<br/>Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief<br/>Convulse us and consume us day by day,<br/>And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.<br/><br/>He has outsoared the shadow of our night;<br/>Envy and calumny and hate and pain,<br/>And that unrest which men miscall delight,<br/>Can touch him not and torture not again;<br/>From the contagion of the world's slow stain<br/>He is secure, and now can never mourn<br/>A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain;<br/>Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn,<br/>With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.<br/><br/>He lives, he wakes--'tis Death is dead, not he;<br/>Mourn not for Adonais.--Thou young Dawn,<br/>Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee<br/>The spirit thou lamentest is not gone;<br/>Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!<br/>Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air,<br/>Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown<br/>O'er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bare<br/>Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!<br/><br/>He is made one with Nature: there is heard<br/>His voice in all her music, from the moan<br/>Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird;<br/>He is a presence to be felt and known<br/>In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,<br/>Spreading itself where'er that Power may move<br/>Which has withdrawn his being to its own;<br/>Which wields the world with never-wearied love,<br/>Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.<br/><br/>He is a portion of the loveliness<br/>Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear<br/>His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress<br/>Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there<br/>All new successions to the forms they wear;<br/>Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight<br/>To its own likeness, as each mass may bear;<br/>And bursting in its beauty and its might<br/>From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light.<br/><br/>The splendours of the firmament of time<br/>May be eclipsed, but are extinguished not;<br/>Like stars to their appointed height they climb,<br/>And death is a low mist which cannot blot<br/>The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought<br/>Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair,<br/>And love and life contend in it, for what<br/>Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there<br/>And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.<br/><br/>The inheritors of unfulfilled renown<br/>Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought,<br/>Far in the Unapparent. Chatterton<br/>Rose pale,--his solemn agony had not<br/>Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought<br/>And as he fell and as he lived and loved<br/>Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,<br/>Arose; and Lucan, by his death approved:<br/>Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.<br/><br/>And many more, whose names on Earth are dark,<br/>But whose transmitted effluence cannot die<br/>So long as fire outlives the parent spark,<br/>Rose, robed in dazzling immortality.<br/>'Thou art become as one of us,' they cry,<br/>'It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long<br/>Swung blind in unascended majesty,<br/>Silent alone amid a Heaven of Song.<br/>Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!'<br/><br/>Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth,<br/>Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright.<br/>Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth;<br/>As from a centre, dart thy spirit's light<br/>Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might<br/>Satiate the void circumference: then shrink<br/>Even to a point within our day and night;<br/>And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink<br/>When hope has kindled hope, and lured thee to the brink.<br/><br/>Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre,<br/>Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought<br/>That ages, empires and religions there<br/>Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought;<br/>For such as he can lend,--they borrow not<br/>Glory from those who made the world their prey;<br/>And he is gathered to the kings of thought<br/>Who waged contention with their time's decay,<br/>And of the past are all that cannot pass away.<br/><br/>Go thou to Rome,--at once the Paradise,<br/>The grave, the city, and the wilderness;<br/>And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,<br/>And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress<br/>The bones of Desolation's nakedness<br/>Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead<br/>Thy footsteps to a slope of green access<br/>Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead<br/>A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;<br/><br/>And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time<br/>Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;<br/>And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,<br/>Pavilioning the dust of him who planned<br/>This refuge for his memory, doth stand<br/>Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,<br/>A field is spread, on which a newer band<br/>Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,<br/>Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.<br/><br/>Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet<br/>To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned<br/>Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,<br/>Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,<br/>Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find<br/>Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,<br/>Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind<br/>Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.<br/>What Adonais is, why fear we to become?<br/><br/>The One remains, the many change and pass;<br/>Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;<br/>Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,<br/>Stains the white radiance of Eternity,<br/>Until Death tramples it to fragments.--Die,<br/>If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!<br/>Follow where all is fled!--Rome's azure sky,<br/>Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak<br/>The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.<br/><br/>Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?<br/>Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here<br/>They have departed; thou shouldst now depart!<br/>A light is passed from the revolving year,<br/>And man, and woman; and what still is dear<br/>Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.<br/>The soft sky smiles,--the low wind whispers near:<br/>'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither,<br/>No more let Life divide what Death can join together.<br/><br/>That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,<br/>That Beauty in which all things work and move,<br/>That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse<br/>Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love<br/>Which through the web of being blindly wove<br/>By man and beast and earth and air and sea,<br/>Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of<br/>The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,<br/>Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.<br/><br/>The breath whose might I have invoked in song<br/>Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven,<br/>Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng<br/>Whose sails were never to the tempest given;<br/>The massy earth and sphered skies are riven!<br/>I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;<br/>Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,<br/>The soul of Adonais, like a star,<br/>Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.
