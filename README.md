  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Question by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way,<br/>Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,<br/>And gentle odours led my steps astray,<br/>Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring<br/>Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay<br/>Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling<br/>Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,<br/>But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream.<br/><br/>There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,<br/>Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,<br/>The constellated flower that never sets;<br/>Faint oxslips; tender bluebells, at whose birth<br/>The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets--<br/>Like a child, half in tenderness and mirth--<br/>Its mother's face with Heaven's collected tears,<br/>When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.<br/><br/>And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,<br/>Green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured may,<br/>And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine<br/>Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the day;<br/>And wild roses, and ivy serpentine,<br/>With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;<br/>And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,<br/>Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.<br/><br/>And nearer to the river's trembling edge<br/>There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with white.<br/>And starry river buds among the sedge,<br/>And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,<br/>Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge<br/>With moonlight beams of their own watery light;<br/>And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green<br/>As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.<br/><br/>Methought that of these visionary flowers<br/>I made a nosegay, bound in such a way<br/>That the same hues, which in their natural bowers<br/>Were mingled or opposed, the like array<br/>Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours<br/>Within my hand,--and then, elate and gay,<br/>I hastened to the spot whence I had come,<br/>That I might there present it!--Oh! to whom?
</p>
