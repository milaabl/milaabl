# üíÆ The Curse of Minerva by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
                       Pallas te hoc Vulnere Pallas<br/>  Immolat et poenam scelerato ex Sanguine Sumit.<br/><br/>Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run,<br/>Along Morea's hills the setting Sun;<br/>Not, as in northern climes, obscurely bright,<br/>But one unclouded blaze of living light;<br/>O'er the hushed deep the yellow beam he throws,<br/>Gilds the green wave that trembles as it glows;<br/>On old √Ügina's rock and Hydra's isle<br/>The God of gladness sheds his parting smile;<br/>O'er his own regions lingering loves to shine,<br/>Though there his altars are no more divine.<br/>Descending fast, the mountain-shadows kiss<br/>Thy glorious Gulf, unconquered Salamis!<br/>Their azure arches through the long expanse,<br/>More deeply purpled, meet his mellowing glance,<br/>And tenderest tints, along their summits driven,<br/>Mark his gay course, and own the hues of Heaven;<br/>Till, darkly shaded from the land and deep,<br/>Behind his Delphian rock he sinks to sleep.<br/><br/>  On such an eve his palest beam he cast<br/>When, Athens! here thy Wisest looked his last.<br/>How watched thy better sons his farewell ray,<br/>That closed their murdered Sage's latest day!<br/>Not yet--not yet--Sol pauses on the hill,<br/>The precious hour of parting lingers still;<br/>But sad his light to agonizing eyes,<br/>And dark the mountain's once delightful dyes;<br/>Gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour,<br/>The land where Phoebus never frowned before;<br/>But ere he sunk below Cithaeron's head,<br/>The cup of Woe was quaffed--the Spirit fled;<br/>The soul of Him that scorned to fear or fly,<br/>Who lived and died as none can live or die.<br/><br/>  But lo! from high Hymettus to the plain<br/>The Queen of Night asserts her silent reign;<br/>No murky vapour, herald of the storm,<br/>Hides her fair face, or girds her glowing form;<br/>With cornice glimmering as the moonbeams play,<br/>There the white column greets her grateful ray,<br/>And bright around, with quivering beams beset,<br/>Her emblem sparkles o'er the Minaret;<br/>The groves of olive scattered dark and wide,<br/>Where meek Cephisus sheds his scanty tide,<br/>The cypress saddening by the sacred mosque,<br/>The gleaming turret of the gay kiosk,<br/>And sad and sombre 'mid the holy calm,<br/>Near Theseus' fane, yon solitary palm;<br/>All, tinged with varied hues, arrest the eye;<br/>And dull were his that passed them heedless by.<br/>Again the √Ügean, heard no more afar,<br/>Lulls his chafed breast from elemental war:<br/>Again his waves in milder tints unfold<br/>Their long expanse of sapphire and of gold,<br/>Mixed with the shades of many a distant isle<br/>That frown, where gentler Ocean deigns to smile.<br/><br/>  As thus, within the walls of Pallas' fane,<br/>I marked the beauties of the land and main,<br/>Alone, and friendless, on the magic shore,<br/>Whose arts and arms but live in poets' lore;<br/>Oft as the matchless dome I turned to scan,<br/>Sacred to Gods, but not secure from Man,<br/>The Past returned, the Present seemed to cease,<br/>And Glory knew no clime beyond her Greece!<br/><br/>  Hour rolled along, and Dian's orb on high<br/>Had gained the centre of her softest sky;<br/>And yet unwearied still my footsteps trod<br/>O'er the vain shrine of many a vanished God:<br/>But chiefly, Pallas! thine, when Hecate's glare<br/>Checked by thy columns, fell more sadly fair<br/>O'er the chill marble, where the startling tread<br/>Thrills the lone heart like echoes from the dead.<br/>Long had I mused, and treasured every trace<br/>The wreck of Greece recorded of her race,<br/>When, lo! a giant-form before me strode,<br/>And Pallas hailed me in her own Abode!<br/><br/>  Yes,'twas Minerva's self; but, ah! how changed,<br/>Since o'er the Dardan field in arms she ranged!<br/>Not such as erst, by her divine command,<br/>Her form appeared from Phidias' plastic hand:<br/>Gone were the terrors of her awful brow,<br/>Her idle √Ügis bore no Gorgon now;<br/>Her helm was dinted, and the broken lance<br/>Seemed weak and shaftless e'en to mortal glance;<br/>The Olive Branch, which still she deigned to clasp,<br/>Shrunk from her touch, and withered in her grasp;<br/>And, ah! though still the brightest of the sky,<br/>Celestial tears bedimmed her large blue eye;<br/>Round the rent casque her owlet circled slow,<br/>And mourned his mistress with a shriek of woe!<br/><br/>  "Mortal!"--'twas thus she spake--"that blush of shame<br/>Proclaims thee Briton, once a noble name;<br/>First of the mighty, foremost of the free,<br/>Now honoured 'less' by all, and 'least' by me:<br/>Chief of thy foes shall Pallas still be found.<br/>Seek'st thou the cause of loathing!--look around.<br/>Lo! here, despite of war and wasting fire,<br/>I saw successive Tyrannies expire;<br/>'Scaped from the ravage of the Turk and Goth,<br/>Thy country sends a spoiler worse than both.<br/>Survey this vacant, violated fane;<br/>Recount the relics torn that yet remain:<br/>'These' Cecrops placed, 'this' Pericles adorned,<br/>'That' Adrian reared when drooping Science mourned.<br/>What more I owe let Gratitude attest--<br/>Know, Alaric and Elgin did the rest.<br/>That all may learn from whence the plunderer came,<br/>The insulted wall sustains his hated name:<br/>For Elgin's fame thus grateful Pallas pleads,<br/>Below, his name--above, behold his deeds!<br/>Be ever hailed with equal honour here<br/>The Gothic monarch and the Pictish peer:<br/>Arms gave the first his right, the last had none,<br/>But basely stole what less barbarians won.<br/>So when the Lion quits his fell repast,<br/>Next prowls the Wolf, the filthy Jackal last:<br/>Flesh, limbs, and blood the former make their own,<br/>The last poor brute securely gnaws the bone.<br/>Yet still the Gods are just, and crimes are crossed:<br/>See here what Elgin won, and what he lost!<br/>Another name with _his_ pollutes my shrine:<br/>Behold where Dian's beams disdain to shine!<br/>Some retribution still might Pallas claim,<br/>When Venus half avenged Minerva's shame."<br/><br/>  She ceased awhile, and thus I dared reply,<br/>To soothe the vengeance kindling in her eye:<br/>"Daughter of Jove! in Britain's injured name,<br/>A true-born Briton may the deed disclaim.<br/>Frown not on England; England owns him not:<br/>Athena, no! thy plunderer was a Scot.<br/>Ask'st thou the difference? From fair Phyles' towers<br/>Survey Boeotia;--Caledonia's ours.<br/>And well I know within that bastard land<br/>Hath Wisdom's goddess never held command;<br/>A barren soil, where Nature's germs, confined<br/>To stern sterility, can stint the mind;<br/>Whose thistle well betrays the niggard earth,<br/>Emblem of all to whom the Land gives birth;<br/>Each genial influence nurtured to resist;<br/>A land of meanness, sophistry, and mist.<br/>Each breeze from foggy mount and marshy plain<br/>Dilutes with drivel every drizzly brain,<br/>Till, burst at length, each wat'ry head o'erflows,<br/>Foul as their soil, and frigid as their snows:<br/>Then thousand schemes of petulance and pride<br/>Despatch her scheming children far and wide;<br/>Some East, some West, some--everywhere but North!<br/>In quest of lawless gain, they issue forth.<br/>And thus--accursed be the day and year!<br/>She sent a Pict to play the felon here.<br/>Yet Caledonia claims some native worth,<br/>As dull Boeotia gave a Pindar birth;<br/>So may her few, the lettered and the brave,<br/>Bound to no clime, and victors of the grave,<br/>Shake off the sordid dust of such a land,<br/>And shine like children of a happier strand;<br/>As once, of yore, in some obnoxious place,<br/>Ten names (if found) had saved a wretched race."<br/><br/>  "Mortal!" the blue-eyed maid resumed, "once more<br/>Bear back my mandate to thy native shore.<br/>Though fallen, alas! this vengeance yet is mine,<br/>To turn my counsels far from lands like thine.<br/>Hear then in silence Pallas' stern behest;<br/>Hear and believe, for Time will tell the rest.<br/><br/>  "First on the head of him who did this deed<br/>My curse shall light,--on him and all his seed:<br/>Without one spark of intellectual fire,<br/>Be all the sons as senseless as the sire:<br/>If one with wit the parent brood disgrace,<br/>Believe him bastard of a brighter race:<br/>Still with his hireling artists let him prate,<br/>And Folly's praise repay for Wisdom's hate;<br/>Long of their Patron's gusto let them tell,<br/>Whose noblest, _native_ gusto is--to sell:<br/>To sell, and make--may shame record the day!--<br/>The State--Receiver of his pilfered prey.<br/>Meantime, the flattering, feeble dotard, West,<br/>Europe's worst dauber, and poor Britain's best,<br/>With palsied hand shall turn each model o'er,<br/>And own himself an infant of fourscore.<br/>Be all the Bruisers culled from all St. Giles',<br/>That Art and Nature may compare their styles;<br/>While brawny brutes in stupid wonder stare,<br/>And marvel at his Lordship's 'stone shop' there.<br/>Round the thronged gate shall sauntering coxcombs creep<br/>To lounge and lucubrate, to prate and peep;<br/>While many a languid maid, with longing sigh,<br/>On giant statues casts the curious eye;<br/>The room with transient glance appears to skim,<br/>Yet marks the mighty back and length of limb;<br/>Mourns o'er the difference of _now_ and _then_;<br/>Exclaims, 'These Greeks indeed were proper men!'<br/>Draws slight comparisons of 'these' with 'those',<br/>And envies La√Øs all her Attic beaux.<br/>When shall a modern maid have swains like these?<br/>Alas! Sir Harry is no Hercules!<br/>And last of all, amidst the gaping crew,<br/>Some calm spectator, as he takes his view,<br/>In silent indignation mixed with grief,<br/>Admires the plunder, but abhors the thief.<br/>Oh, loathed in life, nor pardoned in the dust,<br/>May Hate pursue his sacrilegious lust!<br/>Linked with the fool that fired the Ephesian dome,<br/>Shall vengeance follow far beyond the tomb,<br/>And Eratostratus and Elgin shine<br/>In many a branding page and burning line;<br/>Alike reserved for aye to stand accursed,<br/>Perchance the second blacker than the first.<br/><br/>  "So let him stand, through ages yet unborn,<br/>Fixed statue on the pedestal of Scorn;<br/>Though not for him alone revenge shall wait,<br/>But fits thy country for her coming fate:<br/>Hers were the deeds that taught her lawless son<br/>To do what oft Britannia's self had done.<br/>Look to the Baltic--blazing from afar,<br/>Your old Ally yet mourns perfidious war.<br/>Not to such deeds did Pallas lend her aid,<br/>Or break the compact which herself had made;<br/>Far from such counsels, from the faithless field<br/>She fled--but left behind her Gorgon shield;<br/>A fatal gift that turned your friends to stone,<br/>And left lost Albion hated and alone.<br/><br/>"Look to the East, where Ganges' swarthy race<br/>Shall shake your tyrant empire to its base;<br/>Lo! there Rebellion rears her ghastly head,<br/>And glares the Nemesis of native dead;<br/>Till Indus rolls a deep purpureal flood,<br/>And claims his long arrear of northern blood.<br/>So may ye perish!--Pallas, when she gave<br/>Your free-born rights, forbade ye to enslave.<br/><br/>  "Look on your Spain!--she clasps the hand she hates,<br/>But boldly clasps, and thrusts you from her gates.<br/>Bear witness, bright Barossa! thou canst tell<br/>Whose were the sons that bravely fought and fell.<br/>But Lusitania, kind and dear ally,<br/>Can spare a few to fight, and sometimes fly.<br/>Oh glorious field! by Famine fiercely won,<br/>The Gaul retires for once, and all is done!<br/>But when did Pallas teach, that one retreat<br/>Retrieved three long Olympiads of defeat?<br/><br/>  "Look last at home--ye love not to look there<br/>On the grim smile of comfortless despair:<br/>Your city saddens: loud though Revel howls,<br/>Here Famine faints, and yonder Rapine prowls.<br/>See all alike of more or less bereft;<br/>No misers tremble when there's nothing left.<br/>'Blest paper credit;' who shall dare to sing?<br/>It clogs like lead Corruption's weary wing.<br/>Yet Pallas pluck'd each Premier by the ear,<br/>Who Gods and men alike disdained to hear;<br/>But one, repentant o'er a bankrupt state,<br/>On Pallas calls,--but calls, alas! too late:<br/>Then raves for'----'; to that Mentor bends,<br/>Though he and Pallas never yet were friends.<br/>Him senates hear, whom never yet they heard,<br/>Contemptuous once, and now no less absurd.<br/>So, once of yore, each reasonable frog,<br/>Swore faith and fealty to his sovereign 'log.'<br/>Thus hailed your rulers their patrician clod,<br/>As Egypt chose an onion for a God.<br/><br/>  "Now fare ye well! enjoy your little hour;<br/>Go, grasp the shadow of your vanished power;<br/>Gloss o'er the failure of each fondest scheme;<br/>Your strength a name, your bloated wealth a dream.<br/>Gone is that Gold, the marvel of mankind.<br/>And Pirates barter all that's left behind.<br/>No more the hirelings, purchased near and far,<br/>Crowd to the ranks of mercenary war.<br/>The idle merchant on the useless quay<br/>Droops o'er the bales no bark may bear away;<br/>Or, back returning, sees rejected stores<br/>Rot piecemeal on his own encumbered shores:<br/>The starved mechanic breaks his rusting loom,<br/>And desperate mans him 'gainst the coming doom.<br/>Then in the Senates of your sinking state<br/>Show me the man whose counsels may have weight.<br/>Vain is each voice where tones could once command;<br/>E'en factions cease to charm a factious land:<br/>Yet jarring sects convulse a sister Isle,<br/>And light with maddening hands the mutual pile.<br/><br/>  "'Tis done, 'tis past--since Pallas warns in vain;<br/>The Furies seize her abdicated reign:<br/>Wide o'er the realm they wave their kindling brands,<br/>And wring her vitals with their fiery hands.<br/>But one convulsive struggle still remains,<br/>And Gaul shall weep ere Albion wear her chains,<br/>The bannered pomp of war, the glittering files,<br/>O'er whose gay trappings stern Bellona smiles;<br/>The brazen trump, the spirit-stirring drum,<br/>That bid the foe defiance ere they come;<br/>The hero bounding at his country's call,<br/>The glorious death that consecrates his fall,<br/>Swell the young heart with visionary charms.<br/>And bid it antedate the joys of arms.<br/>But know, a lesson you may yet be taught,<br/>With death alone are laurels cheaply bought;<br/>Not in the conflict Havoc seeks delight,<br/>His day of mercy is the day of fight.<br/>But when the field is fought, the battle won,<br/>Though drenched with gore, his woes are but begun:<br/>His deeper deeds as yet ye know by name;<br/>The slaughtered peasant and the ravished dame,<br/>The rifled mansion and the foe-reaped field,<br/>Ill suit with souls at home, untaught to yield.<br/>Say with what eye along the distant down<br/>Would flying burghers mark the blazing town?<br/>How view the column of ascending flames<br/>Shake his red shadow o'er the startled Thames?<br/>Nay, frown not, Albion! for the torch was thine<br/>That lit such pyres from Tagus to the Rhine:<br/>Now should they burst on thy devoted coast,<br/>Go, ask thy bosom who deserves them most?<br/>The law of Heaven and Earth is life for life,<br/>And she who raised, in vain regrets, the strife."
