# üíÆ Heaven and Earth by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    PART I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A woody and mountainous district near Mount<br/>                    Ararat.--Time, midnight_.<br/><br/>               _Enter_ ANAH _and_ AHOLIBAMAH.<br/><br/>_Anah_. OUR father sleeps: it is the hour when they<br/>Who love us are accustomed to descend<br/>Through the deep clouds o'er rocky Ararat:--<br/>How my heart beats!<br/><br/>_Aho._               Let us proceed upon<br/>Our invocation.<br/><br/>_Anah_.         But the stars are hidden.<br/>I tremble.<br/><br/>_Aho._     So do I, but not with fear<br/>Of aught save their delay.<br/><br/>_Anah_.                    My sister, though<br/>I love Azaziel more than----oh, too much!<br/>What was I going to say? my heart grows impious.<br/><br/>_Aho._ And where is the impiety of loving<br/>Celestial natures?<br/><br/>_Anah_.            But, Aholibamah,<br/>I love our God less since his angel loved me:<br/>This cannot be of good; and though I know not<br/>That I do wrong, I feel a thousand fears<br/>Which are not ominous of right.<br/><br/>_Aho._                          Then wed thee<br/>Unto some son of clay, and toil and spin!<br/>There's Japhet loves thee well, hath loved thee long:<br/>Marry, and bring forth dust!<br/><br/>_Anah_.                      I should have loved<br/>Azaziel not less were he mortal; yet<br/>I am glad he is not. I cannot outlive him.<br/>And when I think that his immortal wings<br/>Will one day hover o'er the sepulchre<br/>Of the poor child of clay which so adored him,<br/>As he adores the Highest, death becomes<br/>Less terrible; but yet I pity him:<br/>His grief will be of ages, or at least<br/>Mine would be such for him, were I the Seraph,<br/>And he the perishable.<br/><br/>_Aho._                 Rather say,<br/>That he will single forth some other daughter<br/>Of earth, and love her as he once loved Anah.<br/><br/>_Anah_. And if it should be so, and she loved him,<br/>Better thus than that he should weep for me.<br/><br/>_Aho._ If I thought thus of Samiasa's love,<br/>All Seraph as he is, I'd spurn him from me.<br/>But to our invocation!--'Tis the hour.<br/><br/>_Anah_.<br/>                Seraph!<br/>             From thy sphere!<br/>  Whatever star contain thy glory;<br/>    In the eternal depths of heaven<br/>    Albeit thou watchest with "the seven,"<br/>  Though through space infinite and hoary<br/>    Before thy bright wings worlds be driven,<br/>                   Yet hear!<br/>  Oh! think of her who holds thee dear!<br/>    And though she nothing is to thee,<br/>  Yet think that thou art all to her.<br/>    Thou canst not tell,--and never be<br/>    Such pangs decreed to aught save me,--<br/>      The bitterness of tears.<br/>      Eternity is in thine years,<br/>  Unborn, undying beauty in thine eyes;<br/>  With me thou canst not sympathise,<br/>    Except in love, and there thou must<br/>    Acknowledge that more loving dust<br/>  Ne'er wept beneath the skies.<br/>  Thou walk'st thy many worlds, thou see'st<br/>    The face of him who made thee great,<br/>  As he hath made me of the least<br/>    Of those cast out from Eden's gate:<br/>              Yet, Seraph dear!<br/>                  Oh hear!<br/>  For thou hast loved me, and I would not die<br/>    Until I know what I must die in knowing,<br/>  That thou forget'st in thine eternity<br/>    Her whose heart Death could not keep from o'er-flowing<br/>  For thee, immortal essence as thou art!<br/>    Great is their love who love in sin and fear;<br/>  And such, I feel, are waging in my heart<br/>  A war unworthy: to an Adamite<br/>    Forgive, my Seraph! that such thoughts appear,<br/>      For sorrow is our element;<br/>                 Delight<br/>  An Eden kept afar from sight,<br/>      Though sometimes with our visions blent.<br/>              The hour is near<br/>  Which tells me we are not abandoned quite.--<br/>               Appear! Appear!<br/>                  Seraph!<br/>      My own Azaziel! be but here,<br/>  And leave the stars to their own light!<br/><br/>_Aho._<br/>               Samiasa!<br/>               Wheresoe'er<br/>      Thou rulest in the upper air--<br/>      Or warring with the spirits who may dare<br/>              Dispute with him<br/>    Who made all empires, empire; or recalling<br/>  Some wandering star, which shoots through the abyss,<br/>    Whose tenants dying, while their world is falling,<br/>  Share the dim destiny of clay in this;<br/>    Or joining with the inferior cherubim,<br/>    Thou deignest to partake their hymn--<br/>               Samiasa!<br/>  I call thee, I await thee, and I love thee.<br/>    Many may worship thee, that will I not:<br/>  If that thy spirit down to mine may move thee,<br/>    Descend and share my lot!<br/>    Though I be formed of clay,<br/>      And thou of beams<br/>    More bright than those of day<br/>      On Eden's streams,<br/>    Thine immortality can not repay<br/>      With love more warm than mine<br/>    My love. There is a ray<br/>      In me, which, though forbidden yet to shine,<br/>      I feel was lighted at thy God's and thine.<br/>    It may be hidden long: death and decay<br/>      Our mother Eve bequeathed us--but my heart<br/>    Defies it: though this life must pass away,<br/>      Is _that_ a cause for thee and me to part?<br/>    Thou art immortal--so am I: I feel--<br/>      I feel my immortality o'ersweep<br/>    All pains, all tears, all fears, and peal,<br/>      Like the eternal thunders of the deep,<br/>    Into my ears this truth--"Thou liv'st for ever!"<br/>        But if it be in joy<br/>    I know not, nor would know;<br/>  That secret rests with the Almighty giver,<br/>    Who folds in clouds the fonts of bliss and woe.<br/>        But thee and me he never can destroy;<br/>    Change us he may, but not o'erwhelm; we are<br/>    Of as eternal essence, and must war<br/>    With him if he will war with us; with _thee_<br/>      I can share all things, even immortal sorrow;<br/>    For thou hast ventured to share life with _me_,<br/>    And shall _I_ shrink from thine eternity?<br/>      No! though the serpent's sting should pierce me thorough,<br/>    And thou thyself wert like the serpent, coil<br/>      Around me still! and I will smile,<br/>            And curse thee not; but hold<br/>          Thee in as warm a fold<br/>          As----but descend, and prove<br/>          A mortal's love<br/>  For an immortal. If the skies contain<br/>  More joy than thou canst give and take, remain!<br/><br/>_Anah_. Sister! sister! I view them winging<br/>Their bright way through the parted night.<br/><br/>_Aho._ The clouds from off their pinions flinging,<br/>As though they bore to-morrow's light.<br/><br/>_Anah_. But if our father see the sight!<br/><br/>_Aho._ He would but deem it was the moon<br/>Rising unto some sorcerer's tune<br/>An hour too soon.<br/><br/>_Anah_. They come! _he_ comes!--Azaziel!<br/><br/>_Aho._                                   Haste<br/>To meet them! Oh! for wings to bear<br/>My spirit, while they hover there,<br/>        To Samiasa's breast!<br/><br/>_Anah_. Lo! they have kindled all the west,<br/>Like a returning sunset;--lo!<br/>        On Ararat's late secret crest<br/>A mild and many-coloured bow,<br/>The remnant of their flashing path,<br/>Now shines! and now, behold! it hath<br/>Returned to night, as rippling foam,<br/>  Which the Leviathan hath lashed<br/>From his unfathomable home,<br/>When sporting on the face of the calm deep,<br/>  Subsides soon after he again hath dashed<br/>Down, down, to where the Ocean's fountains sleep.<br/><br/>_Aho._ They have touched earth! Samiasa!<br/><br/>_Anah_.                                 My Azaziel!<br/>                                                            [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_Enter_ IRAD _and_ JAPHET.<br/><br/>_Irad_. Despond not: wherefore wilt thou wander thus<br/>To add thy silence to the silent night,<br/>And lift thy tearful eye unto the stars?<br/>They cannot aid thee.<br/><br/>_Japh._               But they soothe me--now<br/>Perhaps she looks upon them as I look.<br/>Methinks a being that is beautiful<br/>Becometh more so as it looks on beauty,<br/>The eternal beauty of undying things.<br/>Oh, Anah!<br/><br/>_Irad_.    But she loves thee not.<br/><br/>_Japh._                           Alas!<br/><br/>_Irad_. And proud Aholibamah spurns me also.<br/><br/>_Japh._ I feel for thee too.<br/><br/>_Irad_.                      Let her keep her pride,<br/>Mine hath enabled me to bear her scorn:<br/>It may be, time too will avenge it.<br/><br/>_Japh._                            Canst thou<br/>Find joy in such a thought?<br/><br/>_Irad_.                     Nor joy nor sorrow.<br/>I loved her well; I would have loved her better,<br/>Had love been met with love: as 'tis, I leave her<br/>To brighter destinies, if so she deems them.<br/><br/>_Japh._ What destinies?<br/><br/>_Irad_.                 I have some cause to think<br/>She loves another.<br/><br/>_Japh._             Anah!<br/><br/>_Irad_.                  No; her sister.<br/><br/>_Japh._ What other?<br/><br/>_Irad_.             That I know not; but her air,<br/>If not her words, tells me she loves another.<br/><br/>_Japh._ Aye, but not Anah: she but loves her God.<br/><br/>_Irad_. Whate'er she loveth, so she loves thee not,<br/>What can it profit thee?<br/><br/>_Japh._                  True, nothing; but<br/>I love.<br/><br/>_Irad_. And so did I.<br/><br/>_Japh._               And now thou lov'st not,<br/>Or think'st thou lov'st not, art thou happier?<br/><br/>_Irad_.                                       Yes.<br/><br/>_Japh._ I pity thee.<br/><br/>_Irad_.              Me! why?<br/><br/>_Japh._                      For being happy,<br/>Deprived of that which makes my misery.<br/><br/>_Irad_. I take thy taunt as part of thy distemper,<br/>And would not feel as thou dost for more shekels<br/>Than all our father's herds would bring, if weighed<br/>Against the metal of the sons of Cain--<br/>The yellow dust they try to barter with us,<br/>As if such useless and discoloured trash,<br/>The refuse of the earth, could be received<br/>For milk, and wool, and flesh, and fruits, and all<br/>Our flocks and wilderness afford.--Go, Japhet,<br/>Sigh to the stars, as wolves howl to the moon--<br/>I must back to my rest.<br/><br/>_Japh._                  And so would I<br/>If I could rest.<br/><br/>_Irad_.          Thou wilt not to our tents then?<br/><br/>_Japh._ No, Irad; I will to the cavern, whose<br/>Mouth they say opens from the internal world,<br/>To let the inner spirits of the earth<br/>Forth when they walk its surface.<br/><br/>_Irad_.                            Wherefore so?<br/>What wouldst thou there?<br/><br/>_Japh._                   Soothe further my sad spirit<br/>With gloom as sad: it is a hopeless spot,<br/>And I am hopeless.<br/><br/>_Irad_.            But 'tis dangerous;<br/>Strange sounds and sights have peopled it with terrors.<br/>I must go with thee.<br/><br/>_Japh._               Irad, no; believe me<br/>I feel no evil thought, and fear no evil.<br/><br/>_Irad_. But evil things will be thy foe the more<br/>As not being of them: turn thy steps aside,<br/>Or let mine be with thine.<br/><br/>_Japh._                    No, neither, Irad;<br/>I must proceed alone.<br/><br/>_Irad_.                Then peace be with thee!<br/>                                                         [_Exit_ IRAD.<br/><br/>_Japh._ (_solus_).<br/>Peace! I have sought it where it should be found,<br/>In love--with love, too, which perhaps deserved it;<br/>And, in its stead, a heaviness of heart,<br/>A weakness of the spirit, listless days,<br/>And nights inexorable to sweet sleep<br/>Have come upon me. Peace! what peace? the calm<br/>Of desolation, and the stillness of<br/>The untrodden forest, only broken by<br/>The sweeping tempest through its groaning boughs;<br/>Such is the sullen or the fitful state<br/>Of my mind overworn. The Earth's grown wicked,<br/>And many signs and portents have proclaimed<br/>A change at hand, and an o'erwhelming doom<br/>To perishable beings. Oh, my Anah!<br/>When the dread hour denounced shall open wide<br/>The fountains of the deep, how mightest thou<br/>Have lain within this bosom, folded from<br/>The elements; this bosom, which in vain<br/>Hath beat for thee, and then will beat more vainly,<br/>While thine--Oh, God! at least remit to her<br/>Thy wrath! for she is pure amidst the failing<br/>As a star in the clouds, which cannot quench,<br/>Although they obscure it for an hour. My Anah!<br/>How would I have adored thee, but thou wouldst not;<br/>And still would I redeem thee--see thee live<br/>When Ocean is earth's grave, and, unopposed<br/>By rock or shallow, the Leviathan,<br/>Lord of the shoreless sea and watery world,<br/>Shall wonder at his boundlessness of realm.            [_Exit_ JAPHET.<br/><br/>                      _Enter_ NOAH _and_ SHEM.<br/><br/>_Noah_. Where is thy brother Japhet?<br/><br/>_Shem_.                              He went forth,<br/>According to his wont, to meet with Irad,<br/>He said; but, as I fear, to bend his steps<br/>Towards Anah's tents, round which he hovers nightly,<br/>Like a dove round and round its pillaged nest;<br/>Or else he walks the wild up to the cavern<br/>Which opens to the heart of Ararat.<br/><br/>_Noah_. What doth he there? It is an evil spot<br/>Upon an earth all evil; for things worse<br/>Than even wicked men resort there: he<br/>Still loves this daughter of a fated race,<br/>Although he could not wed her if she loved him,<br/>And that she doth not. Oh, the unhappy hearts<br/>Of men! that one of my blood, knowing well<br/>The destiny and evil of these days,<br/>And that the hour approacheth, should indulge<br/>In such forbidden yearnings! Lead the way;<br/>He must be sought for!<br/><br/>_Shem_.                 Go not forward, father:<br/>I will seek Japhet.<br/><br/>_Noah_.              Do not fear for me:<br/>All evil things are powerless on the man<br/>Selected by Jehovah.--Let us on.<br/><br/>_Shem_. To the tents of the father of the sisters?<br/><br/>_Noah_. No; to the cavern of the Caucasus.<br/>                                           [_Exeunt_ NOAH _and_ SHEM.<br/><br/>SCENE III.--_The mountains.--A cavern, and the rocks<br/>                 of Caucasus_.<br/><br/>_Japh._ (_solus_). Ye wilds, that look eternal; and thou cave,<br/>Which seem'st unfathomable; and ye mountains,<br/>So varied and so terrible in beauty;<br/>Here, in your rugged majesty of rocks<br/>And toppling trees that twine their roots with stone<br/>In perpendicular places, where the foot<br/>Of man would tremble, could he reach them--yes,<br/>Ye look eternal! Yet, in a few days,<br/>Perhaps even hours, ye will be changed, rent, hurled<br/>Before the mass of waters; and yon cave,<br/>Which seems to lead into a lower world,<br/>Shall have its depths searched by the sweeping wave,<br/>And dolphins gambol in the lion's den!<br/>And man----Oh, men! my fellow-beings! Who<br/>Shall weep above your universal grave,<br/>Save I? Who shall be left to weep? My kinsmen,<br/>Alas! what am I better than ye are,<br/>That I must live beyond ye? Where shall be<br/>The pleasant places where I thought of Anah<br/>While I had hope? or the more savage haunts,<br/>Scarce less beloved, where I despaired for her?<br/>And can it be!--Shall yon exulting peak,<br/>Whose glittering top is like a distant star,<br/>Lie low beneath the boiling of the deep?<br/>No more to have the morning sun break forth,<br/>And scatter back the mists in floating folds<br/>From its tremendous brow? no more to have<br/>Day's broad orb drop behind its head at even,<br/>Leaving it with a crown of many hues?<br/>No more to be the beacon of the world,<br/>For angels to alight on, as the spot<br/>Nearest the stars? And can those words "_no more_"<br/>Be meant for thee, for all things, save for us,<br/>And the predestined creeping things reserved<br/>By my sire to Jehovah's bidding? May<br/>_He_ preserve _them_, and I _not_ have the power<br/>To snatch the loveliest of earth's daughters from<br/>A doom which even some serpent, with his mate,<br/>Shall 'scape to save his kind to be prolonged,<br/>To hiss and sting through some emerging world,<br/>Reeking and dank from out the slime, whose ooze<br/>Shall slumber o'er the wreck of this, until<br/>The salt morass subside into a sphere<br/>Beneath the sun, and be the monument,<br/>The sole and undistinguished sepulchre,<br/>Of yet quick myriads of all life? How much<br/>Breath will be stilled at once! All beauteous world!<br/>So young, so marked out for destruction, I<br/>With a cleft heart look on thee day by day,<br/>And night by night, thy numbered days and nights.<br/>I cannot save thee, cannot save even her<br/>Whose love had made me love thee more; but as<br/>A portion of thy dust, I cannot think<br/>Upon thy coming doom without a feeling<br/>Such as--Oh God! and canst thou--                        [_He pauses_.<br/><br/>               [_A rushing sound from the cavern is heard, and shouts<br/>                      of laughter--afterwards a Spirit passes_.<br/><br/>_Japh._                             In the name<br/>Of the Most High, what art thou?<br/><br/>_Spirit_ (_laughs_).             Ha! ha! ha!<br/><br/>_Japh._ By all that earth holds holiest, speak!<br/><br/>_Spirit_ (_laughs_).

Whate'er our God decrees,<br/>The God of Seth as Cain, I must obey,<br/>And will endeavour patiently to obey.<br/>But could I dare to pray in his dread hour<br/>Of universal vengeance (if such should be),<br/>It would not be to live, alone exempt<br/>Of all my house. My sister! oh, my sister!<br/>What were the world, or other worlds, or all<br/>The brightest future, without the sweet past--<br/>Thy love, my father's, all the life, and all<br/>The things which sprang up with me, like the stars,<br/>Making my dim existence radiant with<br/>Soft lights which were not mine? Aholibamah!<br/>Oh! if there should be mercy--seek it, find it:<br/>I abhor Death, because that thou must die.<br/><br/>_Aho._ What, hath this dreamer, with his father's ark,<br/>The bugbear he hath built to scare the world,<br/>Shaken _my_ sister?

Ah! smilest thou still in scorn?<br/>Turn to thy Seraphs: if they attest it not,<br/>They are none.<br/><br/>_Sam._        Aholibamah, own thy God!<br/><br/>_Aho._ I have ever hailed our Maker, Samiasa,<br/>As thine, and mine: a God of Love, not Sorrow.<br/><br/>_Japh._ Alas! what else is Love but Sorrow? Even<br/>He who made earth in love had soon to grieve<br/>Above its first and best inhabitants.<br/><br/>_Aho._ 'Tis said so.<br/><br/>_Japh._              It is even so.<br/><br/>                     _Enter_ NOAH _and_ SHEM.<br/><br/>_Noah_.                             Japhet! What<br/>Dost thou here with these children of the wicked?<br/>Dread'st thou not to partake their coming doom?<br/><br/>_Japh._ Father, it cannot be a sin to seek<br/>To save an earth-born being; and behold,<br/>These are not of the sinful, since they have<br/>The fellowship of angels.<br/><br/>_Noah_.                   These are they, then,<br/>Who leave the throne of God, to take them wives<br/>From out the race of Cain; the sons of Heaven,<br/>Who seek Earth's daughters for their beauty?<br/><br/>_Aza._                                      Patriarch!<br/>Thou hast said it.<br/><br/>_Noah_.            Woe, woe, woe to such communion!<br/>Has not God made a barrier between Earth<br/>And Heaven, and limited each, kind to kind?<br/><br/>_Sam._ Was not man made in high Jehovah's image?<br/>Did God not love what he had made? And what<br/>Do we but imitate and emulate<br/>His love unto created love?<br/><br/>_Noah_.                    I am<br/>But man, and was not made to judge mankind,<br/>Far less the sons of God; but as our God<br/>Has deigned to commune with me, and reveal<br/>_His_ judgments, I reply, that the descent<br/>Of Seraphs from their everlasting seat<br/>Unto a perishable and perishing,<br/>Even on the very _eve_ of _perishing_?--world,<br/>Cannot be good.<br/><br/>_Aza._          What! though it were to save?<br/><br/>_Noah_. Not ye in all your glory can redeem<br/>What he who made you glorious hath condemned.<br/>Were your immortal mission safety, 'twould<br/>Be general, not for two, though beautiful;<br/>And beautiful they are, but not the less<br/>Condemned.<br/><br/>_Japh._    Oh, father! say it not.<br/><br/>_Noah_.                            Son! son!<br/>If that thou wouldst avoid their doom, forget<br/>That they exist: they soon shall cease to be,<br/>While thou shalt be the sire of a new world,<br/>And better.<br/><br/>_Japh._     Let me die with _this_, and _them_!<br/><br/>_Noah_. Thou _shouldst_ for such a thought, but shalt not: he<br/>Who _can_, redeems thee.<br/><br/>_Sam._                    And why him and thee,<br/>More than what he, thy son, prefers to both?<br/><br/>_Noah_. Ask him who made thee greater than myself<br/>And mine, but not less subject to his own<br/>Almightiness. And lo! his mildest and<br/>Least to be tempted messenger appears!<br/><br/>              _Enter_ RAPHAEL _the Archangel_.<br/><br/>_Raph._<br/>                Spirits!<br/>        Whose seat is near the throne,<br/>            What do ye here?<br/>    Is thus a Seraph's duty to be shown,<br/>           Now that the hour is near<br/>       When Earth must be alone?<br/>                Return!<br/>            Adore and burn,<br/>  In glorious homage with the elected "Seven."<br/>            Your place is Heaven.<br/><br/>_Sam._<br/>                 Raphael!<br/>  The first and fairest of the sons of God,<br/>            How long hath this been law,<br/>  That Earth by angels must be left untrod?<br/>            Earth! which oft saw<br/>  Jehovah's footsteps not disdain her sod!<br/>      The world he loved, and made<br/>      For love; and oft have we obeyed<br/>  His frequent mission with delighted pinions:<br/>      Adoring him in his least works displayed;<br/>  Watching this youngest star of his dominions;<br/>      And, as the latest birth of his great word,<br/>      Eager to keep it worthy of our Lord.<br/>            Why is thy brow severe?<br/>  And wherefore speak'st thou of destruction near?<br/><br/>_Raph._<br/>        Had Samiasa and Azaziel been<br/>    In their true place, with the angelic choir,<br/>                Written in fire<br/>              They would have seen<br/>              Jehovah's late decree,<br/>  And not enquired their Maker's breath of me:<br/>              But ignorance must ever be<br/>                A part of sin;<br/>  And even the Spirits' knowledge shall grow less<br/>              As they wax proud within;<br/>  For Blindness is the first-born of Excess.<br/>    When all good angels left the world, ye stayed,<br/>  Stung with strange passions, and debased<br/>    By mortal feelings for a mortal maid:<br/>  But ye are pardoned thus far, and replaced<br/>  With your pure equals. Hence! away! away!<br/>                 Or stay,<br/>  And lose Eternity by that delay!<br/><br/>_Aza._<br/>        And thou! if Earth be thus forbidden<br/>                In the decree<br/>          To us until this moment hidden,<br/>                Dost thou not err as we<br/>                  In being here?<br/><br/>_Raph._<br/>  I came to call ye back to your fit sphere,<br/>    In the great name and at the word of God,<br/>  Dear, dearest in themselves, and scarce less dear--<br/>    That which I came to do: till now we trod<br/>  Together the eternal space; together<br/>    Let us still walk the stars. True, Earth must die!<br/>  Her race, returned into her womb, must wither,<br/>    And much which she inherits: but oh! why<br/>    Cannot this Earth be made, or be destroyed,<br/>    Without involving ever some vast void<br/>  In the immortal ranks? immortal still<br/>    In their immeasurable forfeiture.<br/>  Our brother Satan fell; his burning will<br/>    Rather than longer worship dared endure!<br/>    But ye who still are pure!<br/>  Seraphs! less mighty than that mightiest one,--<br/>    Think how he was undone!<br/>  And think if tempting man can compensate<br/>    For Heaven desired too late?<br/>          Long have I warred,<br/>          Long must I war<br/>      With him who deemed it hard<br/>  To be created, and to acknowledge him<br/>  Who midst the cherubim<br/>    Made him as suns to a dependent star,<br/>  Leaving the archangels at his right hand dim.<br/>      I loved him--beautiful he was: oh, Heaven!<br/>  Save _his_ who made, what beauty and what power<br/>  Was ever like to Satan's! Would the hour<br/>      In which he fell could ever be forgiven!<br/>  The wish is impious: but, oh ye!<br/>  Yet undestroyed, be warned! Eternity<br/>    With him, or with his God, is in your choice:<br/>  He hath not tempted you; he cannot tempt<br/>  The angels, from his further snares exempt:<br/>    But man hath listened to his voice,<br/>  And ye to woman's--beautiful she is,<br/>  The serpent's voice less subtle than her kiss.<br/>  The snake but vanquished dust; but she will draw<br/>  A second host from heaven, to break Heaven's law.<br/>                Yet, yet, oh fly!<br/>                Ye cannot die;<br/>                But they<br/>                Shall pass away,<br/>  While ye shall fill with shrieks the upper sky<br/>      For perishable clay,<br/>  Whose memory in your immortality<br/>      Shall long outlast the Sun which gave them day.<br/>  Think how your essence differeth from theirs<br/>  In all but suffering! why partake<br/>  The agony to which they must be heirs--<br/>  Born to be ploughed with years, and sown with cares,<br/>    And reaped by Death, lord of the human soil?<br/>  Even had their days been left to toil their path<br/>  Through time to dust, unshortened by God's wrath,<br/>    Still they are Evil's prey, and Sorrow's spoil.<br/><br/>_Aho._<br/>                Let them fly!<br/>  I hear the voice which says that all must die,<br/>  Sooner than our white-bearded patriarchs died;<br/>                And that on high<br/>              An ocean is prepared,<br/>                While from below<br/>  The deep shall rise to meet Heaven's overflow--<br/>              Few shall be spared,<br/>  It seems; and, of that few, the race of Cain<br/>  Must lift their eyes to Adam's God in vain.<br/>              Sister! since it is so,<br/>            And the eternal Lord<br/>          In vain would be implored<br/>      For the remission of one hour of woe,<br/>  Let us resign even what we have adored,<br/>  And meet the wave, as we would meet the sword,<br/>      If not unmoved, yet undismayed,<br/>  And wailing less for us than those who shall<br/>  Survive in mortal or immortal thrall,<br/>      And, when the fatal waters are allayed,<br/>  Weep for the myriads who can weep no more.<br/>  Fly, Seraphs! to your own eternal shore,<br/>  Where winds nor howl, nor waters roar.<br/>        Our portion is to die,<br/>      And yours to live for ever:<br/>    But which is best, a dead Eternity,<br/>  Or living, is but known to the great Giver.<br/>        Obey him, as we shall obey;<br/>    I would not keep this life of mine in clay<br/>        An hour beyond his will;<br/>  Nor see ye lose a portion of his grace,<br/>  For all the mercy which Seth's race<br/>              Find still.<br/>                  Fly!<br/>    And as your pinions bear ye back to Heaven,<br/>  Think that my love still mounts with thee on high,<br/>                Samiasa!<br/>  And if I look up with a tearless eye,<br/>    'Tis that an angel's bride disdains to weep,--<br/>    Farewell! Now rise, inexorable deep!<br/><br/>_Anah_.<br/>                And must we die?<br/>              And must I lose thee too,<br/>                  Azaziel?<br/>            Oh, my heart! my heart!<br/>              Thy prophecies were true!<br/>            And yet thou wert so happy too!<br/>    The blow, though not unlocked for, falls as new:<br/>                But yet depart!<br/>                    Ah! why?<br/>        Yet let me not retain thee--fly!<br/>     My pangs can be but brief; but thine would be<br/>     Eternal, if repulsed from Heaven for me.<br/>         Too much already hast thou deigned<br/>             To one of Adam's race!<br/>  Our doom is sorrow: not to us alone,<br/>    But to the Spirits who have not disdained<br/>  To love us, cometh anguish with disgrace.<br/>  The first who taught us knowledge hath been hurled<br/>    From his once archangelic throne<br/>    Into some unknown world:<br/>         And thou, Azaziel! No--<br/>         Thou shall not suffer woe<br/>  For me. Away! nor weep!<br/>    Thou canst not weep; but yet<br/>    May'st suffer more, not weeping: then forget<br/>  Her, whom the surges of the all-strangling deep<br/>  Can bring no pang like this. Fly! fly!<br/>  Being gone, 'twill be less difficult to die.<br/><br/>_Japh._<br/>            Oh say not so!<br/>          Father! and thou, archangel, thou!<br/>    Surely celestial mercy lurks below<br/>  That pure severe serenity of brow:<br/>    Let them not meet this sea without a shore,<br/>    Save in our ark, or let me be no more!<br/><br/>_Noah_.<br/>      Peace, child of passion, peace!<br/>  If not within thy heart, yet with thy tongue<br/>      Do God no wrong!<br/>  Live as he wills it--die, when he ordains,<br/>  A righteous death, unlike the seed of Cain's.<br/>    Cease, or be sorrowful in silence; cease<br/>  To weary Heaven's ear with thy selfish plaint.<br/>    Wouldst thou have God commit a sin for thee?<br/>            Such would it be<br/>         To alter his intent<br/>  For a mere mortal sorrow. Be a man!<br/>  And bear what Adam's race must bear, and can.<br/><br/>_Japh._<br/>      Aye, father! but when they are gone,<br/>        And we are all alone,<br/>  Floating upon the azure desert, and<br/>  The depth beneath us hides our own dear land,<br/>    And dearer, silent friends and brethren, all<br/>    Buried in its immeasurable breast,<br/>  Who, who, our tears, our shrieks, shall then command?<br/>    Can we in Desolation's peace have rest?<br/>      Oh God! be thou a God, and spare<br/>        Yet while 'tis time!<br/>      Renew not Adam's fall:<br/>    Mankind were then but twain,<br/>  But they are numerous now as are the waves<br/>        And the tremendous rain,<br/>  Whose drops shall be less thick than would their graves,<br/>    Were graves permitted to the seed of Cain.<br/><br/>_Noah_. Silence, vain boy! each word of thine's a crime.<br/>Angel! forgive this stripling's fond despair.<br/><br/>_Raph._ Seraphs! these mortals speak in passion: Ye!<br/>Who are, or should be, passionless and pure,<br/>May now return with me.<br/><br/>_Sam._                  It may not be:<br/>We have chosen, and will endure.<br/><br/>_Raph._ Say'st thou?<br/><br/>_Aza._               He hath said it, and I say, Amen!<br/><br/>_Raph._<br/>            Again!<br/>      Then from this hour,<br/>      Shorn as ye are of all celestial power,<br/>  And aliens from your God,<br/>            Farewell!<br/><br/>_Japh._             Alas! where shall they dwell?<br/>Hark, hark!

Hark, hark! the sea-birds cry!<br/>  In clouds they overspread the lurid sky,<br/>And hover round the mountain, where before<br/>  Never a white wing, wetted by the wave,<br/>      Yet dared to soar,<br/>  Even when the waters waxed too fierce to brave.<br/>      Soon it shall be their only shore,<br/>      And then, no more!<br/><br/>_Japh._ The sun! the sun!<br/>He riseth, but his better light is gone;<br/>        And a black circle, bound<br/>        His glaring disk around,<br/>Proclaims Earth's last of summer days hath shone!<br/>      The clouds return into the hues of night,<br/>Save where their brazen-coloured edges streak<br/>The verge where brighter morns were wont to break.<br/><br/>_Noah_.

Then die<br/>                       With them!<br/>How darest thou look on that prophetic sky,<br/>And seek to save what all things now condemn,<br/>        In overwhelming unison<br/>              With just Jehovah's wrath!<br/><br/>_Japh._ Can rage and justice join in the same path?<br/><br/>_Noah_. Blasphemer! darest thou murmur even now!<br/><br/>_Raph._ Patriarch, be still a father! smooth thy brow:<br/>Thy son, despite his folly, shall not sink:<br/>He knows not what he says, yet shall not drink<br/>  With sobs the salt foam of the swelling waters;<br/>But be, when passion passeth, good as thou,<br/>  Nor perish like Heaven's children with man's daughters.<br/><br/>_Aho._ The tempest cometh; heaven and earth unite<br/>    For the annihilation of all life.<br/>    Unequal is the strife<br/>Between our strength and the Eternal Might!<br/><br/>_Sam._ But ours is with thee; we will bear ye far<br/>  To some untroubled star,<br/>Where thou, and Anah, shalt partake our lot:<br/>  And if thou dost not weep for thy lost earth,<br/>Our forfeit Heaven shall also be forgot.<br/><br/>_Anah_.

Yet spare!<br/>Hark! even the forest beasts howl forth their prayer!<br/>  The dragon crawls from out his den,<br/>  To herd, in terror, innocent with men;<br/>And the birds scream their agony through air.<br/>Yet, yet, Jehovah! yet withdraw thy rod<br/>Of wrath, and pity thine own world's despair!<br/>Hear not man only but all nature plead!<br/><br/>_Raph._ Farewell, thou earth! ye wretched sons of clay,<br/>I cannot, must not, aid you.
