  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To Helen by *Edgar Allan Poe*

<p>
    I saw thee once--once only--years ago:<br/>I must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.<br/>It was a July midnight; and from out<br/>A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,<br/>Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,<br/>There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,<br/>With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,<br/>Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand<br/>Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,<br/>Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--<br/>Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses<br/>That gave out, in return for the love-light,<br/>Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--<br/>Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses<br/>That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted<br/>By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.<br/><br/>Clad all in white, upon a violet bank<br/>I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon<br/>Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,<br/>And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!<br/><br/>Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--<br/>Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),<br/>That bade me pause before that garden-gate,<br/>To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?<br/>No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,<br/>Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!<br/>How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--<br/>Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--<br/>And in an instant all things disappeared.<br/>(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)<br/>The pearly lustre of the moon went out:<br/>The mossy banks and the meandering paths,<br/>The happy flowers and the repining trees,<br/>Were seen no more: the very roses' odors<br/>Died in the arms of the adoring airs.<br/>All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:<br/>Save only the divine light in thine eyes--<br/>Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.<br/>I saw but them--they were the world to me.<br/>I saw but them--saw only them for hours--<br/>Saw only them until the moon went down.<br/>What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten<br/>Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!<br/>How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!<br/>How silently serene a sea of pride!<br/>How daring an ambition! yet how deep--<br/>How fathomless a capacity for love!<br/><br/>But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,<br/>Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;<br/>And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees<br/>Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._<br/>They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.<br/>Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,<br/>_They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.<br/>They follow me--they lead me through the years.<br/><br/>They are my ministers--yet I their slave.<br/>Their office is to illumine and enkindle--<br/>My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,<br/>And purified in their electric fire,<br/>And sanctified in their elysian fire.<br/>They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),<br/>And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to<br/>In the sad, silent watches of my night;<br/>While even in the meridian glare of day<br/>I see them still--two sweetly scintillant<br/>Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!
