<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Endymion: Book III by *John Keats*

<p>
    There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men<br/>With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen<br/>Their baaing vanities, to browse away<br/>The comfortable green and juicy hay<br/>From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!<br/>Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd<br/>Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe<br/>Our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge<br/>Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight<br/>Able to face an owl's, they still are dight<br/>By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,<br/>And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,<br/>Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount<br/>To their spirit's perch, their being's high account,<br/>Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones--<br/>Amid the fierce intoxicating tones<br/>Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,<br/>And sudden cannon. Ah! how all this hums,<br/>In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone--<br/>Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,<br/>And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.--<br/>Are then regalities all gilded masks?<br/>No, there are throned seats unscalable<br/>But by a patient wing, a constant spell,<br/>Or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,<br/>Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,<br/>And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents<br/>To watch the abysm-birth of elements.<br/>Aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate<br/>A thousand Powers keep religious state,<br/>In water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;<br/>And, silent as a consecrated urn,<br/>Hold sphery sessions for a season due.<br/>Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!<br/>Have bared their operations to this globe--<br/>Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe<br/>Our piece of heaven--whose benevolence<br/>Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense<br/>Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,<br/>As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud<br/>'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,<br/>Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair<br/>Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.<br/>When thy gold breath is misting in the west,<br/>She unobserved steals unto her throne,<br/>And there she sits most meek and most alone;<br/>As if she had not pomp subservient;<br/>As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent<br/>Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;<br/>As if the ministring stars kept not apart,<br/>Waiting for silver-footed messages.<br/>O Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees<br/>Feel palpitations when thou lookest in:<br/>O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din<br/>The while they feel thine airy fellowship.<br/>Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip<br/>Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,<br/>Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:<br/>Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,<br/>Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;<br/>And yet thy benediction passeth not<br/>One obscure hiding-place, one little spot<br/>Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren<br/>Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,<br/>And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf<br/>Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief<br/>To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps<br/>Within its pearly house.--The mighty deeps,<br/>The monstrous sea is thine--the myriad sea!<br/>O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,<br/>And Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.<br/><br/>  Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode<br/>Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine<br/>Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine<br/>For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale<br/>For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail<br/>His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?<br/>Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,<br/>Or what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!<br/>How chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!<br/>She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness<br/>Is wan on Neptune's blue: yet there's a stress<br/>Of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,<br/>Dancing upon the waves, as if to please<br/>The curly foam with amorous influence.<br/>O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence<br/>She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about<br/>O'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out<br/>The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning<br/>Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.<br/>Where will the splendor be content to reach?<br/>O love! how potent hast thou been to teach<br/>Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,<br/>In gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,<br/>In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,<br/>Thou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won.<br/>Amid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;<br/>Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;<br/>Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;<br/>And now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent<br/>A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,<br/>To find Endymion.<br/><br/>                  On gold sand impearl'd<br/>With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,<br/>Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light<br/>Against his pallid face: he felt the charm<br/>To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm<br/>Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd<br/>His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid<br/>His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,<br/>To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,<br/>Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.<br/>And so he kept, until the rosy veils<br/>Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand<br/>Were lifted from the water's breast, and fann'd<br/>Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came<br/>Meekly through billows:--when like taper-flame<br/>Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,<br/>He rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare<br/>Along his fated way.<br/><br/>                      Far had he roam'd,<br/>With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd<br/>Above, around, and at his feet; save things<br/>More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:<br/>Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large<br/>Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;<br/>Rudders that for a hundred years had lost<br/>The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd<br/>With long-forgotten story, and wherein<br/>No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin<br/>But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,<br/>Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls<br/>Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude<br/>In ponderous stone, developing the mood<br/>Of ancient Nox;--then skeletons of man,<br/>Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,<br/>And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw<br/>Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe<br/>These secrets struck into him; and unless<br/>Dian had chaced away that heaviness,<br/>He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,<br/>He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal<br/>About the labyrinth in his soul of love.<br/><br/>  "What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move<br/>My heart so potently? When yet a child<br/>I oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.<br/>Thou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went<br/>From eve to morn across the firmament.<br/>No apples would I gather from the tree,<br/>Till thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:<br/>No tumbling water ever spake romance,<br/>But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:<br/>No woods were green enough, no bower divine,<br/>Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:<br/>In sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,<br/>Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;<br/>And, in the summer tide of blossoming,<br/>No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing<br/>And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.<br/>No melody was like a passing spright<br/>If it went not to solemnize thy reign.<br/>Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain<br/>By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;<br/>And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend<br/>With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;<br/>Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--<br/>The poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;<br/>Thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;<br/>Thou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--<br/>My goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--<br/>Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!<br/>O what a wild and harmonized tune<br/>My spirit struck from all the beautiful!<br/>On some bright essence could I lean, and lull<br/>Myself to immortality: I prest<br/>Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.<br/>But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--<br/>My strange love came--Felicity's abyss!<br/>She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--<br/>Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway<br/>Has been an under-passion to this hour.<br/>Now I begin to feel thine orby power<br/>Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,<br/>Keep back thine influence, and do not blind<br/>My sovereign vision.--Dearest love, forgive<br/>That I can think away from thee and live!--<br/>Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize<br/>One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!<br/>How far beyond!" At this a surpris'd start<br/>Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;<br/>For as he lifted up his eyes to swear<br/>How his own goddess was past all things fair,<br/>He saw far in the concave green of the sea<br/>An old man sitting calm and peacefully.<br/>Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,<br/>And his white hair was awful, and a mat<br/>Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;<br/>And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,<br/>A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,<br/>O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans<br/>Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form<br/>Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,<br/>And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar<br/>Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape<br/>That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.<br/>The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,<br/>Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell<br/>To its huge self; and the minutest fish<br/>Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,<br/>And show his little eye's anatomy.<br/>Then there was pictur'd the regality<br/>Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,<br/>In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.<br/>Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,<br/>And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd<br/>So stedfastly, that the new denizen<br/>Had time to keep him in amazed ken,<br/>To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.<br/><br/>  The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw<br/>The wilder'd stranger--seeming not to see,<br/>His features were so lifeless. Suddenly<br/>He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows<br/>Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs<br/>Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,<br/>Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,<br/>Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.<br/>Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil<br/>Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,<br/>Who had not from mid-life to utmost age<br/>Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,<br/>Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,<br/>With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,<br/>And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd<br/>Echo into oblivion, he said:--<br/><br/>  "Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head<br/>In peace upon my watery pillow: now<br/>Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.<br/>O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!<br/>O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung<br/>With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,<br/>When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--<br/>I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen<br/>Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;<br/>Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,<br/>That writhes about the roots of Sicily:<br/>To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,<br/>And mount upon the snortings of a whale<br/>To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep<br/>On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,<br/>Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd<br/>With rapture to the other side of the world!<br/>O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,<br/>I bow full hearted to your old decree!<br/>Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,<br/>For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.<br/>Thou art the man!" Endymion started back<br/>Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack<br/>Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,<br/>Mutter'd: "What lonely death am I to die<br/>In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,<br/>And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?<br/>Or will he touch me with his searing hand,<br/>And leave a black memorial on the sand?<br/>Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,<br/>And keep me as a chosen food to draw<br/>His magian fish through hated fire and flame?<br/>O misery of hell! resistless, tame,<br/>Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,<br/>Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!--<br/>O Tartarus! but some few days agone<br/>Her soft arms were entwining me, and on<br/>Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:<br/>Her lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves<br/>Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,<br/>But never may be garner'd. I must stoop<br/>My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!<br/>Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell<br/>Would melt at thy sweet breath.--By Dian's hind<br/>Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind<br/>I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,<br/>I care not for this old mysterious man!"<br/><br/>  He spake, and walking to that aged form,<br/>Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm<br/>With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.<br/>Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?<br/>Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought<br/>Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,<br/>Convulsion to a mouth of many years?<br/>He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.<br/>The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt<br/>Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt<br/>About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:<br/><br/>  "Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus' sake!<br/>I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel<br/>A very brother's yearning for thee steal<br/>Into mine own: for why? thou openest<br/>The prison gates that have so long opprest<br/>My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,<br/>Thou art commission'd to this fated spot<br/>For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;<br/>I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:<br/>Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power<br/>I had been grieving at this joyous hour<br/>But even now most miserable old,<br/>I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold<br/>Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case<br/>Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays<br/>As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,<br/>For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,<br/>Now as we speed towards our joyous task."<br/><br/>  So saying, this young soul in age's mask<br/>Went forward with the Carian side by side:<br/>Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide<br/>Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands<br/>Took silently their foot-prints. "My soul stands<br/>Now past the midway from mortality,<br/>And so I can prepare without a sigh<br/>To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.<br/>I was a fisher once, upon this main,<br/>And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;<br/>Rough billows were my home by night and day,--<br/>The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had<br/>No housing from the storm and tempests mad,<br/>But hollow rocks,--and they were palaces<br/>Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:<br/>Long years of misery have told me so.<br/>Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.<br/>One thousand years!--Is it then possible<br/>To look so plainly through them? to dispel<br/>A thousand years with backward glance sublime?<br/>To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime<br/>From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,<br/>And one's own image from the bottom peep?<br/>Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,<br/>My long captivity and moanings all<br/>Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,<br/>The which I breathe away, and thronging come<br/>Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.<br/><br/>  "I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:<br/>I was a lonely youth on desert shores.<br/>My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,<br/>And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry<br/>Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.<br/>Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen<br/>Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,<br/>Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,<br/>When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft<br/>Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe<br/>To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe<br/>My life away like a vast sponge of fate,<br/>Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,<br/>Has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,<br/>And left me tossing safely. But the crown<br/>Of all my life was utmost quietude:<br/>More did I love to lie in cavern rude,<br/>Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,<br/>And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!<br/>There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer<br/>My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear<br/>The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,<br/>Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:<br/>And never was a day of summer shine,<br/>But I beheld its birth upon the brine:<br/>For I would watch all night to see unfold<br/>Heaven's gates, and Aethon snort his morning gold<br/>Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly<br/>At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,<br/>My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.<br/>The poor folk of the sea-country I blest<br/>With daily boon of fish most delicate:<br/>They knew not whence this bounty, and elate<br/>Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.<br/><br/>  "Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach<br/>At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!<br/>Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began<br/>To feel distemper'd longings: to desire<br/>The utmost privilege that ocean's sire<br/>Could grant in benediction: to be free<br/>Of all his kingdom. Long in misery<br/>I wasted, ere in one extremest fit<br/>I plung'd for life or death. To interknit<br/>One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff<br/>Might seem a work of pain; so not enough<br/>Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,<br/>And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt<br/>Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;<br/>Forgetful utterly of self-intent;<br/>Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.<br/>Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew<br/>His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,<br/>I tried in fear the pinions of my will.<br/>'Twas freedom! and at once I visited<br/>The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.<br/>No need to tell thee of them, for I see<br/>That thou hast been a witness--it must be<br/>For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,<br/>By the melancholy corners of that mouth.<br/>So I will in my story straightway pass<br/>To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!<br/>That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!<br/>Why did poor Glaucus ever--ever dare<br/>To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!<br/>I lov'd her to the very white of truth,<br/>And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!<br/>She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,<br/>Round every isle, and point, and promontory,<br/>From where large Hercules wound up his story<br/>Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew<br/>The more, the more I saw her dainty hue<br/>Gleam delicately through the azure clear:<br/>Until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;<br/>And in that agony, across my grief<br/>It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief--<br/>Cruel enchantress! So above the water<br/>I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter.<br/>Aeaea's isle was wondering at the moon:--<br/>It seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon<br/>Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.<br/><br/>  "When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;<br/>Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,<br/>Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.<br/>How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,<br/>And over it a sighing voice expire.<br/>It ceased--I caught light footsteps; and anon<br/>The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon<br/>Push'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!<br/>With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove<br/>A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all<br/>The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall<br/>The dew of her rich speech: "Ah! Art awake?<br/>O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!<br/>I am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed<br/>An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;<br/>And now I find thee living, I will pour<br/>From these devoted eyes their silver store,<br/>Until exhausted of the latest drop,<br/>So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop<br/>Here, that I too may live: but if beyond<br/>Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond<br/>Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;<br/>If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;<br/>If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,<br/>Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,<br/>O let me pluck it for thee." Thus she link'd<br/>Her charming syllables, till indistinct<br/>Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;<br/>And then she hover'd over me, and stole<br/>So near, that if no nearer it had been<br/>This furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.<br/><br/>  "Young man of Latmos! thus particular<br/>Am I, that thou may'st plainly see how far<br/>This fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not<br/>Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?<br/><br/>  "Who could resist? Who in this universe?<br/>She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse<br/>My fine existence in a golden clime.<br/>She took me like a child of suckling time,<br/>And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,<br/>The current of my former life was stemm'd,<br/>And to this arbitrary queen of sense<br/>I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence<br/>Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd<br/>Me back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.<br/>For as Apollo each eve doth devise<br/>A new appareling for western skies;<br/>So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour<br/>Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.<br/>And I was free of haunts umbrageous;<br/>Could wander in the mazy forest-house<br/>Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,<br/>And birds from coverts innermost and drear<br/>Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow--<br/>To me new born delights!<br/><br/>                          "Now let me borrow,<br/>For moments few, a temperament as stern<br/>As Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn<br/>These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell<br/>How specious heaven was changed to real hell.<br/><br/>  "One morn she left me sleeping: half awake<br/>I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake<br/>My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;<br/>But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts<br/>Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,<br/>That out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.<br/>Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom<br/>Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom<br/>A sound of moan, an agony of sound,<br/>Sepulchral from the distance all around.<br/>Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled<br/>That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled<br/>Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd.<br/>I came to a dark valley.--Groanings swell'd<br/>Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,<br/>The nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,<br/>That glar'd before me through a thorny brake.<br/>This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,<br/>Bewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near<br/>A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:<br/>In thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene--<br/>The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,<br/>Seated upon an uptorn forest root;<br/>And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,<br/>Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,<br/>Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!<br/>O such deformities! Old Charon's self,<br/>Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,<br/>And take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,<br/>It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,<br/>And tyrannizing was the lady's look,<br/>As over them a gnarled staff she shook.<br/>Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,<br/>And from a basket emptied to the rout<br/>Clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick<br/>And roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick<br/>About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,<br/>Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,<br/>And emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:<br/>Groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial<br/>Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.<br/>She lifted up the charm: appealing groans<br/>From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear<br/>In vain; remorseless as an infant's bier<br/>She whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.<br/>Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,<br/>Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,<br/>Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;<br/>Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat<br/>And puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:<br/>Then was appalling silence: then a sight<br/>More wildering than all that hoarse affright;<br/>For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,<br/>Went through the dismal air like one huge Python<br/>Antagonizing Boreas,--and so vanish'd.<br/>Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd<br/>These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark<br/>Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,<br/>With dancing and loud revelry,--and went<br/>Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.--<br/>Sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd<br/>Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud<br/>In human accent: "Potent goddess! chief<br/>Of pains resistless! make my being brief,<br/>Or let me from this heavy prison fly:<br/>Or give me to the air, or let me die!<br/>I sue not for my happy crown again;<br/>I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;<br/>I sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;<br/>I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,<br/>My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!<br/>I will forget them; I will pass these joys;<br/>Ask nought so heavenward, so too--too high:<br/>Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,<br/>Or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,<br/>From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,<br/>And merely given to the cold bleak air.<br/>Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"<br/><br/>  That curst magician's name fell icy numb<br/>Upon my wild conjecturing: truth had come<br/>Naked and sabre-like against my heart.<br/>I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;<br/>And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,<br/>Fainted away in that dark lair of night.<br/>Think, my deliverer, how desolate<br/>My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,<br/>And terrors manifold divided me<br/>A spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee<br/>Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:<br/>I fled three days--when lo! before me stood<br/>Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,<br/>A clammy dew is beading on my brow,<br/>At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.<br/>"Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse<br/>Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,<br/>To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,<br/>I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:<br/>My tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.<br/>So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies<br/>Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries<br/>Upon some breast more lily-feminine.<br/>Oh, no--it shall not pine, and pine, and pine<br/>More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;<br/>And then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears<br/>Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!<br/>Young dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt<br/>One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,<br/>That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.<br/>And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.<br/>Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,<br/>Let me sob over thee my last adieus,<br/>And speak a blessing: Mark me! thou hast thews<br/>Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:<br/>But such a love is mine, that here I chase<br/>Eternally away from thee all bloom<br/>Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.<br/>Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;<br/>And there, ere many days be overpast,<br/>Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then<br/>Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;<br/>But live and wither, cripple and still breathe<br/>Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath<br/>Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.<br/>Adieu, sweet love, adieu!"--As shot stars fall,<br/>She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung<br/>And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung<br/>A war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.<br/>A hand was at my shoulder to compel<br/>My sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes<br/>Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise<br/>Enforced, at the last by ocean's foam<br/>I found me; by my fresh, my native home.<br/>Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,<br/>Came salutary as I waded in;<br/>And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave<br/>Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave<br/>Large froth before me, while there yet remain'd<br/>Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.<br/><br/>  "Young lover, I must weep--such hellish spite<br/>With dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might<br/>Proving upon this element, dismay'd,<br/>Upon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;<br/>I look'd--'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!<br/>O vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?<br/>Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,<br/>But thou must nip this tender innocent<br/>Because I lov'd her?--Cold, O cold indeed<br/>Were her fair limbs, and like a common weed<br/>The sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was<br/>I clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass<br/>Fleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,<br/>Until there shone a fabric crystalline,<br/>Ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.<br/>Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl<br/>Gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!<br/>'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;<br/>And all around--But wherefore this to thee<br/>Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?--<br/>I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.<br/>My fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread<br/>Met palsy half way: soon these limbs became<br/>Gaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.<br/><br/>  "Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,<br/>Without one hope, without one faintest trace<br/>Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble<br/>Of colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble<br/>Thy brain to loss of reason: and next tell<br/>How a restoring chance came down to quell<br/>One half of the witch in me.                 On a day,<br/>Sitting upon a rock above the spray,<br/>I saw grow up from the horizon's brink<br/>A gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink<br/>Away from me again, as though her course<br/>Had been resum'd in spite of hindering force--<br/>So vanish'd: and not long, before arose<br/>Dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.<br/>Old Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,<br/>But could not: therefore all the billows green<br/>Toss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.<br/>The tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds<br/>In perilous bustle; while upon the deck<br/>Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;<br/>The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:<br/>I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.<br/>O they had all been sav'd but crazed eld<br/>Annull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd<br/>And curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit<br/>Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit<br/>Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,<br/>By one and one, to pale oblivion;<br/>And I was gazing on the surges prone,<br/>With many a scalding tear and many a groan,<br/>When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,<br/>Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.<br/>I knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd<br/>These treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--<br/>I caught a finger: but the downward weight<br/>O'erpowered me--it sank. Then 'gan abate<br/>The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst<br/>The comfortable sun. I was athirst<br/>To search the book, and in the warming air<br/>Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.<br/>Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on<br/>My soul page after page, till well-nigh won<br/>Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,<br/>I read these words, and read again, and tried<br/>My eyes against the heavens, and read again.<br/>O what a load of misery and pain<br/>Each Atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope<br/>Came gold around me, cheering me to cope<br/>Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!<br/>For thou hast brought their promise to an end.<br/><br/>  "In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,<br/>Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch<br/>His loath'd existence through ten centuries,<br/>And then to die alone. Who can devise<br/>A total opposition? No one. So<br/>One million times ocean must ebb and flow,<br/>And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,<br/>These things accomplish'd:--If he utterly<br/>Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds<br/>The meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;<br/>If he explores all forms and substances<br/>Straight homeward to their symbol-essences;<br/>He shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,<br/>He must pursue this task of joy and grief<br/>Most piously;--all lovers tempest-tost,<br/>And in the savage overwhelming lost,<br/>He shall deposit side by side, until<br/>Time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:<br/>Which done, and all these labours ripened,<br/>A youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,<br/>Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct<br/>How to consummate all. The youth elect<br/>Must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd."--<br/><br/>  "Then," cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,<br/>"We are twin brothers in this destiny!<br/>Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high<br/>Is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.<br/>What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,<br/>Had we both perish'd?"--"Look!" the sage replied,<br/>"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,<br/>Of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice<br/>I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;<br/>And where I have enshrined piously<br/>All lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die<br/>Throughout my bondage." Thus discoursing, on<br/>They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;<br/>Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.<br/>Sure never since king Neptune held his state<br/>Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.<br/>Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars<br/>Has legion'd all his battle; and behold<br/>How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold<br/>His even breast: see, many steeled squares,<br/>And rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares<br/>One step? Imagine further, line by line,<br/>These warrior thousands on the field supine:--<br/>So in that crystal place, in silent rows,<br/>Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.--<br/>The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd<br/>Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;<br/>Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips<br/>All ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips.<br/>He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair<br/>Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;<br/>And each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,<br/>Put cross-wise to its heart.<br/><br/>                              "Let us commence,<br/>Whisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now."<br/>He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,<br/>Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,<br/>Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.<br/>He tore it into pieces small as snow<br/>That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;<br/>And having done it, took his dark blue cloak<br/>And bound it round Endymion: then struck<br/>His wand against the empty air times nine.--<br/>"What more there is to do, young man, is thine:<br/>But first a little patience; first undo<br/>This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.<br/>Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;<br/>And shouldst thou break it--What, is it done so clean?<br/>A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!<br/>The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.<br/>Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,<br/>Nor mark'd with any sign or charactery--<br/>Canst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!<br/>Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break<br/>This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal."<br/><br/>  'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall<br/>Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd<br/>A lullaby to silence.--"Youth! now strew<br/>These minced leaves on me, and passing through<br/>Those files of dead, scatter the same around,<br/>And thou wilt see the issue."--'Mid the sound<br/>Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,<br/>Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,<br/>And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.<br/>How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight<br/>Smiling beneath a coral diadem,<br/>Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,<br/>Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,<br/>Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force<br/>Press'd its cold hand, and wept--and Scylla sigh'd!<br/>Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--<br/>The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,<br/>And onward went upon his high employ,<br/>Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.<br/>And, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,<br/>As doth a flower at Apollo's touch.<br/>Death felt it to his inwards; 'twas too much:<br/>Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.<br/>The Latmian persever'd along, and thus<br/>All were re-animated. There arose<br/>A noise of harmony, pulses and throes<br/>Of gladness in the air--while many, who<br/>Had died in mutual arms devout and true,<br/>Sprang to each other madly; and the rest<br/>Felt a high certainty of being blest.<br/>They gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment<br/>Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.<br/>Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,<br/>Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers<br/>Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.<br/>The two deliverers tasted a pure wine<br/>Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.<br/>Speechless they eyed each other, and about<br/>The fair assembly wander'd to and fro,<br/>Distracted with the richest overflow<br/>Of joy that ever pour'd from heaven.<br/><br/>                                    ----"Away!"<br/>Shouted the new-born god; "Follow, and pay<br/>Our piety to Neptunus supreme!"--<br/>Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,<br/>They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,<br/>Through portal columns of a giant size,<br/>Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.<br/>Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,<br/>Down marble steps; pouring as easily<br/>As hour-glass sand--and fast, as you might see<br/>Swallows obeying the south summer's call,<br/>Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.<br/><br/>  Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,<br/>Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,<br/>Just within ken, they saw descending thick<br/>Another multitude. Whereat more quick<br/>Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,<br/>And of those numbers every eye was wet;<br/>For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,<br/>Like what was never heard in all the throes<br/>Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit<br/>To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.<br/><br/>  This mighty consummation made, the host<br/>Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost<br/>Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,<br/>And from the rear diminishing away,--<br/>Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,<br/>"Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!<br/>God Neptune's palaces!" With noise increas'd,<br/>They shoulder'd on towards that brightening east.<br/>At every onward step proud domes arose<br/>In prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows<br/>Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.<br/>Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,<br/>Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.<br/>Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld<br/>By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts<br/>A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts<br/>Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:<br/>For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere<br/>As marble was there lavish, to the vast<br/>Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,<br/>Even for common bulk, those olden three,<br/>Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.<br/><br/>  As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow<br/>Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew<br/>Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch<br/>Through which this Paphian army took its march,<br/>Into the outer courts of Neptune's state:<br/>Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,<br/>To which the leaders sped; but not half raught<br/>Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,<br/>And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes<br/>Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.<br/>Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze<br/>Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,<br/>And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne<br/>Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;<br/>At his right hand stood winged Love, and on<br/>His left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.<br/><br/>  Far as the mariner on highest mast<br/>Can see all round upon the calmed vast,<br/>So wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue<br/>Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew<br/>Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,<br/>Aw'd from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent<br/>Disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;<br/>But sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,<br/>Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering<br/>Death to a human eye: for there did spring<br/>From natural west, and east, and south, and north,<br/>A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth<br/>A gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.<br/>Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread<br/>As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe<br/>Of feather'd Indian darts about, as through<br/>The delicatest air: air verily,<br/>But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:<br/>This palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze<br/>Of deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze<br/>Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,<br/>Globing a golden sphere.<br/><br/>                          They stood in dreams<br/>Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;<br/>The Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;<br/>And the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.<br/>Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed<br/>On all the multitude a nectarous dew.<br/>The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew<br/>Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;<br/>And when they reach'd the throned eminence<br/>She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down<br/>A toying with the doves. Then,--"Mighty crown<br/>And sceptre of this kingdom!" Venus said,<br/>"Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:<br/>Behold!"--Two copious tear-drops instant fell<br/>From the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,<br/>And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.--<br/>"Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands<br/>Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour<br/>I met thee in earth's bosom, all my power<br/>Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet<br/>Escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?<br/>A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,<br/>Or I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,<br/>A humid eye, and steps luxurious,<br/>Where these are new and strange, are ominous.<br/>Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,<br/>When others were all blind; and were I given<br/>To utter secrets, haply I might say<br/>Some pleasant words:--but Love will have his day.<br/>So wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,<br/>Even in the passing of thine honey-moon,<br/>Visit my Cytherea: thou wilt find<br/>Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;<br/>And pray persuade with thee--Ah, I have done,<br/>All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!"--<br/>Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion<br/>Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.<br/><br/>  Meantime a glorious revelry began<br/>Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran<br/>In courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;<br/>And plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd<br/>New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;<br/>The which, in disentangling for their fire,<br/>Pull'd down fresh foliage and coverture<br/>For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,<br/>Flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng<br/>Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,<br/>And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.<br/>In harmless tendril they each other chain'd,<br/>And strove who should be smother'd deepest in<br/>Fresh crush of leaves.<br/><br/>                          O 'tis a very sin<br/>For one so weak to venture his poor verse<br/>In such a place as this. O do not curse,<br/>High Muses! let him hurry to the ending.<br/><br/>  All suddenly were silent. A soft blending<br/>Of dulcet instruments came charmingly;<br/>And then a hymn.<br/><br/>                    "KING of the stormy sea!<br/>Brother of Jove, and co-inheritor<br/>Of elements! Eternally before<br/>Thee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,<br/>At thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock<br/>Its deep foundations, hissing into foam.<br/>All mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home<br/>Of thy capacious bosom ever flow.<br/>Thou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe<br/>Skulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint<br/>Of all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint<br/>When, from thy diadem, a silver gleam<br/>Slants over blue dominion. Thy bright team<br/>Gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along<br/>To bring thee nearer to that golden song<br/>Apollo singeth, while his chariot<br/>Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not<br/>For scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;<br/>And it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,<br/>As newly come of heaven, dost thou sit<br/>To blend and interknit<br/>Subdued majesty with this glad time.<br/>O shell-borne King sublime!<br/>We lay our hearts before thee evermore--<br/>We sing, and we adore!<br/><br/>  "Breathe softly, flutes;<br/>Be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;<br/>Nor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;<br/>Not flowers budding in an April rain,<br/>Nor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,--<br/>No, nor the Eolian twang of Love's own bow,<br/>Can mingle music fit for the soft ear<br/>Of goddess Cytherea!<br/>Yet deign, white Queen of Beauty, thy fair eyes<br/>On our souls' sacrifice.<br/><br/>  "Bright-winged Child!<br/>Who has another care when thou hast smil'd?<br/>Unfortunates on earth, we see at last<br/>All death-shadows, and glooms that overcast<br/>Our spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions.<br/>O sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!<br/>God of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,<br/>And panting bosoms bare!<br/>Dear unseen light in darkness! eclipser<br/>Of light in light! delicious poisoner!<br/>Thy venom'd goblet will we quaff until<br/>We fill--we fill!<br/>And by thy Mother's lips----"<br/><br/><br/>                         Was heard no more<br/>For clamour, when the golden palace door<br/>Opened again, and from without, in shone<br/>A new magnificence. On oozy throne<br/>Smooth-moving came Oceanus the old,<br/>To take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,<br/>Before he went into his quiet cave<br/>To muse for ever--Then a lucid wave,<br/>Scoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,<br/>Afloat, and pillowing up the majesty<br/>Of Doris, and the Egean seer, her spouse--<br/>Next, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,<br/>Theban Amphion leaning on his lute:<br/>His fingers went across it--All were mute<br/>To gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,<br/>And Thetis pearly too.--<br/><br/>                           The palace whirls<br/>Around giddy Endymion; seeing he<br/>Was there far strayed from mortality.<br/>He could not bear it--shut his eyes in vain;<br/>Imagination gave a dizzier pain.<br/>"O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!<br/>Where is my lovely mistress? Well-away!<br/>I die--I hear her voice--I feel my wing--"<br/>At Neptune's feet he sank. A sudden ring<br/>Of Nereids were about him, in kind strife<br/>To usher back his spirit into life:<br/>But still he slept. At last they interwove<br/>Their cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey<br/>Towards a crystal bower far away.<br/><br/>  Lo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,<br/>To his inward senses these words spake aloud;<br/>Written in star-light on the dark above:<br/>Dearest Endymion! my entire love!<br/>How have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done--<br/>Immortal bliss for me too hast thou won.<br/>Arise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch<br/>Her ready eggs, before I'll kissing snatch<br/>Thee into endless heaven. Awake! awake!<br/><br/>  The youth at once arose: a placid lake<br/>Came quiet to his eyes; and forest green,<br/>Cooler than all the wonders he had seen,<br/>Lull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast.<br/>How happy once again in grassy nest!
