# üíÆ Upon Appleton House, to My Lord Fairfax by *Andrew Marvell*

<p>
    Within this sober Frame expect<br/>Work of no Forrain Architect;<br/>That unto Caves the Quarries drew,<br/>And Forrests did to Pastures hew;<br/>Who of his great Design in pain<br/>Did for a Model vault his Brain,<br/>Whose Columnes should so high be rais'd<br/>To arch the Brows that on them gaz'd.<br/><br/>Why should of all things Man unrul'd<br/>Such unproportion'd dwellings build?<br/>The Beasts are by their Denns exprest:<br/>And Birds contrive an equal Nest;<br/>The low roof'd Tortoises do dwell<br/>In cases fit of Tortoise-shell:<br/>No Creature loves an empty space;<br/>Their Bodies measure out their Place.<br/><br/>But He, superfluously spread,<br/>Demands more room alive then dead.<br/>And in his hollow Palace goes<br/>Where Winds as he themselves may lose.<br/>What need of all this Marble Crust<br/>T'impark the wanton Mose of Dust,<br/>That thinks by Breadth the World t'unite<br/>Though the first Builders fail'd in Height?<br/><br/>But all things are composed here<br/>Like Nature, orderly and near:<br/>In which we the Dimensions find<br/>Of that more sober Age and Mind,<br/>When larger sized Men did stoop<br/>To enter at a narrow loop;<br/>As practising, in doors so strait,<br/>To strain themselves through Heavens Gate.<br/><br/>And surely when the after Age<br/>Shall hither come in Pilgrimage,<br/>These sacred Places to adore,<br/>By Vere and Fairfax trod before,<br/>Men will dispute how their Extent<br/>Within such dwarfish Confines went:<br/>And some will smile at this, as well<br/>As Romulus his Bee-like Cell.<br/><br/>Humility alone designs<br/>Those short but admirable Lines,<br/>By which, ungirt and unconstrain'd,<br/>Things greater are in less contain'd.<br/>Let others vainly strive t'immure<br/>The Circle in the Quadrature!<br/>These holy Mathematics can<br/>In ev'ry Figure equal Man.<br/><br/>Yet thus the laden House does sweat,<br/>And scarce indures the Master great:<br/>But where he comes the swelling Hall<br/>Stirs, and the Square grows Spherical;<br/>More by his Magnitude distrest,<br/>Then he is by its straitness prest:<br/>And too officiously it slights<br/>That in it self which him delights.<br/><br/>So Honour better Lowness bears,<br/>Then That unwonted Greatness wears<br/>Height with a certain Grace does bend,<br/>But low Things clownishly ascend.<br/>And yet what needs there here Excuse,<br/>Where ev'ry Thing does answer Use?<br/>Where neatness nothing can condemn,<br/>Nor Pride invent what to contemn?<br/><br/>A Stately Frontispice Of Poor<br/>Adorns without the open Door:<br/>Nor less the Rooms within commends<br/>Daily new Furniture Of Friends.<br/>The House was built upon the Place<br/>Only as for a Mark Of Grace;<br/>And for an Inn to entertain<br/>Its Lord a while, but not remain.<br/><br/>Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may,<br/>Or Bilbrough, better hold then they:<br/>But Nature here hath been so free<br/>As if she said leave this to me.<br/>Art would more neatly have defac'd<br/>What she had laid so sweetly wast;<br/>In fragrant Gardens, shaddy Woods,<br/>Deep Meadows, and transparent Floods.<br/><br/>While with slow Eyes we these survey,<br/>And on each pleasant footstep stay,<br/>We opportunly may relate<br/>The progress of this Houses Fate.<br/>A Nunnery first gave it birth.<br/>For Virgin Buildings oft brought forth.<br/>And all that Neighbour-Ruine shows<br/>The Quarries whence this dwelling rose.<br/><br/>Near to this gloomy Cloysters Gates<br/>There dwelt the blooming Virgin Thwates,<br/>Fair beyond Measure, and an Heir<br/>Which might Deformity make fair.<br/>And oft She spent the Summer Suns<br/>Discoursing with the Suttle Nuns.<br/>Whence in these Words one to her weav'd,<br/>(As 'twere by Chance) Thoughts long conceiv'd.<br/><br/>"Within this holy leisure we<br/>"Live innocently as you see.<br/>"these Walls restrain the World without,<br/>"But hedge our Liberty about.<br/>"These Bars inclose the wider Den<br/>"Of those wild Creatures, called Men.<br/>"The Cloyster outward shuts its Gates,<br/>"And, from us, locks on them the Grates.<br/><br/>"Here we, in shining Armour white,<br/>"Like Virgin Amazons do fight.<br/>"And our chast Lamps we hourly trim,<br/>"Lest the great Bridegroom find them dim.<br/>"Our Orient Breaths perfumed are<br/>"With insense of incessant Pray'r.<br/>"And Holy-water of our Tears<br/>"Most strangly our complexion clears.<br/><br/>"Not Tears of Grief; but such as those<br/>"With which calm Pleasure overflows;<br/>"Or Pity, when we look on you<br/>"That live without this happy Vow.<br/>"How should we grieve that must be seen<br/>"Each one a Spouse, and each a Queen;<br/>"And can in Heaven hence behold<br/>"Our brighter Robes and Crowns of Gold?<br/><br/>"When we have prayed all our Beads,<br/>"Some One the holy Legend reads;<br/>"While all the rest with Needles paint<br/>"The Face and Graces of the Saint.<br/>"But what the Linnen can't receive<br/>"They in their Lives do interweave<br/>"This work the Saints best represents;<br/>"That serves for Altar's Ornaments.<br/><br/>"But much it to our work would add<br/>"If here your hand, your Face we had:<br/>"By it we would our Lady touch;<br/>"Yet thus She you resembles much.<br/>"Some of your Features, as we sow'd,<br/>"Through ev'ry Shrine should be bestow'd.<br/>"And in one Beauty we would take<br/>"Enough a thousand Saints to make.<br/><br/>"And (for I dare not quench the Fire<br/>"That me does for your good inspire)<br/>"'Twere Sacriledge a Mant t'admit<br/>"To holy things, for Heaven fit.<br/>"I see the Angels in a Crown<br/>"On you the Lillies show'ring down:<br/>"And round about you Glory breaks,<br/>"That something more then humane speaks.<br/><br/>"All Beauty, when at such a height,<br/>"Is so already consecrate.<br/>"Fairfax I know; and long ere this<br/>"Have mark'd the Youth, and what he is.<br/>"But can he such a Rival seem<br/>"For whom you Heav'n should disesteem?<br/>"Ah, no! and 'twould more Honour prove<br/>"He your Devoto were, then Love.<br/><br/>Here live beloved, and obey'd:<br/>Each one your Sister, each your Maid.<br/>"And, if our Rule seem strictly pend,<br/>"The Rule it self to you shall bend.<br/>"Our Abbess too, now far in Age,<br/>"Doth your succession near presage.<br/>"How soft the yoke on us would lye,<br/>"Might such fair Hands as yours it tye!<br/><br/>"Your voice, the sweetest of the Quire,<br/>"Shall draw Heav'n nearer, raise us higher.<br/>"And your Example, if our Head,<br/>"Will soon us to perfection lead.<br/>"Those Virtues to us all so dear,<br/>"Will straight grow Sanctity when here:<br/>"And that, once sprung, increase so fast<br/>"Till Miracles it work at last.<br/><br/>"Nor is our Order yet so nice,<br/>"Delight to banish as a Vice.<br/>"Here Pleasure Piety doth meet;<br/>"One perfecting the other Sweet.<br/>"So through the mortal fruit we boyl<br/>"The Sugars uncorrupting Oyl:<br/>"And that which perisht while we pull,<br/>"Is thus preserved clear and full.<br/><br/>"For such indeed are all our Arts;<br/>"Still handling Natures finest Parts.<br/>"Flow'rs dress the Altars; for the Clothes,<br/>"The Sea-born Amber we compose;<br/>"Balms for the griv'd we draw; and pasts<br/>"We mold, as Baits for curious tasts.<br/>"What need is here of Man? unless<br/>"These as sweet Sins we should confess.<br/><br/>"Each Night among us to your side<br/>"Appoint a fresh and Virgin Bride;<br/>"Whom if Our Lord at midnight find,<br/>"Yet Neither should be left behind.<br/>"Where you may lye as chast in Bed,<br/>"As Pearls together billeted.<br/>"All Night embracing Arm in Arm,<br/>"Like Chrystal pure with Cotton warm.<br/><br/>"But what is this to all the store<br/>"Of Joys you see, and may make more!<br/>"Try but a while, if you be wise:<br/>"The Tryal neither Costs, nor Tyes.<br/>Now Fairfax seek her promis'd faith:<br/>Religion that dispensed hath;<br/>Which She hence forward does begin;<br/>The Nuns smooth Tongue has suckt her in.<br/><br/>Oft, though he knew it was in vain,<br/>Yet would he valiantly complain.<br/>"Is this that Sanctity so great,<br/>"An Art by which you finly'r cheat<br/>"Hypocrite Witches, hence Avant,<br/>"Who though in prison yet inchant!<br/>"Death only can such Theeves make fast,<br/>"As rob though in the Dungeon cast.<br/><br/>"Were there but, when this House was made,<br/>"One Stone that a just Hand had laid,<br/>"It must have fall'n upon her Head<br/>"Who first Thee from thy Faith misled.<br/>"And yet, how well soever ment,<br/>"With them 'twould soon grow fraudulent<br/>"For like themselves they alter all,<br/>"And vice infects the very Wall.<br/><br/>"But sure those Buildings last not long,<br/>"Founded by Folly, kept by Wrong.<br/>"I know what Fruit their Gardens yield,<br/>"When they it think by Night conceal'd.<br/>"Fly from their Vices. 'Tis thy state,<br/>"Not Thee, that they would consecrate.<br/>"Fly from their Ruine. How I fear<br/>"Though guiltless lest thou perish there.<br/><br/>What should he do? He would respect<br/>Religion, but not Right neglect:<br/>For first Religion taught him Right,<br/>And dazled not but clear'd his sight.<br/>Sometimes resolv'd his Sword he draws,<br/>But reverenceth then the Laws:<br/>"For Justice still that Courage led;<br/>First from a Judge, then Souldier bred.<br/><br/>Small Honour would be in the Storm.<br/>The Court him grants the lawful Form;<br/>Which licens'd either Peace or Force,<br/>To hinder the unjust Divorce.<br/>Yet still the Nuns his Right debar'd,<br/>Standing upon their holy Guard.<br/>Ill-counsell'd Women, do you know<br/>Whom you resist, or what you do?<br/><br/>Is not this he whose Offspring fierce<br/>Shall fight through all the Universe;<br/>And with successive Valour try<br/>France, Poland, either Germany;<br/>Till one, as long since prophecy'd,<br/>His Horse through conquer'd Britain ride?<br/>Yet, against Fate, his Spouse they kept;<br/>And the great Race would intercept.<br/><br/>Some to the Breach against their Foes<br/>Their Wooden Saints in vain oppose<br/>Another bolder stands at push<br/>With their old Holy-Water Brush.<br/>While the disjointed Abbess threads<br/>The gingling Chain-shot of her Beads.<br/>But their lowd'st Cannon were their Lungs;<br/>And sharpest Weapons were their Tongues.<br/><br/>But, waving these aside like Flyes,<br/>Young Fairfax through the Wall does rise.<br/>Then th' unfrequented Vault appear'd,<br/>And superstitions vainly fear'd.<br/>The Relicks False were set to view;<br/>Only the Jewels there were true.<br/>But truly bright and holy Thwaites<br/>That weeping at the Altar waites.<br/><br/>But the glad Youth away her bears,<br/>And to the Nuns bequeaths her Tears:<br/>Who guiltily their Prize bemoan,<br/>Like Gipsies that a Child hath stoln.<br/>Thenceforth (as when th' Inchantment ends<br/>The Castle vanishes or rends)<br/>The wasting Cloister with the rest<br/>Was in one instant dispossest.<br/><br/>At the demolishing, this Seat<br/>To Fairfax fell as by Escheat.<br/>And what both Nuns and Founders will'd<br/>'Tis likely better thus fulfill'd,<br/>For if the Virgin prov'd not theirs,<br/>The Cloyster yet remained hers.<br/>Though many a Nun there made her vow,<br/>'Twas no Religious-House till now.<br/><br/>From that blest Bed the Heroe came,<br/>Whom France and Poland yet does fame:<br/>Who, when retired here to Peace,<br/>His warlike Studies could not cease;<br/>But laid these Gardens out in sport<br/>In the just Figure of a Fort;<br/>And with five Bastions it did fence,<br/>As aiming one for ev'ry Sense.<br/><br/>When in the East the Morning Ray<br/>Hangs out the Colours of the Day,<br/>The Bee through these known Allies hums,<br/>Beating the Dian with its Drumms.<br/>Then Flow'rs their drowsie Eylids raise,<br/>Their Silken Ensigns each displayes,<br/>And dries its Pan yet dank with Dew,<br/>And fills its Flask with Odours new.<br/><br/>These, as their Governour goes by,<br/>In fragrant Vollyes they let fly;<br/>And to salute their Governess<br/>Again as great a charge they press:<br/>None for the Virgin Nymph; for She<br/>Seems with the Flow'rs a Flow'r to be.<br/>And think so still! though not compare<br/>With Breath so sweet, or Cheek so faire.<br/><br/>Well shot ye Fireman! Oh how sweet,<br/>And round your equal Fires do meet;<br/>Whose shrill report no Ear can tell,<br/>But Ecchoes to the Eye and smell.<br/>See how the Flow'rs, as at Parade,<br/>Under their Colours stand displaid:<br/>Each Regiment in order grows,<br/>That of the Tulip Pinke and Rose.<br/><br/>But when the vigilant Patroul<br/>Of Stars walks round about the Pole,<br/>Their Leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd,<br/>Seem to their Staves the Ensigns furl'd.<br/>Then in some Flow'rs beloved Hut<br/>Each Bee as Sentinel is shut;<br/>And sleeps so too: but, if once stir'd,<br/>She runs you through, or askes The Word.<br/><br/>Oh Thou, that dear and happy Isle<br/>The Garden of the World ere while,<br/>Thou Paradise of four Seas,<br/>Which Heaven planted us to please,<br/>But, to exclude the World, did guard<br/>With watry if not flaming Sword;<br/>What luckless Apple did we tast,<br/>To make us Mortal, and The Wast.<br/><br/>Unhappy! shall we never more<br/>That sweet Milltia restore,<br/>When Gardens only had their Towrs,<br/>And all the Garrisons were Flow'rs,<br/>When Roses only Arms might bear,<br/>And Men did rosie Garlands wear?<br/>Tulips, in several Colours barr'd,<br/>Were then the Switzers of our Guard.<br/><br/>The Gardiner had the Souldiers place,<br/>And his more gentle Forts did trace.<br/>The Nursery of all things green<br/>Was then the only Magazeen.<br/>The Winter Quarters were the Stoves,<br/>Where he the tender Plants removes.<br/>But War all this doth overgrow:<br/>We Ord'nance Plant and Powder sow.<br/><br/>And yet their walks one on the Sod<br/>Who, had it pleased him and God,<br/>Might once have made our Gardens spring<br/>Fresh as his own and flourishing.<br/>But he preferr'd to the Cinque Ports<br/>These five imaginary Forts:<br/>And, in those half-dry Trenches, spann'd<br/>Pow'r which the Ocean might command.<br/><br/>For he did, with his utmost Skill,<br/>Ambition weed, but Conscience till.<br/>Conscience, that Heaven-nursed Plant,<br/>Which most our Earthly Gardens want.<br/>A prickling leaf it bears, and such<br/>As that which shrinks at ev'ry touch;<br/>But Flow'rs eternal, and divine,<br/>That in the Crowns of Saints do shine.<br/><br/>The sight does from these Bastions ply,<br/>Th' invisible Artilery;<br/>And at proud Cawood Castle seems<br/>To point the Battery of its Beams.<br/>As if it quarrell'd in the Seat<br/>Th' Ambition of its Prelate great.<br/>But ore the Meads below it plays,<br/>Or innocently seems to gaze.<br/><br/>And now to the Abbyss I pass<br/>Of that unfathomable Grass,<br/>Where Men like Grashoppers appear,<br/>But Grashoppers are Gyants there:<br/>They, in there squeking Laugh, contemn<br/>Us as we walk more low then them:<br/>And, from the Precipices tall<br/>Of the green spir's, to us do call.<br/><br/>To see Men through this Meadow Dive,<br/>We wonder how they rise alive.<br/>As, under Water, none does know<br/>Whether he fall through it or go.<br/>But, as the Marriners that sound,<br/>And show upon their Lead the Ground,<br/>They bring up Flow'rs so to be seen,<br/>And prove they've at the Bottom been.<br/><br/>No Scene that turns with Engines strange<br/>Does oftner then these Meadows change,<br/>For when the Sun the Grass hath vext,<br/>The tawny Mowers enter next;<br/>Who seem like Israaliies to be,<br/>Walking on foot through a green Sea.<br/>To them the Grassy Deeps divide,<br/>And crowd a Lane to either Side.<br/><br/>With whistling Sithe, and Elbow strong,<br/>These Massacre the Grass along:<br/>While one, unknowing, carves the Rail,<br/>Whose yet unfeather'd Quils her fail.<br/>The Edge all bloody from its Breast<br/>He draws, and does his stroke detest;<br/>Fearing the Flesh untimely mow'd<br/>To him a Fate as black forebode.<br/><br/>But bloody Thestylis, that waites<br/>To bring the mowing Camp their Cates,<br/>Greedy as Kites has trust it up,<br/>And forthwith means on it to sup:<br/>When on another quick She lights,<br/>And cryes, he call'd us Israelites;<br/>But now, to make his saying true,<br/>Rails rain for Quails, for Manna Dew.<br/><br/>Unhappy Birds! what does it boot<br/>To build below the Grasses Root;<br/>When Lowness is unsafe as Hight,<br/>And Chance o'retakes what scapeth spight?<br/>And now your Orphan Parents Call<br/>Sounds your untimely Funeral.<br/>Death-Trumpets creak in such a Note,<br/>And 'tis the Sourdine in their Throat.<br/><br/>Or sooner hatch or higher build:<br/>The Mower now commands the Field;<br/>In whose new Traverse seemeth wrought<br/>A Camp of Battail newly fought:<br/>Where, as the Meads with Hay, the Plain<br/>Lyes quilted ore with Bodies slain:<br/>The Women that with forks it filing,<br/>Do represent the Pillaging.<br/><br/>And now the careless Victors play,<br/>Dancing the Triumphs of the Hay;<br/>Where every Mowers wholesome Heat<br/>Smells like an Alexanders Sweat.<br/>Their Females fragrant as the Mead<br/>Which they in Fairy Circles tread:<br/>When at their Dances End they kiss,<br/>Their new-made Hay not sweeter is.<br/><br/>When after this 'tis pil'd in Cocks,<br/>Like a calm Sea it shews the Rocks:<br/>We wondring in the River near<br/>How Boats among them safely steer.<br/>Or, like the Desert Memphis Sand,<br/>Short Pyramids of Hay do stand.<br/>And such the Roman Camps do rise<br/>In Hills for Soldiers Obsequies.<br/><br/>This Scene again withdrawing brings<br/>A new and empty Face of things;<br/>A levell'd space, as smooth and plain,<br/>As Clothes for Lilly strecht to stain.<br/>The World when first created sure<br/>Was such a Table rase and pure.<br/>Or rather such is the Toril<br/>Ere the Bulls enter at Madril.<br/><br/>For to this naked equal Flat,<br/>Which Levellers take Pattern at,<br/>The Villagers in common chase<br/>Their Cattle, which it closer rase;<br/>And what below the Sith increast<br/>Is pincht yet nearer by the Breast.<br/>Such, in the painted World, appear'd<br/>Davenant with th'Universal Heard.<br/><br/>They seem within the polisht Grass<br/>A landskip drawen in Looking-Glass.<br/>And shrunk in the huge Pasture show<br/>As spots, so shap'd, on Faces do.<br/>Such Fleas, ere they approach the Eye,<br/>In Multiplyiug Glasses lye.<br/>They feed so wide, so slowly move,<br/>As Constellatious do above.<br/><br/>Then, to conclude these pleasant Acts,<br/>Denton sets ope its Cataracts;<br/>And makes the Meadow truly be<br/>(What it but seem'd before) a Sea.<br/>For, jealous of its Lords long stay,<br/>It try's t'invite him thus away.<br/>The River in it self is drown'd,<br/>And Isl's th' astonish Cattle round.<br/><br/>Let others tell the Paradox,<br/>How Eels now bellow in the Ox;<br/>How Horses at their Tails do kick,<br/>Turn'd as they hang to Leeches quick;<br/>How Boats can over Bridges sail;<br/>And Fishes do the Stables scale.<br/>How Salmons trespassing are found;<br/>And Pikes are taken in the Pound.<br/><br/>But I, retiring from the Flood,<br/>Take Sanctuary in the Wood;<br/>And, while it lasts, my self imbark<br/>In this yet green, yet growing Ark;<br/>Where the first Carpenter might best<br/>Fit Timber for his Keel have Prest.<br/>And where all Creatures might have shares,<br/>Although in Armies, not in Paires.<br/><br/>The double Wood of ancient Stocks<br/>Link'd in so thick, an Union locks,<br/>It like two Pedigrees appears,<br/>On one hand Fairfax, th' other Veres:<br/>Of whom though many fell in War,<br/>Yet more to Heaven shooting are:<br/>And, as they Natures Cradle deckt,<br/>Will in green Age her Hearse expect.<br/><br/>When first the Eye this Forrest sees<br/>It seems indeed as Wood not Trees:<br/>As if their Neighbourhood so old<br/>To one great Trunk them all did mold.<br/>There the huge Bulk takes place, as ment<br/>To thrust up a Fifth Element;<br/>And stretches still so closely wedg'd<br/>As if the Night within were hedg'd.<br/><br/>Dark all without it knits; within<br/>It opens passable and thin;<br/>And in as loose an order grows,<br/>As the Corinthean Porticoes.<br/>The Arching Boughs unite between<br/>The Columnes of the Temple green;<br/>And underneath the winged Quires<br/>Echo about their tuned Fires.<br/><br/>The Nightingale does here make choice<br/>To sing the Tryals of her Voice.<br/>Low Shrubs she sits in, and adorns<br/>With Musick high the squatted Thorns.<br/>But highest Oakes stoop down to hear,<br/>And listning Elders prick the Ear.<br/>The Thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws<br/>Within the Skin its shrunken claws.<br/><br/>But I have for my Musick found<br/>A Sadder, yet more pleasing Sound:<br/>The Stock-doves whose fair necks are grac'd<br/>With Nuptial Rings their Ensigns chast;<br/>Yet always, for some Cause unknown,<br/>Sad pair unto the Elms they moan.<br/>O why should such a Couple mourn,<br/>That in so equal Flames do burn!<br/><br/>Then as I carless on the Bed<br/>Of gelid Straw-berryes do tread,<br/>And through the Hazles thick espy<br/>The hatching Thrastles shining Eye,<br/>The Heron from the Ashes top,<br/>The eldest of its young lets drop,<br/>As if it Stork-like did pretend<br/>That Tribute to its Lord to send.<br/><br/>But most the Hewel's wonders are,<br/>Who here has the Holt-felsters care.<br/>He walks still upright from the Root,<br/>Meas'ring the Timber with his Foot;<br/>And all the way, to keep it clean,<br/>Doth from the Bark the Wood-moths glean.<br/>He, with his Beak, examines well<br/>Which fit to stand and which to fell.<br/><br/>The good he numbers up, and hacks;<br/>As if he mark'd them with the Ax.<br/>But where he, tinkling with his Beak,<br/>Does find the hollow Oak to speak,<br/>That for his building he designs,<br/>And through the tainted Side he mines.<br/>Who could have thought the tallest Oak<br/>Should fall by such a feeble Strok'!<br/><br/>Nor would it, had the Tree not fed<br/>A Traitor-worm, within it bred.<br/>(As first our Flesh corrupt within<br/>Tempts impotent and bashful Sin.<br/>And yet that Worm triumphs not long,<br/>But serves to feed the Hewels young.<br/>While the Oake seems to fall content,<br/>Viewing the Treason's Punishment.<br/><br/>Thus I, easie Philosopher,<br/>Among the Birds and Trees confer:<br/>And little now to make me, wants<br/>Or of the Fowles, or of the Plants.<br/>Give me but Wings as they, and I<br/>Streight floting on the Air shall fly:<br/>Or turn me but, and you shall see<br/>I was but an inverted Tree.<br/><br/>Already I begin to call<br/>In their most-learned Original:<br/>And where I Language want,my Signs<br/>The Bird upon the Bough divines;<br/>And more attentive there doth sit<br/>Then if She were with Lime-twigs knit.<br/>No Leaf does tremble in the Wind<br/>Which I returning cannot find.<br/><br/>Out of these scatter'd Sibyls Leaves<br/>Strange Prophecies my Phancy weaves:<br/>And in one History consumes,<br/>Like Mexique Paintings, all the Plumes.<br/>What Rome, Greece, Palestine, ere said<br/>I in this light Mosaick read.<br/>Thrice happy he who, not mistook,<br/>Hath read in Natures mystick Book.<br/><br/>And see how Chance's better Wit<br/>Could with a Mask my studies hit!<br/>The Oak-Leaves me embroyder all,<br/>Between which Caterpillars crawl:<br/>And Ivy, with familiar trails,<br/>Me licks, and clasps, and curles, and hales.<br/>Under this antick Cope I move<br/>Like some great Prelate of the Grove,<br/><br/>Then, languishing with ease, I toss<br/>On Pallets swoln of Velvet Moss;<br/>While the Wind, cooling through the Boughs,<br/>Flatters with Air my panting Brows.<br/>Thanks for my Rest ye Mossy Banks,<br/>And unto you cool Zephyr's Thanks,<br/>Who, as my Hair, my Thoughts too shed,<br/>And winnow from the Chaff my Head.<br/><br/>How safe, methinks, and strong, behind<br/>These Trees have I incamp'd my Mind;<br/>Where Beauty, aiming at the Heart,<br/>Bends in some Tree its useless Dart;<br/>And where the World no certain Shot<br/>Can make, or me it toucheth not.<br/>But I on it securely play,<br/>And gaul its Horsemen all the Day.<br/><br/>Bind me ye Woodbines in your 'twines,<br/>Curle me about ye gadding Vines,<br/>And Oh so close your Circles lace,<br/>That I may never leave this Place:<br/>But, lest your Fetters prove too weak,<br/>Ere I your Silken Bondage break,<br/>Do you, O Brambles, chain me too,<br/>And courteous Briars nail me though.<br/><br/>Here in the Morning tye my Chain,<br/>Where the two Woods have made a Lane;<br/>While, like a Guard on either side,<br/>The Trees before their Lord divide;<br/>This, like a long and equal Thread,<br/>Betwixt two Labyrinths does lead.<br/>But, where the Floods did lately drown,<br/>There at the Ev'ning stake me down.<br/><br/>For now the Waves are fal'n and dry'd,<br/>And now the Meadows fresher dy'd;<br/>Whose Grass, with moister colour dasht,<br/>Seems as green Silks but newly washt.<br/>No Serpent new nor Crocodile<br/>Remains behind our little Nile;<br/>Unless it self you will mistake,<br/>Among these Meads the only Snake.<br/><br/>See in what wanton harmless folds<br/>It ev'ry where the Meadow holds;<br/>And its yet muddy back doth lick,<br/>Till as a Chrystal Mirrour slick;<br/>Where all things gaze themselves, and doubt<br/>If they be in it or without.<br/>And for his shade which therein shines,<br/>Narcissus like, the Sun too pines.<br/><br/>Oh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge<br/>My Temples here with heavy sedge;<br/>Abandoning my lazy Side,<br/>Stretcht as a Bank unto the Tide;<br/>Or to suspend my sliding Foot<br/>On the Osiers undermined Root,<br/>And in its Branches tough to hang,<br/>While at my Lines the Fishes twang!<br/><br/>But now away my Hooks, my Quills,<br/>And Angles, idle Utensils.<br/>The Young Maria walks to night:<br/>Hide trifling Youth thy Pleasures slight.<br/>'Twere shame that such judicious Eyes<br/>Should with such Toyes a Man surprize;<br/>She that already is the Law<br/>Of all her Sex, her Ages Aw.<br/><br/>See how loose Nature, in respect<br/>To her, it self doth recollect;<br/>And every thing so whisht and fine,<br/>Starts forth with to its Bonne Mine.<br/>The Sun himself, of Her aware,<br/>Seems to descend with greater Care,<br/>And lest She see him go to Bed,<br/>In blushing Clouds conceales his Head.<br/><br/>So when the Shadows laid asleep<br/>From underneath these Banks do creep,<br/>And on the River as it flows<br/>With Eben Shuts begin to close;<br/>The modest Halcyon comes in sight,<br/>Flying betwixt the Day and Night;<br/>And such an horror calm and dumb,<br/>Admiring Nature does benum.<br/><br/>The viscous Air, wheres'ere She fly,<br/>Follows and sucks her Azure dy;<br/>The gellying Stream compacts below,<br/>If it might fix her shadow so;<br/>The Stupid Fishes hang, as plain<br/>As Flies in Chrystal overt'ane,<br/>And Men the silent Scene assist,<br/>Charm'd with the saphir-winged Mist.<br/><br/>Maria such, and so doth hush<br/>The World, and through the Ev'ning rush.<br/>No new-born Comet such a Train<br/>Draws through the Skie, nor Star new-slain.<br/>For streight those giddy Rockets fail,<br/>Which from the putrid Earth exhale,<br/>But by her Flames, in Heaven try'd,<br/>Nature is wholly Vitrifi'd.<br/><br/>'Tis She that to these Gardens gave<br/>That wondrous Beauty which they have;<br/>She streightness on the Woods bestows;<br/>To Her the Meadow sweetness owes;<br/>Nothing could make the River be<br/>So Chrystal-pure but only She;<br/>She yet more Pure, Sweet, Streight, and Fair,<br/>Then Gardens, Woods, Meads, Rivers are.<br/><br/>Therefore what first She on them spent,<br/>They gratefully again present.<br/>The Meadow Carpets where to tread;<br/>The Garden Flow'rs to Crown Her Head;<br/>And for a Glass the limpid Brook,<br/>Where She may all her Beautyes look;<br/>But, since She would not have them seen,<br/>The Wood about her draws a Skreen.<br/><br/>For She, to higher Beauties rais'd,<br/>Disdains to be for lesser prais'd.<br/>She counts her Beauty to converse<br/>In all the Languages as hers;<br/>Not yet in those her self imployes<br/>But for the Wisdome, not the Noyse;<br/>Nor yet that Wisdome would affect,<br/>But as 'tis Heavens Dialect.<br/><br/>Blest Nymph! that couldst so soon prevent<br/>Those Trains by Youth against thee meant;<br/>Tears (watry Shot that pierce the Mind;)<br/>And Sighs (Loves Cannon charg'd with Wind;)<br/>True Praise (That breaks through all defence;)<br/>And feign'd complying Innocence;<br/>But knowing where this Ambush lay,<br/>She scap'd the safe, but roughest Way.<br/><br/>This 'tis to have been from the first<br/>In a Domestick Heaven nurst,<br/>Under the Discipline severe<br/>Of Fairfax, and the starry Vere;<br/>Where not one object can come nigh<br/>But pure, and spotless as the Eye;<br/>And Goodness doth it self intail<br/>On Females, if there want a Male.<br/><br/>Go now fond Sex that on your Face<br/>Do all your useless Study place,<br/>Nor once at Vice your Brows dare knit<br/>Lest the smooth Forehead wrinkled sit<br/>Yet your own Face shall at you grin,<br/>Thorough the Black-bag of your Skin;<br/>When knowledge only could have fill'd<br/>And Virtue all those Furows till'd.<br/><br/>Hence She with Graces more divine<br/>Supplies beyond her Sex the Line;<br/>And, like a sprig of Misleto,<br/>On the Fairfacian Oak does grow;<br/>Whence, for some universal good,<br/>The Priest shall cut the sacred Bud;<br/>While her glad Parents most rejoice,<br/>And make their Destiny their Choice.<br/><br/>Mean time ye Fields, Springs, Bushes, Flow'rs,<br/>Where yet She leads her studious Hours,<br/>(Till Fate her worthily translates,<br/>And find a Fairfax for our Thwaites)<br/>Employ the means you have by Her,<br/>And in your kind your selves preferr;<br/>That, as all Virgins She preceds,<br/>So you all Woods, Streams, Gardens, Meads.<br/><br/>For you Thessalian Tempe's Seat<br/>Shall now be scorn'd as obsolete;<br/>Aranjeuz, as less, disdain'd;<br/>The Bel-Retiro as constrain'd;<br/>But name not the Idalian Grove,<br/>For 'twas the Seat of wanton Love;<br/>Much less the Dead's Elysian Fields,<br/>Yet nor to them your Beauty yields.<br/><br/>'Tis not, what once it was, the World;<br/>But a rude heap together hurl'd;<br/>All negligently overthrown,<br/>Gulfes, Deserts, Precipices, Stone.<br/>Your lesser World contains the same.<br/>But in more decent Order tame;<br/>You Heaven's Center, Nature's Lap.<br/>And Paradice's only Map.<br/><br/>But now the Salmon-Fishers moist<br/>Their Leathern Boats begin to hoist;<br/>And, like Antipodes in Shoes,<br/>Have shod their Heads in their Canoos.<br/>How Tortoise like, but not so slow,<br/>These rational Amphibii go?<br/>Let's in: for the dark Hemisphere<br/>Does now like one of them appear.
