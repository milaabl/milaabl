# üíÆ The Hard Times In Elfland by *Sidney Lanier*

<p>
    A Story of Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>Strange that the termagant winds should scold<br/>The Christmas Eve so bitterly!<br/>But Wife, and Harry the four-year-old,<br/>Big Charley, Nimblewits, and I,<br/><br/>Blithe as the wind was bitter, drew<br/>More frontward of the mighty fire,<br/>Where wise Newfoundland Fan foreknew<br/>The heaven that Christian dogs desire --<br/><br/>Stretched o'er the rug, serene and grave,<br/>Huge nose on heavy paws reclined,<br/>With never a drowning boy to save,<br/>And warmth of body and peace of mind.<br/><br/>And, as our happy circle sat,<br/>The fire well capp'd the company:<br/>In grave debate or careless chat,<br/>A right good fellow, mingled he:<br/><br/>He seemed as one of us to sit,<br/>And talked of things above, below,<br/>With flames more winsome than our wit,<br/>And coals that burned like love aglow.<br/><br/>While thus our rippling discourse rolled<br/>Smooth down the channel of the night,<br/>We spoke of Time: thereat, one told<br/>A parable of the Seasons' flight.<br/><br/>"Time was a Shepherd with four sheep.<br/>In a certain Field he long abode.<br/>He stood by the bars, and his flock bade leap<br/>One at a time to the Common Road.<br/><br/>"And first there leapt, like bird on wing,<br/>A lissome Lamb that played in the air.<br/>I heard the Shepherd call him `Spring':<br/>Oh, large-eyed, fresh and snowy fair<br/><br/>"He skipped the flowering Highway fast,<br/>Hurried the hedgerows green and white,<br/>Set maids and men a-yearning, passed<br/>The Bend, and gamboll'd out of sight.<br/><br/>"And next marched forth a matron Ewe<br/>(While Time took down a bar for her),<br/>Udder'd so large 'twas much ado<br/>E'en then to clear the barrier.<br/><br/>"Full softly shone her silken fleece<br/>What stately time she paced along:<br/>Each heartsome hoof-stroke wrought increase<br/>Of sunlight, substance, seedling, song,<br/><br/>"In flower, in fruit, in field, in bird,<br/>Till the great globe, rich fleck'd and pied,<br/>Like some large peach half pinkly furred,<br/>Turned to the sun a glowing side<br/><br/>"And hung in the heavenly orchard, bright,<br/>None-such, complete.<br/>Then, while the Ewe<br/>Slow passed the Bend, a blur of light,<br/>The Shepherd's face in sadness grew:<br/><br/>"`Summer!' he said, as one would say<br/>A sigh in syllables. So, in haste<br/>(For shame of Summer's long delay,<br/>Yet gazing still what way she paced),<br/><br/>"He summoned Autumn, slanting down<br/>The second bar. Thereover strode<br/>A Wether, fleeced in burning brown,<br/>And largely loitered down the Road.<br/><br/>"Far as the farmers sight his shape<br/>Majestic moving o'er the way,<br/>All cry `To harvest,' crush the grape,<br/>And haul the corn and house the hay,<br/><br/>"Till presently, no man can say,<br/>(So brown the woods that line that end)<br/>If yet the brown-fleeced Wether may,<br/>Or not, have passed beyond the Bend.<br/><br/>"Now turn I towards the Shepherd: lo,<br/>An aged Ram, flapp'd, gnarly-horn'd,<br/>With bones that crackle o'er the snow,<br/>Rheum'd, wind-gall'd, rag-fleec'd, burr'd and thorn'd.<br/><br/>"Time takes the third bar off for him,<br/>He totters down the windy lane.<br/>'Tis Winter, still: the Bend lies dim.<br/>O Lamb, would thou wouldst leap again!"<br/><br/>Those seasons out, we talked of these:<br/>And I (with inward purpose sly<br/>To shield my purse from Christmas trees<br/>And stockings and wild robbery<br/><br/>When Hal and Nimblewits invade<br/>My cash in Santa Claus's name)<br/>In full the hard, hard times surveyed;<br/>Denounced all waste as crime and shame;<br/><br/>Hinted that "waste" might be a term<br/>Including skates, velocipedes,<br/>Kites, marbles, soldiers, towers infirm,<br/>Bows, arrows, cannon, Indian reeds,<br/><br/>Cap-pistols, drums, mechanic toys,<br/>And all th' infernal host of horns<br/>Whereby to strenuous hells of noise<br/>Are turned the blessed Christmas morns;<br/><br/>Thus, roused -- those horns! -- to sacred rage,<br/>I rose, forefinger high in air,<br/>When Harry cried (SOME war to wage),<br/>"Papa, is hard times ev'ywhere?<br/><br/>"Maybe in Santa Claus's land<br/>It isn't hard times none at all!"<br/>Now, blessed Vision! to my hand<br/>Most pat, a marvel strange did fall.<br/><br/>Scarce had my Harry ceased, when "Look!"<br/>He cried, leapt up in wild alarm,<br/>Ran to my Comrade, shelter took<br/>Beneath the startled mother's arm.<br/><br/>And so was still: what time we saw<br/>A foot hang down the fireplace! Then,<br/>With painful scrambling scratched and raw,<br/>Two hands that seemed like hands of men<br/><br/>Eased down two legs and a body through<br/>The blazing fire, and forth there came<br/>Before our wide and wondering view<br/>A figure shrinking half with shame,<br/><br/>And half with weakness. "Sir," I said,<br/>-- But with a mien of dignity<br/>The seedy stranger raised his head:<br/>"My friends, I'm Santa Claus," said he.<br/><br/>But oh, how changed! That rotund face<br/>The new moon rivall'd, pale and thin;<br/>Where once was cheek, now empty space;<br/>Whate'er stood out, did now stand in.<br/><br/>His piteous legs scarce propped him up:<br/>His arms mere sickles seemed to be:<br/>But most o'erflowed our sorrow's cup<br/>When that we saw -- or did not see --<br/><br/>His belly: we remembered how<br/>It shook like a bowl of jelly fine:<br/>An earthquake could not shake it now;<br/>He HAD no belly -- not a sign.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes, old friends, you well may stare:<br/>I HAVE seen better days," he said:<br/>"But now, with shrinkage, loss and care,<br/>Your Santa Claus scarce owns his head.<br/><br/>"We've had such hard, hard times this year<br/>For goblins! Never knew the like.<br/>All Elfland's mortgaged! And we fear<br/>The gnomes are just about to strike.<br/><br/>"I once was rich, and round, and hale.<br/>The whole world called me jolly brick;<br/>But listen to a piteous tale.<br/>Young Harry, -- Santa Claus is sick!<br/><br/>"'Twas thus: a smooth-tongued railroad man<br/>Comes to my house and talks to me:<br/>`I've got,' says he, `a little plan<br/>That suits this nineteenth century.<br/><br/>"`Instead of driving, as you do,<br/>Six reindeer slow from house to house,<br/>Let's build a Grand Trunk Railway through<br/>From here to earth's last terminus.<br/><br/>"`We'll touch at every chimney-top<br/>(An Elevated Track, of course),<br/>Then, as we whisk you by, you'll drop<br/>Each package down: just think, the force<br/><br/>"`You'll save, the time! -- Besides, we'll make<br/>Our millions: look you, soon we will<br/>Compete for freights -- and then we'll take<br/>Dame Fortune's bales of good and ill<br/><br/>"`(Why, she's the biggest shipper, sir,<br/>That e'er did business in this world!):<br/>Then Death, that ceaseless Traveller,<br/>Shall on his rounds by us be whirled.<br/><br/>"`When ghosts return to walk with men,<br/>We'll bring 'em cheap by steam, and fast:<br/>We'll run a Branch to heaven! and then<br/>We'll riot, man; for then, at last<br/><br/>"`We'll make with heaven a contract fair<br/>To call, each hour, from town to town,<br/>And carry the dead folks' souls up there,<br/>And bring the unborn babies down!'<br/><br/>"The plan seemed fair: I gave him cash,<br/>Nay, every penny I could raise.<br/>My wife e'er cried, `'Tis rash, 'tis rash:'<br/>How could I know the stock-thief's ways?<br/><br/>"But soon I learned full well, poor fool!<br/>My woes began, that wretched day.<br/>The President plied me like a tool.<br/>In lawyer's fees, and rights of way,<br/><br/>"Injunctions, leases, charters, I<br/>Was meshed as in a mighty maze.<br/>The stock ran low, the talk ran high:<br/>Then quickly flamed the final blaze.<br/><br/>"With never an inch of track -- 'tis true!<br/>The debts were large . . . the oft-told tale.<br/>The President rolled in splendor new<br/>-- He bought my silver at the sale.<br/><br/>"Yes, sold me out: we've moved away.<br/>I've had to give up everything.<br/>My reindeer, even, whom I . . . pray,<br/>Excuse me" . . . here, o'er-sorrowing,<br/><br/>Poor Santa Claus burst into tears,<br/>Then calmed again: "my reindeer fleet,<br/>I gave them up: on foot, my dears,<br/>I now must plod through snow and sleet.<br/><br/>"Retrenchment rules in Elfland, now;<br/>Yes, every luxury is cut off.<br/>-- Which, by the way, reminds me how<br/>I caught this dreadful hacking cough:<br/><br/>"I cut off the tail of my Ulster furred<br/>To make young Kris a coat of state.<br/>That very night the storm occurred!<br/>Thus we became the sport of Fate.<br/><br/>"For I was out till after one,<br/>Surveying chimney-tops and roofs,<br/>And planning how it could be done<br/>Without my reindeers' bouncing hoofs.<br/><br/>"`My dear,' says Mrs. Claus, that night<br/>(A most superior woman she!)<br/>`It never, never can be right<br/>That you, deep-sunk in poverty,<br/><br/>"`This year should leave your poor old bed,<br/>And trot about, bent down with toys,<br/>(There's Kris a-crying now for bread!)<br/>To give to other people's boys.<br/><br/>"`Since you've been out, the news arrives<br/>The Elfs' Insurance Company's gone.<br/>Ah, Claus, those premiums! Now, our lives<br/>Depend on yours: thus griefs go on.<br/><br/>"`And even while you're thus harassed,<br/>I do believe, if out you went,<br/>You'd go, in spite of all that's passed,<br/>To the children of that President!'<br/><br/>"Oh, Charley, Harry, Nimblewits,<br/>These eyes, that night, ne'er slept a wink.<br/>My path seemed honeycombed with pits.<br/>Naught could I do but think and think.<br/><br/>"But, with the day, my courage rose.<br/>Ne'er shall my boys, MY boys (I cried),<br/>When Christmas morns their eyes unclose,<br/>Find empty stockings gaping wide!<br/><br/>"Then hewed and whacked and whittled I;<br/>The wife, the girls and Kris took fire;<br/>They spun, sewed, cut, -- till by and by<br/>We made, at home, my pack entire!"<br/><br/>(He handed me a bundle, here.)<br/>"Now, hoist me up: there, gently: quick!<br/>Dear boys, DON'T look for much this year:<br/>Remember, Santa Claus is sick!"
