# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Knight's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    WHILOM, as olde stories tellen us,<br/>There was a duke that highte Theseus.<br/>Of Athens he was lord and governor,<br/>And in his time such a conqueror<br/>That greater was there none under the sun.<br/>Full many a riche country had he won.<br/>What with his wisdom and his chivalry,<br/>He conquer'd all the regne of Feminie,<br/>That whilom was y-cleped Scythia;<br/>And weddede the Queen Hippolyta<br/>And brought her home with him to his country<br/>With muchel glory and great solemnity,<br/>And eke her younge sister Emily,<br/>And thus with vict'ry and with melody<br/>Let I this worthy Duke to Athens ride,<br/>And all his host, in armes him beside.<br/><br/>And certes, if it n'ere too long to hear,<br/>I would have told you fully the mannere,<br/>How wonnen was the regne of Feminie,<br/>By Theseus, and by his chivalry;<br/>And of the greate battle for the nonce<br/>Betwixt Athenes and the Amazons;<br/>And how assieged was Hippolyta,<br/>The faire hardy queen of Scythia;<br/>And of the feast that was at her wedding<br/>And of the tempest at her homecoming.<br/>But all these things I must as now forbear.<br/>I have, God wot, a large field to ear<br/>And weake be the oxen in my plough;<br/>The remnant of my tale is long enow.<br/>I will not letten eke none of this rout.<br/>Let every fellow tell his tale about,<br/>And let see now who shall the supper win.<br/>There as I left, I will again begin.<br/><br/>This Duke, of whom I make mentioun,<br/>When he was come almost unto the town,<br/>In all his weal, and in his moste pride,<br/>He was ware, as he cast his eye aside,<br/>Where that there kneeled in the highe way<br/>A company of ladies, tway and tway,<br/>Each after other, clad in clothes black:<br/>But such a cry and such a woe they make,<br/>That in this world n'is creature living,<br/>That hearde such another waimenting<br/>And of this crying would they never stenten,<br/>Till they the reines of his bridle henten.<br/>"What folk be ye that at mine homecoming<br/>Perturben so my feaste with crying?"<br/>Quoth Theseus; "Have ye so great envy<br/>Of mine honour, that thus complain and cry?<br/>Or who hath you misboden, or offended?<br/>Do telle me, if it may be amended;<br/>And why that ye be clad thus all in black?"<br/><br/>The oldest lady of them all then spake,<br/>When she had swooned, with a deadly cheer,<br/>That it was ruthe for to see or hear.<br/>She saide; "Lord, to whom fortune hath given<br/>Vict'ry, and as a conqueror to liven,<br/>Nought grieveth us your glory and your honour;<br/>But we beseechen mercy and succour.<br/>Have mercy on our woe and our distress;<br/>Some drop of pity, through thy gentleness,<br/>Upon us wretched women let now fall.<br/>For certes, lord, there is none of us all<br/>That hath not been a duchess or a queen;<br/>Now be we caitives, as it is well seen:<br/>Thanked be Fortune, and her false wheel,<br/>That none estate ensureth to be wele.<br/>And certes, lord, t'abiden your presence<br/>Here in this temple of the goddess Clemence<br/>We have been waiting all this fortenight:<br/>Now help us, lord, since it lies in thy might.<br/><br/>"I, wretched wight, that weep and waile thus,<br/>Was whilom wife to king Capaneus,<br/>That starf at Thebes, cursed be that day:<br/>And alle we that be in this array,<br/>And maken all this lamentatioun,<br/>We losten all our husbands at that town,<br/>While that the siege thereabouten lay.<br/>And yet the olde Creon, wellaway!<br/>That lord is now of Thebes the city,<br/>Fulfilled of ire and of iniquity,<br/>He for despite, and for his tyranny,<br/>To do the deade bodies villainy,<br/>Of all our lorde's, which that been y-slaw,<br/>Hath all the bodies on an heap y-draw,<br/>And will not suffer them by none assent<br/>Neither to be y-buried, nor y-brent,<br/>But maketh houndes eat them in despite."<br/>And with that word, withoute more respite<br/>They fallen groff, and cryden piteously;<br/>"Have on us wretched women some mercy,<br/>And let our sorrow sinken in thine heart."<br/><br/>This gentle Duke down from his courser start<br/>With hearte piteous, when he heard them speak.<br/>Him thoughte that his heart would all to-break,<br/>When he saw them so piteous and so mate<br/>That whilom weren of so great estate.<br/>And in his armes he them all up hent,<br/>And them comforted in full good intent,<br/>And swore his oath, as he was true knight,<br/>He woulde do so farforthly his might<br/>Upon the tyrant Creon them to wreak,<br/>That all the people of Greece shoulde speak,<br/>How Creon was of Theseus y-served,<br/>As he that had his death full well deserved.<br/>And right anon withoute more abode<br/>His banner he display'd, and forth he rode<br/>To Thebes-ward, and all his, host beside:<br/>No ner Athenes would he go nor ride,<br/>Nor take his ease fully half a day,<br/>But onward on his way that night he lay:<br/>And sent anon Hippolyta the queen,<br/>And Emily her younge sister sheen<br/>Unto the town of Athens for to dwell:<br/>And forth he rit; there is no more to tell.<br/><br/>The red statue of Mars with spear and targe<br/>So shineth in his white banner large<br/>That all the fieldes glitter up and down:<br/>And by his banner borne is his pennon<br/>Of gold full rich, in which there was y-beat<br/>The Minotaur which that he slew in Crete<br/>Thus rit this Duke, thus rit this conqueror<br/>And in his host of chivalry the flower,<br/>Till that he came to Thebes, and alight<br/>Fair in a field, there as he thought to fight.<br/>But shortly for to speaken of this thing,<br/>With Creon, which that was of Thebes king,<br/>He fought, and slew him manly as a knight<br/>In plain bataille, and put his folk to flight:<br/>And by assault he won the city after,<br/>And rent adown both wall, and spar, and rafter;<br/>And to the ladies he restored again<br/>The bodies of their husbands that were slain,<br/>To do obsequies, as was then the guise.<br/><br/>But it were all too long for to devise<br/>The greate clamour, and the waimenting,<br/>Which that the ladies made at the brenning<br/>Of the bodies, and the great honour<br/>That Theseus the noble conqueror<br/>Did to the ladies, when they from him went:<br/>But shortly for to tell is mine intent.<br/>When that this worthy Duke, this Theseus,<br/>Had Creon slain, and wonnen Thebes thus,<br/>Still in the field he took all night his rest,<br/>And did with all the country as him lest.<br/>To ransack in the tas of bodies dead,<br/>Them for to strip of harness and of weed,<br/>The pillers did their business and cure,<br/>After the battle and discomfiture.<br/>And so befell, that in the tas they found,<br/>Through girt with many a grievous bloody wound,<br/>Two younge knightes ligging by and by<br/>Both in one armes, wrought full richely:<br/>Of whiche two, Arcita hight that one,<br/>And he that other highte Palamon.<br/>Not fully quick, nor fully dead they were,<br/>But by their coat-armour, and by their gear,<br/>The heralds knew them well in special,<br/>As those that weren of the blood royal<br/>Of Thebes, and of sistren two y-born.<br/>Out of the tas the pillers have them torn,<br/>And have them carried soft unto the tent<br/>Of Theseus, and he full soon them sent<br/>To Athens, for to dwellen in prison<br/>Perpetually, he n'olde no ranson.<br/>And when this worthy Duke had thus y-done,<br/>He took his host, and home he rit anon<br/>With laurel crowned as a conquerour;<br/>And there he lived in joy and in honour<br/>Term of his life; what needeth wordes mo'?<br/>And in a tower, in anguish and in woe,<br/>Dwellen this Palamon, and eke Arcite,<br/>For evermore, there may no gold them quite<br/><br/>Thus passed year by year, and day by day,<br/>Till it fell ones in a morn of May<br/>That Emily, that fairer was to seen<br/>Than is the lily upon his stalke green,<br/>And fresher than the May with flowers new<br/>(For with the rose colour strove her hue;<br/>I n'ot which was the finer of them two),<br/>Ere it was day, as she was wont to do,<br/>She was arisen, and all ready dight,<br/>For May will have no sluggardy a-night;<br/>The season pricketh every gentle heart,<br/>And maketh him out of his sleep to start,<br/>And saith, "Arise, and do thine observance."<br/><br/>This maketh Emily have remembrance<br/>To do honour to May, and for to rise.<br/>Y-clothed was she fresh for to devise;<br/>Her yellow hair was braided in a tress,<br/>Behind her back, a yarde long I guess.<br/>And in the garden at the sun uprist<br/>She walketh up and down where as her list.<br/>She gathereth flowers, party white and red,<br/>To make a sotel garland for her head,<br/>And as an angel heavenly she sung.<br/>The greate tower, that was so thick and strong,<br/>Which of the castle was the chief dungeon<br/>(Where as these knightes weren in prison,<br/>Of which I tolde you, and telle shall),<br/>Was even joinant to the garden wall,<br/>There as this Emily had her playing.<br/><br/>Bright was the sun, and clear that morrowning,<br/>And Palamon, this woful prisoner,<br/>As was his wont, by leave of his gaoler,<br/>Was ris'n, and roamed in a chamber on high,<br/>In which he all the noble city sigh,<br/>And eke the garden, full of branches green,<br/>There as this fresh Emelia the sheen<br/>Was in her walk, and roamed up and down.<br/>This sorrowful prisoner, this Palamon<br/>Went in his chamber roaming to and fro,<br/>And to himself complaining of his woe:<br/>That he was born, full oft he said, Alas!<br/>And so befell, by aventure or cas,<br/>That through a window thick of many a bar<br/>Of iron great, and square as any spar,<br/>He cast his eyes upon Emelia,<br/>And therewithal he blent and cried, Ah!<br/>As though he stungen were unto the heart.<br/>And with that cry Arcite anon up start,<br/>And saide, "Cousin mine, what aileth thee,<br/>That art so pale and deadly for to see?<br/>Why cried'st thou? who hath thee done offence?<br/>For Godde's love, take all in patience<br/>Our prison, for it may none other be.<br/>Fortune hath giv'n us this adversity'.<br/>Some wick' aspect or disposition<br/>Of Saturn, by some constellation,<br/>Hath giv'n us this, although we had it sworn,<br/>So stood the heaven when that we were born,<br/>We must endure; this is the short and plain.<br/><br/>This Palamon answer'd, and said again:<br/>"Cousin, forsooth of this opinion<br/>Thou hast a vain imagination.<br/>This prison caused me not for to cry;<br/>But I was hurt right now thorough mine eye<br/>Into mine heart; that will my bane be.<br/>The fairness of the lady that I see<br/>Yond in the garden roaming to and fro,<br/>Is cause of all my crying and my woe.<br/>I n'ot wher she be woman or goddess,<br/>But Venus is it, soothly as I guess,<br/>And therewithal on knees adown he fill,<br/>And saide: "Venus, if it be your will<br/>You in this garden thus to transfigure<br/>Before me sorrowful wretched creature,<br/>Out of this prison help that we may scape.<br/>And if so be our destiny be shape<br/>By etern word to dien in prison,<br/>Of our lineage have some compassion,<br/>That is so low y-brought by tyranny."<br/><br/>And with that word Arcita gan espy<br/>Where as this lady roamed to and fro<br/>And with that sight her beauty hurt him so,<br/>That if that Palamon was wounded sore,<br/>Arcite is hurt as much as he, or more.<br/>And with a sigh he saide piteously:<br/>"The freshe beauty slay'th me suddenly<br/>Of her that roameth yonder in the place.<br/>And but I have her mercy and her grace,<br/>That I may see her at the leaste way,<br/>I am but dead; there is no more to say."<br/>This Palamon, when he these wordes heard,<br/>Dispiteously he looked, and answer'd:<br/>"Whether say'st thou this in earnest or in play?"<br/>"Nay," quoth Arcite, "in earnest, by my fay.<br/>God help me so, me lust full ill to play."<br/>This Palamon gan knit his browes tway.<br/>"It were," quoth he, "to thee no great honour<br/>For to be false, nor for to be traitour<br/>To me, that am thy cousin and thy brother<br/>Y-sworn full deep, and each of us to other,<br/>That never for to dien in the pain ,<br/>Till that the death departen shall us twain,<br/>Neither of us in love to hinder other,<br/>Nor in none other case, my leve brother;<br/>But that thou shouldest truly farther me<br/>In every case, as I should farther thee.<br/>This was thine oath, and mine also certain;<br/>I wot it well, thou dar'st it not withsayn,<br/>Thus art thou of my counsel out of doubt,<br/>And now thou wouldest falsely be about<br/>To love my lady, whom I love and serve,<br/>And ever shall, until mine hearte sterve<br/>Now certes, false Arcite, thou shalt not so<br/>I lov'd her first, and tolde thee my woe<br/>As to my counsel, and my brother sworn<br/>To farther me, as I have told beforn.<br/>For which thou art y-bounden as a knight<br/>To helpe me, if it lie in thy might,<br/>Or elles art thou false, I dare well sayn,"<br/><br/>This Arcita full proudly spake again:<br/>"Thou shalt," quoth he, "be rather false than I,<br/>And thou art false, I tell thee utterly;<br/>For par amour I lov'd her first ere thou.<br/>What wilt thou say? thou wist it not right now<br/>Whether she be a woman or goddess.<br/>Thine is affection of holiness,<br/>And mine is love, as to a creature:<br/>For which I tolde thee mine aventure<br/>As to my cousin, and my brother sworn<br/>I pose, that thou loved'st her beforn:<br/>Wost thou not well the olde clerke's saw,<br/>That who shall give a lover any law?<br/>Love is a greater lawe, by my pan,<br/>Than may be giv'n to any earthly man:<br/>Therefore positive law, and such decree,<br/>Is broke alway for love in each degree<br/>A man must needes love, maugre his head.<br/>He may not flee it, though he should be dead,<br/>All be she maid, or widow, or else wife.<br/>And eke it is not likely all thy life<br/>To standen in her grace, no more than I<br/>For well thou wost thyselfe verily,<br/>That thou and I be damned to prison<br/>Perpetual, us gaineth no ranson.<br/>We strive, as did the houndes for the bone;<br/>They fought all day, and yet their part was none.<br/>There came a kite, while that they were so wroth,<br/>And bare away the bone betwixt them both.<br/>And therefore at the kinge's court, my brother,<br/>Each man for himselfe, there is no  other.<br/>Love if thee list; for I love and aye shall<br/>And soothly, leve brother, this is all.<br/>Here in this prison musten we endure,<br/>And each of us take his Aventure."<br/><br/>Great was the strife and long between these tway,<br/>If that I hadde leisure for to say;<br/>But to the effect: it happen'd on a day<br/>(To tell it you as shortly as I may),<br/>A worthy duke that hight Perithous<br/>That fellow was to the Duke Theseus<br/>Since thilke day that they were children lite<br/>Was come to Athens, his fellow to visite,<br/>And for to play, as he was wont to do;<br/>For in this world he loved no man so;<br/>And he lov'd him as tenderly again.<br/>So well they lov'd, as olde bookes sayn,<br/>That when that one was dead, soothly to sayn,<br/>His fellow went and sought him down in hell:<br/>But of that story list me not to write.<br/>Duke Perithous loved well Arcite,<br/>And had him known at Thebes year by year:<br/>And finally at request and prayere<br/>Of Perithous, withoute ranson<br/>Duke Theseus him let out of prison,<br/>Freely to go, where him list over all,<br/>In such a guise, as I you tellen shall<br/>This was the forword, plainly to indite,<br/>Betwixte Theseus and him Arcite:<br/>That if so were, that Arcite were y-found<br/>Ever in his life, by day or night, one stound<br/>In any country of this Theseus,<br/>And he were caught, it was accorded thus,<br/>That with a sword he shoulde lose his head;<br/>There was none other remedy nor rede.<br/>But took his leave, and homeward he him sped;<br/>Let him beware, his necke lieth to wed.<br/><br/>How great a sorrow suff'reth now Arcite!<br/>The death he feeleth through his hearte smite;<br/>He weepeth, waileth, crieth piteously;<br/>To slay himself he waiteth privily.<br/>He said; "Alas the day that I was born!<br/>Now is my prison worse than beforn:<br/>Now is me shape eternally to dwell<br/>Not in purgatory, but right in hell.<br/>Alas! that ever I knew Perithous.<br/>For elles had I dwelt with Theseus<br/>Y-fettered in his prison evermo'.<br/>Then had I been in bliss, and not in woe.<br/>Only the sight of her, whom that I serve,<br/>Though that I never may her grace deserve,<br/>Would have sufficed right enough for me.<br/>O deare cousin Palamon," quoth he,<br/>"Thine is the vict'ry of this aventure,<br/>Full blissfully in prison to endure:<br/>In prison? nay certes, in paradise.<br/>Well hath fortune y-turned thee the dice,<br/>That hast the sight of her, and I th' absence.<br/>For possible is, since thou hast her presence,<br/>And art a knight, a worthy and an able,<br/>That by some cas, since fortune is changeable,<br/>Thou may'st to thy desire sometime attain.<br/>But I that am exiled, and barren<br/>Of alle grace, and in so great despair,<br/>That there n'is earthe, water, fire, nor air,<br/>Nor creature, that of them maked is,<br/>That may me helpe nor comfort in this,<br/>Well ought I sterve in wanhope and distress.<br/>Farewell my life, my lust, and my gladness.<br/>Alas, why plainen men so in commune<br/>Of purveyance of God, or of Fortune,<br/>That giveth them full oft in many a guise<br/>Well better than they can themselves devise?<br/>Some man desireth for to have richess,<br/>That cause is of his murder or great sickness.<br/>And some man would out of his prison fain,<br/>That in his house is of his meinie slain.<br/>Infinite harmes be in this mattere.<br/>We wot never what thing we pray for here.<br/>We fare as he that drunk is as a mouse.<br/>A drunken man wot well he hath an house,<br/>But he wot not which is the right way thither,<br/>And to a drunken man the way is slither.<br/>And certes in this world so fare we.<br/>We seeke fast after felicity,<br/>But we go wrong full often truely.<br/>Thus we may sayen all, and namely I,<br/>That ween'd, and had a great opinion,<br/>That if I might escape from prison<br/>Then had I been in joy and perfect heal,<br/>Where now I am exiled from my weal.<br/>Since that I may not see you, Emily,<br/>I am but dead; there is no remedy."<br/><br/>Upon that other side, Palamon,<br/>When that he wist Arcita was agone,<br/>Much sorrow maketh, that the greate tower<br/>Resounded of his yelling and clamour<br/>The pure fetters on his shinnes great<br/>Were of his bitter salte teares wet.<br/><br/>"Alas!" quoth he, "Arcita, cousin mine,<br/>Of all our strife, God wot, the fruit is thine.<br/>Thou walkest now in Thebes at thy large,<br/>And of my woe thou givest little charge.<br/>Thou mayst, since thou hast wisdom and manhead,<br/>Assemble all the folk of our kindred,<br/>And make a war so sharp on this country<br/>That by some aventure, or some treaty,<br/>Thou mayst have her to lady and to wife,<br/>For whom that I must needes lose my life.<br/>For as by way of possibility,<br/>Since thou art at thy large, of prison free,<br/>And art a lord, great is thine avantage,<br/>More than is mine, that sterve here in a cage.<br/>For I must weep and wail, while that I live,<br/>With all the woe that prison may me give,<br/>And eke with pain that love me gives also,<br/>That doubles all my torment and my woe."<br/><br/>Therewith the fire of jealousy upstart<br/>Within his breast, and hent him by the heart<br/>So woodly, that he like was to behold<br/>The box-tree, or the ashes dead and cold.<br/>Then said; "O cruel goddess, that govern<br/>This world with binding of your word etern<br/>And writen in the table of adamant<br/>Your parlement and your eternal grant,<br/>What is mankind more unto you y-hold<br/>Than is the sheep, that rouketh in the fold!<br/>For slain is man, right as another beast;<br/>And dwelleth eke in prison and arrest,<br/>And hath sickness, and great adversity,<br/>And oftentimes guilteless, pardie<br/>What governance is in your prescience,<br/>That guilteless tormenteth innocence?<br/>And yet increaseth this all my penance,<br/>That man is bounden to his observance<br/>For Godde's sake to letten of his will,<br/>Whereas a beast may all his lust fulfil.<br/>And when a beast is dead, he hath no pain;<br/>But man after his death must weep and plain,<br/>Though in this worlde he have care and woe:<br/>Withoute doubt it maye standen so.<br/>"The answer of this leave I to divines,<br/>But well I wot, that in this world great pine is;<br/>Alas! I see a serpent or a thief<br/>That many a true man hath done mischief,<br/>Go at his large, and where him list may turn.<br/>But I must be in prison through Saturn,<br/>And eke through Juno, jealous and eke wood,<br/>That hath well nigh destroyed all the blood<br/>Of Thebes, with his waste walles wide.<br/>And Venus slay'th me on that other side<br/>For jealousy, and fear of him, Arcite."<br/><br/>Now will I stent of Palamon a lite,<br/>And let him in his prison stille dwell,<br/>And of Arcita forth I will you tell.<br/>The summer passeth, and the nightes long<br/>Increase double-wise the paines strong<br/>Both of the lover and the prisonere.<br/>I n'ot which hath the wofuller mistere.<br/>For, shortly for to say, this Palamon<br/>Perpetually is damned to prison,<br/>In chaines and in fetters to be dead;<br/>And Arcite is exiled on his head<br/>For evermore as out of that country,<br/>Nor never more he shall his lady see.<br/>You lovers ask I now this question,<br/>Who lieth the worse, Arcite or Palamon?<br/>The one may see his lady day by day,<br/>But in prison he dwelle must alway.<br/>The other where him list may ride or go,<br/>But see his lady shall he never mo'.<br/>Now deem all as you liste, ye that can,<br/>For I will tell you forth as I began.<br/><br/>When that Arcite to Thebes comen was,<br/>Full oft a day he swelt, and said, "Alas!"<br/>For see this lady he shall never mo'.<br/>And shortly to concluden all his woe,<br/>So much sorrow had never creature<br/>That is or shall be while the world may dure.<br/>His sleep, his meat, his drink is him byraft,<br/>That lean he wex, and dry as any shaft.<br/>His eyen hollow, grisly to behold,<br/>His hue sallow, and pale as ashes cold,<br/>And solitary he was, ever alone,<br/>And wailing all the night, making his moan.<br/>And if he hearde song or instrument,<br/>Then would he weepen, he might not be stent.<br/>So feeble were his spirits, and so low,<br/>And changed so, that no man coulde know<br/>His speech, neither his voice, though men it heard.<br/>And in his gear for all the world he far'd<br/>Not only like the lovers' malady<br/>Of Eros, but rather y-like manie<br/>Engender'd of humours melancholic,<br/>Before his head in his cell fantastic.<br/>And shortly turned was all upside down,<br/>Both habit and eke dispositioun,<br/>Of him, this woful lover Dan Arcite.<br/>Why should I all day of his woe indite?<br/>When he endured had a year or two<br/>This cruel torment, and this pain and woe,<br/>At Thebes, in his country, as I said,<br/>Upon a night in sleep as he him laid,<br/>Him thought how that the winged god Mercury<br/>Before him stood, and bade him to be merry.<br/>His sleepy yard in hand he bare upright;<br/>A hat he wore upon his haires bright.<br/>Arrayed was this god (as he took keep)<br/>As he was when that Argus took his sleep;<br/>And said him thus: "To Athens shalt thou wend;<br/>There is thee shapen of thy woe an end."<br/>And with that word Arcite woke and start.<br/>"Now truely how sore that e'er me smart,"<br/>Quoth he, "to Athens right now will I fare.<br/>Nor for no dread of death shall I not spare<br/>To see my lady that I love and serve;<br/>In her presence I recke not to sterve."<br/>And with that word he caught a great mirror,<br/>And saw that changed was all his colour,<br/>And saw his visage all in other kind.<br/>And right anon it ran him ill his mind,<br/>That since his face was so disfigur'd<br/>Of malady the which he had endur'd,<br/>He mighte well, if that he bare him low,<br/>Live in Athenes evermore unknow,<br/>And see his lady wellnigh day by day.<br/>And right anon he changed his array,<br/>And clad him as a poore labourer.<br/>And all alone, save only a squier,<br/>That knew his privity and all his cas,<br/>Which was disguised poorly as he was,<br/>To Athens is he gone the nexte way.<br/>And to the court he went upon a day,<br/>And at the gate he proffer'd his service,<br/>To drudge and draw, what so men would devise.<br/>And, shortly of this matter for to sayn,<br/>He fell in office with a chamberlain,<br/>The which that dwelling was with Emily.<br/>For he was wise, and coulde soon espy<br/>Of every servant which that served her.<br/>Well could he hewe wood, and water bear,<br/>For he was young and mighty for the nones,<br/>And thereto he was strong and big of bones<br/>To do that any wight can him devise.<br/><br/>A year or two he was in this service,<br/>Page of the chamber of Emily the bright;<br/>And Philostrate he saide that he hight.<br/>But half so well belov'd a man as he<br/>Ne was there never in court of his degree.<br/>He was so gentle of conditioun,<br/>That throughout all the court was his renown.<br/>They saide that it were a charity<br/>That Theseus would enhance his degree,<br/>And put him in some worshipful service,<br/>There as he might his virtue exercise.<br/>And thus within a while his name sprung<br/>Both of his deedes, and of his good tongue,<br/>That Theseus hath taken him so near,<br/>That of his chamber he hath made him squire,<br/>And gave him gold to maintain his degree;<br/>And eke men brought him out of his country<br/>From year to year full privily his rent.<br/>But honestly and slyly he it spent,<br/>That no man wonder'd how that he it had.<br/>And three year in this wise his life be lad,<br/>And bare him so in peace and eke in werre,<br/>There was no man that Theseus had so derre.<br/>And in this blisse leave I now Arcite,<br/>And speak I will of Palamon a lite.<br/><br/>In darkness horrible, and strong prison,<br/>This seven year hath sitten Palamon,<br/>Forpined, what for love, and for distress.<br/>Who feeleth double sorrow and heaviness<br/>But Palamon? that love distraineth so,<br/>That wood out of his wits he went for woe,<br/>And eke thereto he is a prisonere<br/>Perpetual, not only for a year.<br/>Who coulde rhyme in English properly<br/>His martyrdom? forsooth, it is not I;<br/>Therefore I pass as lightly as I may.<br/>It fell that in the seventh year, in May<br/>The thirde night (as olde bookes sayn,<br/>That all this story tellen more plain),<br/>Were it by a venture or destiny<br/>(As when a thing is shapen it shall be),<br/>That soon after the midnight, Palamon<br/>By helping of a friend brake his prison,<br/>And fled the city fast as he might go,<br/>For he had given drink his gaoler so<br/>Of a clary , made of a certain wine,<br/>With narcotise and opie of Thebes fine,<br/>That all the night, though that men would him shake,<br/>The gaoler slept, he mighte not awake:<br/>And thus he fled as fast as ever he may.<br/>The night was short, and faste by the day<br/>That needes cast he must himself to hide.<br/>And to a grove faste there beside<br/>With dreadful foot then stalked Palamon.<br/>For shortly this was his opinion,<br/>That in the grove he would him hide all day,<br/>And in the night then would he take his way<br/>To Thebes-ward, his friendes for to pray<br/>On Theseus to help him to warray.<br/>And shortly either he would lose his life,<br/>Or winnen Emily unto his wife.<br/>This is th' effect, and his intention plain.<br/><br/>Now will I turn to Arcita again,<br/>That little wist how nighe was his care,<br/>Till that Fortune had brought him in the snare.<br/>The busy lark, the messenger of day,<br/>Saluteth in her song the morning gray;<br/>And fiery Phoebus riseth up so bright,<br/>That all the orient laugheth at the sight,<br/>And with his streames drieth in the greves<br/>The silver droppes, hanging on the leaves;<br/>And Arcite, that is in the court royal<br/>With Theseus, his squier principal,<br/>Is ris'n, and looketh on the merry day.<br/>And for to do his observance to May,<br/>Remembering the point of his desire,<br/>He on his courser, starting as the fire,<br/>Is ridden to the fieldes him to play,<br/>Out of the court, were it a mile or tway.<br/>And to the grove, of which I have you told,<br/>By a venture his way began to hold,<br/>To make him a garland of the greves,<br/>Were it of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves,<br/>And loud he sang against the sun so sheen.<br/>"O May, with all thy flowers and thy green,<br/>Right welcome be thou, faire freshe May,<br/>I hope that I some green here getten may."<br/>And from his courser, with a lusty heart,<br/>Into the grove full hastily he start,<br/>And in a path he roamed up and down,<br/>There as by aventure this Palamon<br/>Was in a bush, that no man might him see,<br/>For sore afeard of his death was he.<br/>Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite;<br/>God wot he would have trowed it full lite.<br/>But sooth is said, gone since full many years,<br/>The field hath eyen, and the wood hath ears,<br/>It is full fair a man to bear him even,<br/>For all day meeten men at unset steven.<br/>Full little wot Arcite of his fellaw,<br/>That was so nigh to hearken of his saw,<br/>For in the bush he sitteth now full still.<br/>When that Arcite had roamed all his fill,<br/>And sungen all the roundel lustily,<br/>Into a study he fell suddenly,<br/>As do those lovers in their quainte gears,<br/>Now in the crop, and now down in the breres,<br/>Now up, now down, as bucket in a well.<br/>Right as the Friday, soothly for to tell,<br/>Now shineth it, and now it raineth fast,<br/>Right so can geary Venus overcast<br/>The heartes of her folk, right as her day<br/>Is gearful, right so changeth she array.<br/>Seldom is Friday all the weeke like.<br/>When Arcite had y-sung, he gan to sike,<br/>And sat him down withouten any more:<br/>"Alas!" quoth he, "the day that I was bore!<br/>How longe, Juno, through thy cruelty<br/>Wilt thou warrayen Thebes the city?<br/>Alas! y-brought is to confusion<br/>The blood royal of Cadm' and Amphion:<br/>Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man,<br/>That Thebes built, or first the town began,<br/>And of the city first was crowned king.<br/>Of his lineage am I, and his offspring<br/>By very line, as of the stock royal;<br/>And now I am so caitiff and so thrall,<br/>That he that is my mortal enemy,<br/>I serve him as his squier poorely.<br/>And yet doth Juno me well more shame,<br/>For I dare not beknow mine owen name,<br/>But there as I was wont to hight Arcite,<br/>Now hight I Philostrate, not worth a mite.<br/>Alas! thou fell Mars, and alas! Juno,<br/>Thus hath your ire our lineage all fordo<br/>Save only me, and wretched Palamon,<br/>That Theseus martyreth in prison.<br/>And over all this, to slay me utterly,<br/>Love hath his fiery dart so brenningly<br/>Y-sticked through my true careful heart,<br/>That shapen was my death erst than my shert.<br/>Ye slay me with your eyen, Emily;<br/>Ye be the cause wherefore that I die.<br/>Of all the remnant of mine other care<br/>Ne set I not the mountance of a tare,<br/>So that I could do aught to your pleasance."<br/><br/>And with that word he fell down in a trance<br/>A longe time; and afterward upstart<br/>This Palamon, that thought thorough his heart<br/>He felt a cold sword suddenly to glide:<br/>For ire he quoke, no longer would he hide.<br/>And when that he had heard Arcite's tale,<br/>As he were wood, with face dead and pale,<br/>He start him up out of the bushes thick,<br/>And said: "False Arcita, false traitor wick',<br/>Now art thou hent, that lov'st my lady so,<br/>For whom that I have all this pain and woe,<br/>And art my blood, and to my counsel sworn,<br/>As I full oft have told thee herebeforn,<br/>And hast bejaped here Duke Theseus,<br/>And falsely changed hast thy name thus;<br/>I will be dead, or elles thou shalt die.<br/>Thou shalt not love my lady Emily,<br/>But I will love her only and no mo';<br/>For I am Palamon thy mortal foe.<br/>And though I have no weapon in this place,<br/>But out of prison am astart by grace,<br/>I dreade not that either thou shalt die,<br/>Or else thou shalt not loven Emily.<br/>Choose which thou wilt, for thou shalt not astart."<br/><br/>This Arcite then, with full dispiteous heart,<br/>When he him knew, and had his tale heard,<br/>As fierce as lion pulled out a swerd,<br/>And saide thus; "By God that sitt'th above,<br/>N'ere it that thou art sick, and wood for love,<br/>And eke that thou no weap'n hast in this place,<br/>Thou should'st never out of this grove pace,<br/>That thou ne shouldest dien of mine hand.<br/>For I defy the surety and the band,<br/>Which that thou sayest I have made to thee.<br/>What? very fool, think well that love is free;<br/>And I will love her maugre all thy might.<br/>But, for thou art a worthy gentle knight,<br/>And wilnest to darraine her by bataille,<br/>Have here my troth, to-morrow I will not fail,<br/>Without weeting of any other wight,<br/>That here I will be founden as a knight,<br/>And bringe harness right enough for thee;<br/>And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.<br/>And meat and drinke this night will I bring<br/>Enough for thee, and clothes for thy bedding.<br/>And if so be that thou my lady win,<br/>And slay me in this wood that I am in,<br/>Thou may'st well have thy lady as for me."<br/>This Palamon answer'd, "I grant it thee."<br/>And thus they be departed till the morrow,<br/>When each of them hath laid his faith to borrow.<br/><br/>O Cupid, out of alle charity!<br/>O Regne that wilt no fellow have with thee!<br/>Full sooth is said, that love nor lordeship<br/>Will not, his thanks, have any fellowship.<br/>Well finden that Arcite and Palamon.<br/>Arcite is ridd anon unto the town,<br/>And on the morrow, ere it were daylight,<br/>Full privily two harness hath he dight,<br/>Both suffisant and meete to darraine<br/>The battle in the field betwixt them twain.<br/>And on his horse, alone as he was born,<br/>He carrieth all this harness him beforn;<br/>And in the grove, at time and place y-set,<br/>This Arcite and this Palamon be met.<br/>Then change gan the colour of their face;<br/>Right as the hunter in the regne of Thrace<br/>That standeth at a gappe with a spear<br/>When hunted is the lion or the bear,<br/>And heareth him come rushing in the greves,<br/>And breaking both the boughes and the leaves,<br/>Thinketh, "Here comes my mortal enemy,<br/>Withoute fail, he must be dead or I;<br/>For either I must slay him at the gap;<br/>Or he must slay me, if that me mishap:"<br/>So fared they, in changing of their hue<br/>As far as either of them other knew.<br/>There was no good day, and no saluting,<br/>But straight, withoute wordes rehearsing,<br/>Evereach of them holp to arm the other,<br/>As friendly, as he were his owen brother.<br/>And after that, with sharpe speares strong<br/>They foined each at other wonder long.<br/>Thou mightest weene, that this Palamon<br/>In fighting were as a wood lion,<br/>And as a cruel tiger was Arcite:<br/>As wilde boars gan they together smite,<br/>That froth as white as foam, for ire wood.<br/>Up to the ancle fought they in their blood.<br/>And in this wise I let them fighting dwell,<br/>And forth I will of Theseus you tell.<br/><br/>The Destiny, minister general,<br/>That executeth in the world o'er all<br/>The purveyance, that God hath seen beforn;<br/>So strong it is, that though the world had sworn<br/>The contrary of a thing by yea or nay,<br/>Yet some time it shall fallen on a day<br/>That falleth not eft in a thousand year.<br/>For certainly our appetites here,<br/>Be it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,<br/>All is this ruled by the sight above.<br/>This mean I now by mighty Theseus,<br/>That for to hunten is so desirous --<br/>And namely the greate hart in May --<br/>That in his bed there dawneth him no day<br/>That he n'is clad, and ready for to ride<br/>With hunt and horn, and houndes him beside.<br/>For in his hunting hath he such delight,<br/>That it is all his joy and appetite<br/>To be himself the greate harte's bane<br/>For after Mars he serveth now Diane.<br/>Clear was the day, as I have told ere this,<br/>And Theseus, with alle joy and bliss,<br/>With his Hippolyta, the faire queen,<br/>And Emily, y-clothed all in green,<br/>On hunting be they ridden royally.<br/>And to the grove, that stood there faste by,<br/>In which there was an hart, as men him told,<br/>Duke Theseus the straighte way doth hold,<br/>And to the laund he rideth him full right,<br/>There was the hart y-wont to have his flight,<br/>And over a brook, and so forth on his way.<br/>This Duke will have a course at him or tway<br/>With houndes, such as him lust to command.<br/>And when this Duke was come to the laund,<br/>Under the sun he looked, and anon<br/>He was ware of Arcite and Palamon,<br/>That foughte breme, as it were bulles two.<br/>The brighte swordes wente to and fro<br/>So hideously, that with the leaste stroke<br/>It seemed that it woulde fell an oak,<br/>But what they were, nothing yet he wote.<br/>This Duke his courser with his spurres smote,<br/>And at a start he was betwixt them two,<br/>And pulled out a sword and cried, "Ho!<br/>No more, on pain of losing of your head.<br/>By mighty Mars, he shall anon be dead<br/>That smiteth any stroke, that I may see!<br/>But tell to me what mister men ye be,<br/>That be so hardy for to fighte here<br/>Withoute judge or other officer,<br/>As though it were in listes royally.<br/>This Palamon answered hastily,<br/>And saide: "Sir, what needeth wordes mo'?<br/>We have the death deserved bothe two,<br/>Two woful wretches be we, and caitives,<br/>That be accumbered of our own lives,<br/>And as thou art a rightful lord and judge,<br/>So give us neither mercy nor refuge.<br/>And slay me first, for sainte charity,<br/>But slay my fellow eke as well as me.<br/>Or slay him first; for, though thou know it lite,<br/>This is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite<br/>That from thy land is banisht on his head,<br/>For which he hath deserved to be dead.<br/>For this is he that came unto thy gate<br/>And saide, that he highte Philostrate.<br/>Thus hath he japed thee full many year,<br/>And thou hast made of him thy chief esquier;<br/>And this is he, that loveth Emily.<br/>For since the day is come that I shall die<br/>I make pleinly my confession,<br/>That I am thilke woful Palamon,<br/>That hath thy prison broken wickedly.<br/>I am thy mortal foe, and it am I<br/>That so hot loveth Emily the bright,<br/>That I would die here present in her sight.<br/>Therefore I aske death and my jewise.<br/>But slay my fellow eke in the same wise,<br/>For both we have deserved to be slain."<br/><br/>This worthy Duke answer'd anon again,<br/>And said, "This is a short conclusion.<br/>Your own mouth, by your own confession<br/>Hath damned you, and I will it record;<br/>It needeth not to pain you with the cord;<br/>Ye shall be dead, by mighty Mars the Red.<br/><br/>The queen anon for very womanhead<br/>Began to weep, and so did Emily,<br/>And all the ladies in the company.<br/>Great pity was it as it thought them all,<br/>That ever such a chance should befall,<br/>For gentle men they were, of great estate,<br/>And nothing but for love was this debate<br/>They saw their bloody woundes wide and sore,<br/>And cried all at once, both less and more,<br/>"Have mercy, Lord, upon us women all."<br/>And on their bare knees adown they fall<br/>And would have kissed his feet there as he stood,<br/>Till at the last aslaked was his mood<br/>(For pity runneth soon in gentle heart);<br/>And though at first for ire he quoke and start<br/>He hath consider'd shortly in a clause<br/>The trespass of them both, and eke the cause:<br/>And although that his ire their guilt accused<br/>Yet in his reason he them both excused;<br/>As thus; he thoughte well that every man<br/>Will help himself in love if that he can,<br/>And eke deliver himself out of prison.<br/>Of women, for they wepten ever-in-one:<br/>And eke his hearte had compassion<br/>And in his gentle heart he thought anon,<br/>And soft unto himself he saide: "Fie<br/>Upon a lord that will have no mercy,<br/>But be a lion both in word and deed,<br/>To them that be in repentance and dread,<br/>As well as-to a proud dispiteous man<br/>That will maintaine what he first began.<br/>That lord hath little of discretion,<br/>That in such case can no division:<br/>But weigheth pride and humbless after one."<br/>And shortly, when his ire is thus agone,<br/>He gan to look on them with eyen light,<br/>And spake these same wordes all on height.<br/><br/>"The god of love, ah! benedicite,<br/>How mighty and how great a lord is he!<br/>Against his might there gaine none obstacles,<br/>He may be called a god for his miracles<br/>For he can maken at his owen guise<br/>Of every heart, as that him list devise.<br/>Lo here this Arcite, and this Palamon,<br/>That quietly were out of my prison,<br/>And might have lived in Thebes royally,<br/>And weet I am their mortal enemy,<br/>And that their death li'th in my might also,<br/>And yet hath love, maugre their eyen two,<br/>Y-brought them hither bothe for to die.<br/>Now look ye, is not this an high folly?<br/>Who may not be a fool, if but he love?<br/>Behold, for Godde's sake that sits above,<br/>See how they bleed! be they not well array'd?<br/>Thus hath their lord, the god of love, them paid<br/>Their wages and their fees for their service;<br/>And yet they weene for to be full wise,<br/>That serve love, for aught that may befall.<br/>But this is yet the beste game of all,<br/>That she, for whom they have this jealousy,<br/>Can them therefor as muchel thank as me.<br/>She wot no more of all this hote fare,<br/>By God, than wot a cuckoo or an hare.<br/>But all must be assayed hot or cold;<br/>A man must be a fool, or young or old;<br/>I wot it by myself full yore agone:<br/>For in my time a servant was I one.<br/>And therefore since I know of love's pain,<br/>And wot how sore it can a man distrain,<br/>As he that oft hath been caught in his last,<br/>I you forgive wholly this trespass,<br/>At request of the queen that kneeleth here,<br/>And eke of Emily, my sister dear.<br/>And ye shall both anon unto me swear,<br/>That never more ye shall my country dere<br/>Nor make war upon me night nor day,<br/>But be my friends in alle that ye may.<br/>I you forgive this trespass every deal.<br/>And they him sware his asking fair and well,<br/>And him of lordship and of mercy pray'd,<br/>And he them granted grace, and thus he said:<br/><br/>"To speak of royal lineage and richess,<br/>Though that she were a queen or a princess,<br/>Each of you both is worthy doubteless<br/>To wedde when time is; but natheless<br/>I speak as for my sister Emily,<br/>For whom ye have this strife and jealousy,<br/>Ye wot yourselves, she may not wed the two<br/>At once, although ye fight for evermo:<br/>But one of you, all be him loth or lief,<br/>He must go pipe into an ivy leaf:<br/>This is to say, she may not have you both,<br/>All be ye never so jealous, nor so wroth.<br/>And therefore I you put in this degree,<br/>That each of you shall have his destiny<br/>As him is shape; and hearken in what wise<br/>Lo hear your end of that I shall devise.<br/>My will is this, for plain conclusion<br/>Withouten any replication,<br/>If that you liketh, take it for the best,<br/>That evereach of you shall go where him lest,<br/>Freely without ransom or danger;<br/>And this day fifty weekes, farre ne nerre,<br/>Evereach of you shall bring an hundred knights,<br/>Armed for listes up at alle rights<br/>All ready to darraine her by bataille,<br/>And this behete I you withoute fail<br/>Upon my troth, and as I am a knight,<br/>That whether of you bothe that hath might,<br/>That is to say, that whether he or thou<br/>May with his hundred, as I spake of now,<br/>Slay his contrary, or out of listes drive,<br/>Him shall I given Emily to wive,<br/>To whom that fortune gives so fair a grace.<br/>The listes shall I make here in this place.<br/>And God so wisly on my soule rue,<br/>As I shall even judge be and true.<br/>Ye shall none other ende with me maken<br/>Than one of you shalle be dead or taken.<br/>And if you thinketh this is well y-said,<br/>Say your advice, and hold yourselves apaid.<br/>This is your end, and your conclusion."<br/>Who looketh lightly now but Palamon?<br/>Who springeth up for joye but Arcite?<br/>Who could it tell, or who could it indite,<br/>The joye that is maked in the place<br/>When Theseus hath done so fair a grace?<br/>But down on knees went every manner wight,<br/>And thanked him with all their heartes' might,<br/>And namely these Thebans ofte sithe.<br/>And thus with good hope and with hearte blithe<br/>They take their leave, and homeward gan they ride<br/>To Thebes-ward, with his old walles wide.<br/><br/>I trow men woulde deem it negligence,<br/>If I forgot to telle the dispence<br/>Of Theseus, that went so busily<br/>To maken up the listes royally,<br/>That such a noble theatre as it was,<br/>I dare well say, in all this world there n'as.<br/>The circuit a mile was about,<br/>Walled of stone, and ditched all without.<br/>Round was the shape, in manner of compass,<br/>Full of degrees, the height of sixty pas<br/>That when a man was set on one degree<br/>He letted not his fellow for to see.<br/>Eastward there stood a gate of marble white,<br/>Westward right such another opposite.<br/>And, shortly to conclude, such a place<br/>Was never on earth made in so little space,<br/>For in the land there was no craftes-man,<br/>That geometry or arsmetrike can,<br/>Nor pourtrayor, nor carver of images,<br/>That Theseus ne gave him meat and wages<br/>The theatre to make and to devise.<br/>And for to do his rite and sacrifice<br/>He eastward hath upon the gate above,<br/>In worship of Venus, goddess of love,<br/>Done make an altar and an oratory;<br/>And westward, in the mind and in memory<br/>Of Mars, he maked hath right such another,<br/>That coste largely of gold a fother.<br/>And northward, in a turret on the wall,<br/>Of alabaster white and red coral<br/>An oratory riche for to see,<br/>In worship of Diane of chastity,<br/>Hath Theseus done work in noble wise.<br/>But yet had I forgotten to devise<br/>The noble carving, and the portraitures,<br/>The shape, the countenance of the figures<br/>That weren in there oratories three.<br/><br/>First in the temple of Venus may'st thou see<br/>Wrought on the wall,  full piteous to behold,<br/>The broken sleepes, and the sikes cold,<br/>The sacred teares, and the waimentings,<br/>The fiery strokes of the desirings,<br/>That Love's servants in this life endure;<br/>The oathes, that their covenants assure.<br/>Pleasance and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,<br/>Beauty and Youth, and Bawdry and Richess,<br/>Charms and Sorc'ry, Leasings and Flattery,<br/>Dispence, Business, and Jealousy,<br/>That wore of yellow goldes a garland,<br/>And had a cuckoo sitting on her hand,<br/>Feasts, instruments, and caroles and dances,<br/>Lust and array, and all the circumstances<br/>Of Love, which I reckon'd and reckon shall<br/>In order, were painted on the wall,<br/>And more than I can make of mention.<br/>For soothly all the mount of Citheron,<br/>Where Venus hath her principal dwelling,<br/>Was showed on the wall in pourtraying,<br/>With all the garden, and the lustiness.<br/>Nor was forgot the porter Idleness,<br/>Nor Narcissus the fair of yore agone,<br/>Nor yet the folly of King Solomon,<br/>Nor yet the greate strength of Hercules,<br/>Th' enchantments of Medea and Circes,<br/>Nor of Turnus the hardy fierce courage,<br/>The rich Croesus caitif in servage.<br/>Thus may ye see, that wisdom nor richess,<br/>Beauty, nor sleight, nor strength, nor hardiness<br/>Ne may with Venus holde champartie,<br/>For as her liste the world may she gie.<br/>Lo, all these folk so caught were in her las<br/>Till they for woe full often said, Alas!<br/>Suffice these ensamples one or two,<br/>Although I could reckon a thousand mo'.<br/><br/>The statue of Venus, glorious to see<br/>Was naked floating in the large sea,<br/>And from the navel down all cover'd was<br/>With waves green, and bright as any glass.<br/>A citole  in her right hand hadde she,<br/>And on her head, full seemly for to see,<br/>A rose garland fresh, and well smelling,<br/>Above her head her doves flickering<br/>Before her stood her sone Cupido,<br/>Upon his shoulders winges had he two;<br/>And blind he was, as it is often seen;<br/>A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen.<br/><br/>Why should I not as well eke tell you all<br/>The portraiture, that was upon the wall<br/>Within the temple of mighty Mars the Red?<br/>All painted was the wall in length and brede<br/>Like to the estres of the grisly place<br/>That hight the great temple of Mars in Thrace,<br/>In thilke cold and frosty region,<br/>There as Mars hath his sovereign mansion.<br/>In which there dwelled neither man nor beast,<br/>With knotty gnarry barren trees old<br/>Of stubbes sharp and hideous to behold;<br/>In which there ran a rumble and a sough,<br/>As though a storm should bursten every bough:<br/>And downward from an hill under a bent<br/>There stood the temple of Mars Armipotent,<br/>Wrought all of burnish'd steel, of which th' entry<br/>Was long and strait, and ghastly for to see.<br/>And thereout came a rage and such a vise,<br/>That it made all the gates for to rise.<br/>The northern light in at the doore shone,<br/>For window on the walle was there none<br/>Through which men mighten any light discern.<br/>The doors were all of adamant etern,<br/>Y-clenched overthwart and ende-long<br/>With iron tough, and, for to make it strong,<br/>Every pillar the temple to sustain<br/>Was tunne-great, of iron bright and sheen.<br/>There saw I first the dark imagining<br/>Of felony, and all the compassing;<br/>The cruel ire, as red as any glede,<br/>The picke-purse, and eke the pale dread;<br/>The smiler with the knife under the cloak,<br/>The shepen burning with the blacke smoke<br/>The treason of the murd'ring in the bed,<br/>The open war, with woundes all be-bled;<br/>Conteke with bloody knife, and sharp menace.<br/>All full of chirking was that sorry place.<br/>The slayer of himself eke saw I there,<br/>His hearte-blood had bathed all his hair:<br/>The nail y-driven in the shode at night,<br/>The colde death, with mouth gaping upright.<br/>Amiddes of the temple sat Mischance,<br/>With discomfort and sorry countenance;<br/>Eke saw I Woodness laughing in his rage,<br/>Armed Complaint, Outhees, and fierce Outrage;<br/>The carrain in the bush, with throat y-corve,<br/>A thousand slain, and not of qualm y-storve;<br/>The tyrant, with the prey by force y-reft;<br/>The town destroy'd, that there was nothing left.<br/>Yet saw I brent the shippes hoppesteres,<br/>The hunter strangled with the wilde bears:<br/>The sow freting the child right in the cradle;<br/>The cook scalded, for all his longe ladle.<br/>Nor was forgot, by th'infortune of Mart<br/>The carter overridden with his cart;<br/>Under the wheel full low he lay adown.<br/>There were also of Mars' division,<br/>The armourer, the bowyer, and the smith,<br/>That forgeth sharp swordes on his stith.<br/>And all above depainted in a tower<br/>Saw I Conquest, sitting in great honour,<br/>With thilke sharpe sword over his head<br/>Hanging by a subtle y-twined thread.<br/>Painted the slaughter was of Julius,<br/>Of cruel Nero, and Antonius:<br/>Although at that time they were yet unborn,<br/>Yet was their death depainted there beforn,<br/>By menacing of Mars, right by figure,<br/>So was it showed in that portraiture,<br/>As is depainted in the stars above,<br/>Who shall be slain, or elles dead for love.<br/>Sufficeth one ensample in stories old,<br/>I may not reckon them all, though I wo'ld.<br/><br/>The statue of Mars upon a carte stood<br/>Armed, and looked grim as he were wood,<br/>And over his head there shone two figures<br/>Of starres, that be cleped in scriptures,<br/>That one Puella, that other Rubeus.<br/>This god of armes was arrayed thus:<br/>A wolf there stood before him at his feet<br/>With eyen red, and of a man he eat:<br/>With subtle pencil painted was this story,<br/>In redouting of Mars and of his glory.<br/><br/>Now to the temple of Dian the chaste<br/>As shortly as I can I will me haste,<br/>To telle you all the descriptioun.<br/>Depainted be the walles up and down<br/>Of hunting and of shamefast chastity.<br/>There saw I how woful Calistope,<br/>When that Dian aggrieved was with her,<br/>Was turned from a woman to a bear,<br/>And after was she made the lodestar:<br/>Thus was it painted, I can say no far;<br/>Her son is eke a star as men may see.<br/>There saw I Dane  turn'd into a tree,<br/>I meane not the goddess Diane,<br/>But Peneus' daughter, which that hight Dane.<br/>There saw I Actaeon an hart y-maked,<br/>For vengeance that he saw Dian all naked:<br/>I saw how that his houndes have him caught,<br/>And freten him, for that they knew him not.<br/>Yet painted was, a little farthermore<br/>How Atalanta hunted the wild boar;<br/>And Meleager, and many other mo',<br/>For which Diana wrought them care and woe.<br/>There saw I many another wondrous story,<br/>The which me list not drawen to memory.<br/>This goddess on an hart full high was set,<br/>With smalle houndes all about her feet,<br/>And underneath her feet she had a moon,<br/>Waxing it was, and shoulde wane soon.<br/>In gaudy green her statue clothed was,<br/>With bow in hand, and arrows in a case.<br/>Her eyen caste she full low adown,<br/>Where Pluto hath his darke regioun.<br/>A woman travailing was her beforn,<br/>But, for her child so longe was unborn,<br/>Full piteously Lucina  gan she call,<br/>And saide; "Help, for thou may'st best of all."<br/>Well could he painte lifelike that it wrought;<br/>With many a florin he the hues had bought.<br/>Now be these listes made, and Theseus,<br/>That at his greate cost arrayed thus<br/>The temples, and the theatre every deal,<br/>When it was done, him liked wonder well.<br/><br/>But stint I will of Theseus a lite,<br/>And speak of Palamon and of Arcite.<br/>The day approacheth of their returning,<br/>That evereach an hundred knights should bring,<br/>The battle to darraine as I you told;<br/>And to Athens, their covenant to hold,<br/>Hath ev'reach of them brought an hundred knights,<br/>Well-armed for the war at alle rights.<br/>And sickerly there trowed many a man,<br/>That never, sithen that the world began,<br/>For to speaken of knighthood of their hand,<br/>As far as God hath maked sea and land,<br/>Was, of so few, so noble a company.<br/>For every wight that loved chivalry,<br/>And would, his thankes, have a passant name,<br/>Had prayed, that he might be of that game,<br/>And well was him, that thereto chosen was.<br/>For if there fell to-morrow such a case,<br/>Ye knowe well, that every lusty knight,<br/>That loveth par amour, and hath his might<br/>Were it in Engleland, or elleswhere,<br/>They would, their thankes, willen to be there,<br/>T' fight for a lady; Benedicite,<br/>It were a lusty sighte for to see.<br/>And right so fared they with Palamon;<br/>With him there wente knightes many one.<br/>Some will be armed in an habergeon,<br/>And in a breast-plate, and in a gipon;<br/>And some will have a pair of plates large;<br/>And some will have a Prusse shield, or targe;<br/>Some will be armed on their legges weel;<br/>Some have an axe, and some a mace of steel.<br/>There is no newe guise, but it was old.<br/>Armed they weren, as I have you told,<br/>Evereach after his opinion.<br/>There may'st thou see coming with Palamon<br/>Licurgus himself, the great king of Thrace:<br/>Black was his beard, and manly was his face.<br/>The circles of his eyen in his head<br/>They glowed betwixte yellow and red,<br/>And like a griffin looked he about,<br/>With kemped haires on his browes stout;<br/>His limbs were great, his brawns were hard and strong,<br/>His shoulders broad, his armes round and long.<br/>And as the guise was in his country,<br/>Full high upon a car of gold stood he,<br/>With foure white bulles in the trace.<br/>Instead of coat-armour on his harness,<br/>With yellow nails, and bright as any gold,<br/>He had a beare's skin, coal-black for old.<br/>His long hair was y-kempt behind his back,<br/>As any raven's feather it shone for black.<br/>A wreath of gold arm-great, of huge weight,<br/>Upon his head sate, full of stones bright,<br/>Of fine rubies and clear diamants.<br/>About his car there wente white alauns,<br/>Twenty and more, as great as any steer,<br/>To hunt the lion or the wilde bear,<br/>And follow'd him, with muzzle fast y-bound,<br/>Collars of gold, and torettes filed round.<br/>An hundred lordes had he in his rout<br/>Armed full well, with heartes stern and stout.<br/><br/>With Arcita, in stories as men find,<br/>The great Emetrius the king of Ind,<br/>Upon a steede bay trapped in steel,<br/>Cover'd with cloth of gold diapred well,<br/>Came riding like the god of armes, Mars.<br/>His coat-armour was of a cloth of Tars,<br/>Couched with pearls white and round and great<br/>His saddle was of burnish'd gold new beat;<br/>A mantelet on his shoulders hanging,<br/>Bretful of rubies red, as fire sparkling.<br/>His crispe hair like ringes was y-run,<br/>And that was yellow, glittering as the sun.<br/>His nose was high, his eyen bright citrine,<br/>His lips were round, his colour was sanguine,<br/>A fewe fracknes in his face y-sprent,<br/>Betwixte yellow and black somedeal y-ment<br/>And as a lion he his looking cast<br/>Of five and twenty year his age I cast<br/>His beard was well begunnen for to spring;<br/>His voice was as a trumpet thundering.<br/>Upon his head he wore of laurel green<br/>A garland fresh and lusty to be seen;<br/>Upon his hand he bare, for his delight,<br/>An eagle tame, as any lily white.<br/>An hundred lordes had he with him there,<br/>All armed, save their heads, in all their gear,<br/>Full richely in alle manner things.<br/>For trust ye well, that earles, dukes, and kings<br/>Were gather'd in this noble company,<br/>For love, and for increase of chivalry.<br/>About this king there ran on every part<br/>Full many a tame lion and leopart.<br/>And in this wise these lordes all and some<br/>Be on the Sunday to the city come<br/>Aboute prime, and in the town alight.<br/><br/>This Theseus, this Duke, this worthy knight<br/>When he had brought them into his city,<br/>And inned them, ev'reach at his degree,<br/>He feasteth them, and doth so great labour<br/>To easen them, and do them all honour,<br/>That yet men weene that no mannes wit<br/>Of none estate could amenden it.<br/>The minstrelsy, the service at the feast,<br/>The greate giftes to the most and least,<br/>The rich array of Theseus' palace,<br/>Nor who sate first or last upon the dais.<br/>What ladies fairest be, or best dancing<br/>Or which of them can carol best or sing,<br/>Or who most feelingly speaketh of love;<br/>What hawkes sitten on the perch above,<br/>What houndes liggen on the floor adown,<br/>Of all this now make I no mentioun<br/>But of th'effect; that thinketh me the best<br/>Now comes the point, and hearken if you lest.<br/><br/>The Sunday night, ere day began to spring,<br/>When Palamon the larke hearde sing,<br/>Although it were not day by houres two,<br/>Yet sang the lark, and Palamon right tho<br/>With holy heart, and with an high courage,<br/>Arose, to wenden on his pilgrimage<br/>Unto the blissful Cithera benign,<br/>I meane Venus, honourable and digne.<br/>And in her hour  he walketh forth a pace<br/>Unto the listes, where her temple was,<br/>And down he kneeleth, and with humble cheer<br/>And hearte sore, he said as ye shall hear.<br/><br/>"Fairest of fair, O lady mine Venus,<br/>Daughter to Jove, and spouse of Vulcanus,<br/>Thou gladder of the mount of Citheron!<br/>For thilke love thou haddest to Adon<br/>Have pity on my bitter teares smart,<br/>And take mine humble prayer to thine heart.<br/>Alas! I have no language to tell<br/>Th'effecte, nor the torment of mine hell;<br/>Mine hearte may mine harmes not betray;<br/>I am so confused, that I cannot say.<br/>But mercy, lady bright, that knowest well<br/>My thought, and seest what harm that I feel.<br/>Consider all this, and rue upon my sore,<br/>As wisly as I shall for evermore<br/>Enforce my might, thy true servant to be,<br/>And holde war alway with chastity:<br/>That make I mine avow, so ye me help.<br/>I keepe not of armes for to yelp,<br/>Nor ask I not to-morrow to have victory,<br/>Nor renown in this case, nor vaine glory<br/>Of prize of armes, blowing up and down,<br/>But I would have fully possessioun<br/>Of Emily, and die in her service;<br/>Find thou the manner how, and in what wise.<br/>I recke not but it may better be<br/>To have vict'ry of them, or they of me,<br/>So that I have my lady in mine arms.<br/>For though so be that Mars is god of arms,<br/>Your virtue is so great in heaven above,<br/>That, if you list, I shall well have my love.<br/>Thy temple will I worship evermo',<br/>And on thine altar, where I ride or go,<br/>I will do sacrifice, and fires bete.<br/>And if ye will not so, my lady sweet,<br/>Then pray I you, to-morrow with a spear<br/>That Arcita me through the hearte bear<br/>Then reck I not, when I have lost my life,<br/>Though that Arcita win her to his wife.<br/>This is th' effect and end of my prayere, --<br/>Give me my love, thou blissful lady dear."<br/>When th' orison was done of Palamon,<br/>His sacrifice he did, and that anon,<br/>Full piteously, with alle circumstances,<br/>All tell I not as now his observances.<br/>But at the last the statue of Venus shook,<br/>And made a signe, whereby that he took<br/>That his prayer accepted was that day.<br/>For though the signe shewed a delay,<br/>Yet wist he well that granted was his boon;<br/>And with glad heart he went him home full soon.<br/><br/>The third hour unequal   that Palamon<br/>Began to Venus' temple for to gon,<br/>Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily,<br/>And to the temple of Dian gan hie.<br/>Her maidens, that she thither with her lad,<br/>Th' incense, the clothes, and the remnant all<br/>That to the sacrifice belonge shall,<br/>The hornes full of mead, as was the guise;<br/>There lacked nought to do her sacrifice.<br/>Smoking the temple full of clothes fair,<br/>This Emily with hearte debonnair<br/>Her body wash'd with water of a well.<br/>But how she did her rite I dare not tell;<br/>But it be any thing in general;<br/>And yet it were a game to hearen all<br/>To him that meaneth well it were no charge:<br/>But it is good a man to be at large.<br/>Her bright hair combed was, untressed all.<br/>A coronet of green oak cerriall<br/>Upon her head was set full fair and meet.<br/>Two fires on the altar gan she bete,<br/>And did her thinges, as men may behold<br/>In Stace of Thebes , and these bookes old.<br/>When kindled was the fire, with piteous cheer<br/>Unto Dian she spake as ye may hear.<br/><br/>"O chaste goddess of the woodes green,<br/>To whom both heav'n and earth and sea is seen,<br/>Queen of the realm of Pluto dark and low,<br/>Goddess of maidens, that mine heart hast know<br/>Full many a year, and wost what I desire,<br/>To keep me from the vengeance of thine ire,<br/>That Actaeon aboughte cruelly:<br/>Chaste goddess, well wottest thou that I<br/>Desire to be a maiden all my life,<br/>Nor never will I be no love nor wife.<br/>I am, thou wost, yet of thy company,<br/>A maid, and love hunting and venery,<br/>And for to walken in the woodes wild,<br/>And not to be a wife, and be with child.<br/>Nought will I know the company of man.<br/>Now help me, lady, since ye may and can,<br/>For those three formes  that thou hast in thee.<br/>And Palamon, that hath such love to me,<br/>And eke Arcite, that loveth me so sore,<br/>This grace I pray thee withoute more,<br/>As sende love and peace betwixt them two:<br/>And from me turn away their heartes so,<br/>That all their hote love, and their desire,<br/>And all their busy torment, and their fire,<br/>Be queint, or turn'd into another place.<br/>And if so be thou wilt do me no grace,<br/>Or if my destiny be shapen so<br/>That I shall needes have one of them two,<br/>So send me him that most desireth me.<br/>Behold, goddess of cleane chastity,<br/>The bitter tears that on my cheekes fall.<br/>Since thou art maid, and keeper of us all,<br/>My maidenhead thou keep and well conserve,<br/>And, while I live, a maid I will thee serve.<br/><br/>The fires burn upon the altar clear,<br/>While Emily was thus in her prayere:<br/>But suddenly she saw a sighte quaint.<br/>For right anon one of the fire's queint<br/>And quick'd again, and after that anon<br/>That other fire was queint, and all agone:<br/>And as it queint, it made a whisteling,<br/>As doth a brande wet in its burning.<br/>And at the brandes end outran anon<br/>As it were bloody droppes many one:<br/>For which so sore aghast was Emily,<br/>That she was well-nigh mad, and gan to cry,<br/>For she ne wiste what it signified;<br/>But onely for feare thus she cried,<br/>And wept, that it was pity for to hear.<br/>And therewithal Diana gan appear<br/>With bow in hand, right as an hunteress,<br/>And saide; "Daughter, stint thine heaviness.<br/>Among the goddes high it is affirm'd,<br/>And by eternal word writ and confirm'd,<br/>Thou shalt be wedded unto one of tho<br/>That have for thee so muche care and woe:<br/>But unto which of them I may not tell.<br/>Farewell, for here I may no longer dwell.<br/>The fires which that on mine altar brenn,<br/>Shall thee declaren, ere that thou go henne,<br/>Thine aventure of love, as in this case."<br/>And with that word, the arrows in the case<br/>Of the goddess did clatter fast and ring,<br/>And forth she went, and made a vanishing,<br/>For which this Emily astonied was,<br/>And saide; "What amounteth this, alas!<br/>I put me under thy protection,<br/>Diane, and in thy disposition."<br/>And home she went anon the nexte way.<br/>This is th' effect, there is no more to say.<br/><br/>The nexte hour of Mars following this<br/>Arcite to the temple walked is<br/>Of fierce Mars, to do his sacrifice<br/>With all the rites of his pagan guise.<br/>With piteous heart and high devotion<br/>Right thus to Mars he said his orison<br/>"O stronge god, that in the regnes old<br/>Of Thrace honoured art, and lord y-hold<br/>And hast in every regne, and every land<br/>Of armes all the bridle in thine hand,<br/>And them fortunest as thee list devise,<br/>Accept of me my piteous sacrifice.<br/>If so be that my youthe may deserve,<br/>And that my might be worthy for to serve<br/>Thy godhead, that I may be one of thine,<br/>Then pray I thee to rue upon my pine,<br/>For thilke pain, and thilke hote fire,<br/>In which thou whilom burned'st for desire<br/>Whenne that thou usedest the beauty<br/>Of faire young Venus, fresh and free,<br/>And haddest her in armes at thy will:<br/>And though thee ones on a time misfill,<br/>When Vulcanus had caught thee in his las,<br/>And found thee ligging by his wife, alas!<br/>For thilke sorrow that was in thine heart,<br/>Have ruth as well upon my paine's smart.<br/>I am young and unconning, as thou know'st,<br/>And, as I trow, with love offended most<br/>That e'er was any living creature:<br/>For she, that doth me all this woe endure,<br/>Ne recketh ne'er whether I sink or fleet<br/>And well I wot, ere she me mercy hete,<br/>I must with strengthe win her in the place:<br/>And well I wot, withoute help or grace<br/>Of thee, ne may my strengthe not avail:<br/>Then help me, lord, to-morr'w in my bataille,<br/>For thilke fire that whilom burned thee,<br/>As well as this fire that now burneth me;<br/>And do that I to-morr'w may have victory.<br/>Mine be the travail, all thine be the glory.<br/>Thy sovereign temple will I most honour<br/>Of any place, and alway most labour<br/>In thy pleasance and in thy craftes strong.<br/>And in thy temple I will my banner hong,<br/>And all the armes of my company,<br/>And evermore, until that day I die,<br/>Eternal fire I will before thee find<br/>And eke to this my vow I will me bind:<br/>My beard, my hair that hangeth long adown,<br/>That never yet hath felt offension<br/>Of razor nor of shears, I will thee give,<br/>And be thy true servant while I live.<br/>Now, lord, have ruth upon my sorrows sore,<br/>Give me the victory, I ask no more."<br/><br/>The prayer stint of Arcita the strong,<br/>The ringes on the temple door that hong,<br/>And eke the doores, clattered full fast,<br/>Of which Arcita somewhat was aghast.<br/>The fires burn'd upon the altar bright,<br/>That it gan all the temple for to light;<br/>A sweete smell anon the ground up gaf,<br/>And Arcita anon his hand up haf,<br/>And more incense into the fire he cast,<br/>With other rites more and at the last<br/>The statue of Mars began his hauberk ring;<br/>And with that sound he heard a murmuring<br/>Full low and dim, that saide thus,  "Victory."<br/>For which he gave to Mars honour and glory.<br/>And thus with joy, and hope well to fare,<br/>Arcite anon unto his inn doth fare.<br/>As fain as fowl is of the brighte sun.<br/><br/>And right anon such strife there is begun<br/>For thilke granting, in the heav'n above,<br/>Betwixte Venus the goddess of love,<br/>And Mars the sterne god armipotent,<br/>That Jupiter was busy it to stent:<br/>Till that the pale Saturnus the cold,<br/>That knew so many of adventures old,<br/>Found in his old experience such an art,<br/>That he full soon hath pleased every part.<br/>As sooth is said, eld hath great advantage,<br/>In eld is bothe wisdom and usage:<br/>Men may the old out-run, but not out-rede.<br/>Saturn anon, to stint the strife and drede,<br/>Albeit that it is against his kind,<br/>Of all this strife gan a remedy find.<br/>"My deare daughter Venus," quoth Saturn,<br/>"My course, that hath so wide for to turn,<br/>Hath more power than wot any man.<br/>Mine is the drowning in the sea so wan;<br/>Mine is the prison in the darke cote,<br/>Mine the strangling and hanging by the throat,<br/>The murmur, and the churlish rebelling,<br/>The groyning, and the privy poisoning.<br/>I do vengeance and plein correction,<br/>I dwell in the sign of the lion.<br/>Mine is the ruin of the highe halls,<br/>The falling of the towers and the walls<br/>Upon the miner or the carpenter:<br/>I slew Samson in shaking the pillar:<br/>Mine also be the maladies cold,<br/>The darke treasons, and the castes old:<br/>My looking is the father of pestilence.<br/>Now weep no more, I shall do diligence<br/>That Palamon, that is thine owen knight,<br/>Shall have his lady, as thou hast him hight.<br/>Though Mars shall help his knight, yet natheless<br/>Betwixte you there must sometime be peace:<br/>All be ye not of one complexion,<br/>That each day causeth such division,<br/>I am thine ayel, ready at thy will;<br/>Weep now no more, I shall thy lust fulfil."<br/>Now will I stenten of the gods above,<br/>Of Mars, and of Venus, goddess of love,<br/>And telle you as plainly as I can<br/>The great effect, for which that I began.<br/><br/>Great was the feast in Athens thilke day;<br/>And eke the lusty season of that May<br/>Made every wight to be in such pleasance,<br/>That all that Monday jousten they and dance,<br/>And spenden it in Venus' high service.<br/>But by the cause that they shoulde rise<br/>Early a-morrow for to see that fight,<br/>Unto their reste wente they at night.<br/>And on the morrow, when the day gan spring,<br/>Of horse and harness noise and clattering<br/>There was in the hostelries all about:<br/>And to the palace rode there many a rout<br/>Of lordes, upon steedes and palfreys.<br/>There mayst thou see devising of harness<br/>So uncouth and so rich, and wrought so weel<br/>Of goldsmithry, of brouding, and of steel;<br/>The shieldes bright, the testers, and trappures<br/>Gold-hewen helmets, hauberks, coat-armures;<br/>Lordes in parements on their coursers,<br/>Knightes of retinue, and eke squiers,<br/>Nailing the spears, and helmes buckeling,<br/>Gniding of shieldes, with lainers lacing;<br/>There as need is, they were nothing idle:<br/>The foamy steeds upon the golden bridle<br/>Gnawing, and fast the armourers also<br/>With file and hammer pricking to and fro;<br/>Yeomen on foot, and knaves many one<br/>With shorte staves, thick as they may gon;<br/>Pipes, trumpets, nakeres, and clariouns,<br/>That in the battle blowe bloody souns;<br/>The palace full of people up and down,<br/>There three, there ten, holding their questioun,<br/>Divining of these Theban knightes two.<br/>Some saiden thus, some said it shall he so;<br/>Some helden with him with the blacke beard,<br/>Some with the bald, some with the thick-hair'd;<br/>Some said he looked grim, and woulde fight:<br/>He had a sparth of twenty pound of weight.<br/>Thus was the halle full of divining<br/>Long after that the sunne gan up spring.<br/>The great Theseus that of his sleep is waked<br/>With minstrelsy, and noise that was maked,<br/>Held yet the chamber of his palace rich,<br/>Till that the Theban knightes both y-lich<br/>Honoured were, and to the palace fet.<br/>Duke Theseus is at a window set,<br/>Array'd right as he were a god in throne:<br/>The people presseth thitherward full soon<br/>Him for to see, and do him reverence,<br/>And eke to hearken his hest and his sentence.<br/>An herald on a scaffold made an O,<br/>Till the noise of the people was y-do:<br/>And when he saw the people of noise all still,<br/>Thus shewed he the mighty Duke's will.<br/>"The lord hath of his high discretion<br/>Considered that it were destruction<br/>To gentle blood, to fighten in the guise<br/>Of mortal battle now in this emprise:<br/>Wherefore to shape that they shall not die,<br/>He will his firste purpose modify.<br/>No man therefore, on pain of loss of life,<br/>No manner shot, nor poleaxe, nor short knife<br/>Into the lists shall send, or thither bring.<br/>Nor short sword for to stick with point biting<br/>No man shall draw, nor bear it by his side.<br/>And no man shall unto his fellow ride<br/>But one course, with a sharp y-grounden spear:<br/>Foin if him list on foot, himself to wear.<br/>And he that is at mischief shall be take,<br/>And not slain, but be brought unto the stake,<br/>That shall be ordained on either side;<br/>Thither he shall by force, and there abide.<br/>And if so fall the chiefetain be take<br/>On either side, or elles slay his make,<br/>No longer then the tourneying shall last.<br/>God speede you; go forth and lay on fast.<br/>With long sword and with mace fight your fill.<br/>Go now your way; this is the lordes will.<br/>The voice of the people touched the heaven,<br/>So loude cried they with merry steven:<br/>God save such a lord that is so good,<br/>He willeth no destruction of blood.<br/><br/>Up go the trumpets and the melody,<br/>And to the listes rode the company<br/>By ordinance, throughout the city large,<br/>Hanged with cloth of gold, and not with sarge.<br/>Full like a lord this noble Duke gan ride,<br/>And these two Thebans upon either side:<br/><br/>And after rode the queen and Emily,<br/>And after them another company<br/>Of one and other, after their degree.<br/>And thus they passed thorough that city<br/>And to the listes came they by time:<br/>It was not of the day yet fully prime.<br/>When set was Theseus full rich and high,<br/>Hippolyta the queen and Emily,<br/>And other ladies in their degrees about,<br/>Unto the seates presseth all the rout.<br/>And westward, through the gates under Mart,<br/>Arcite, and eke the hundred of his part,<br/>With banner red, is enter'd right anon;<br/>And in the selve moment Palamon<br/>Is, under Venus, eastward in the place,<br/>With banner white, and hardy cheer and face<br/>In all the world, to seeken up and down<br/>So even without variatioun<br/>There were such companies never tway.<br/>For there was none so wise that coulde say<br/>That any had of other avantage<br/>Of worthiness, nor of estate, nor age,<br/>So even were they chosen for to guess.<br/>And in two ranges faire they them dress.<br/>When that their names read were every one,<br/>That in their number guile were there none,<br/>Then were the gates shut, and cried was loud;<br/>"Do now your devoir, younge knights proud<br/>The heralds left their pricking up and down<br/>Now ring the trumpet loud and

blood on both their sides red,<br/>Sometime an end there is of every deed<br/>For ere the sun unto the reste went,<br/>The stronge king Emetrius gan hent<br/>This Palamon, as he fought with Arcite,<br/>And made his sword deep in his flesh to bite,<br/>And by the force of twenty is he take,<br/>Unyielding, and is drawn unto the stake.<br/>And in the rescue of this Palamon<br/>The stronge king Licurgus is borne down:<br/>And king Emetrius, for all his strength<br/>Is borne out of his saddle a sword's length,<br/>So hit him Palamon ere he were take:<br/>But all for nought; he was brought to the stake:<br/>His hardy hearte might him helpe naught,<br/>He must abide when that he was caught,<br/>By force, and eke by composition.<br/>Who sorroweth now but woful Palamon<br/>That must no more go again to fight?<br/>And when that Theseus had seen that sight<br/>Unto the folk that foughte thus each one,<br/>He cried, Ho! no more, for it is done!<br/>I will be true judge, and not party.<br/>Arcite of Thebes shall have Emily,<br/>That by his fortune hath her fairly won."<br/>Anon there is a noise of people gone,<br/>For joy of this, so loud and high withal,<br/>It seemed that the listes shoulde fall.<br/><br/>What can now faire Venus do above?<br/>What saith she now? what doth this queen of love?<br/>But weepeth so, for wanting of her will,<br/>Till that her teares in the listes fill<br/>She said: "I am ashamed doubteless."<br/>Saturnus saide: "Daughter, hold thy peace.<br/>Mars hath his will, his knight hath all his boon,<br/>And by mine head thou shalt be eased soon."<br/> The trumpeters with the loud minstrelsy,<br/>The heralds, that full loude yell and cry,<br/>Be in their joy for weal of Dan Arcite.<br/>But hearken me, and stinte noise a lite,<br/>What a miracle there befell anon<br/>This fierce Arcite hath off his helm y-done,<br/>And on a courser for to shew his face<br/>He pricketh endelong the large place,<br/>Looking upward upon this Emily;<br/>And she again him cast a friendly eye<br/>(For women, as to speaken in commune,<br/>They follow all the favour of fortune),<br/>And was all his in cheer, as his in heart.<br/>Out of the ground a fire infernal start,<br/>From Pluto sent, at request of Saturn<br/>For which his horse for fear began to turn,<br/>And leap aside, and founder as he leap<br/>And ere that Arcite may take any keep,<br/>He pight him on the pummel of his head.<br/>That in the place he lay as he were dead.<br/>His breast to-bursten with his saddle-bow.<br/>As black he lay as any coal or crow,<br/>So was the blood y-run into his face.<br/>Anon he was y-borne out of the place<br/>With hearte sore, to Theseus' palace.<br/>Then was he carven out of his harness.<br/>And in a bed y-brought full fair and blive<br/>For he was yet in mem'ry and alive,<br/>And always crying after Emily.<br/><br/>Duke Theseus, with all his company,<br/>Is come home to Athens his city,<br/>With alle bliss and great solemnity.<br/>Albeit that this aventure was fall,<br/>He woulde not discomforte them all<br/>Then said eke, that Arcite should not die,<br/>He should be healed of his malady.<br/>And of another thing they were as fain.<br/>That of them alle was there no one slain,<br/>All were they sorely hurt, and namely one,<br/>That with a spear was thirled his breast-bone.<br/>To other woundes, and to broken arms,<br/>Some hadden salves, and some hadden charms:<br/>And pharmacies of herbs, and eke save<br/>They dranken, for they would their lives have.<br/>For which this noble Duke, as he well can,<br/>Comforteth and honoureth every man,<br/>And made revel all the longe night,<br/>Unto the strange lordes, as was right.<br/>Nor there was holden no discomforting,<br/>But as at jousts or at a tourneying;<br/>For soothly there was no discomfiture,<br/>For falling is not but an aventure.<br/>Nor to be led by force unto a stake<br/>Unyielding, and with twenty knights y-take<br/>One person all alone, withouten mo',<br/>And harried forth by armes, foot, and toe,<br/>And eke his steede driven forth with staves,<br/>With footmen, bothe yeomen and eke knaves,<br/>It was aretted him no villainy:<br/>There may no man clepen it cowardy.<br/>For which anon Duke Theseus let cry, --<br/>To stenten alle rancour and envy, --<br/>The gree as well on one side as the other,<br/>And either side alike as other's brother:<br/>And gave them giftes after their degree,<br/>And held a feaste fully dayes three:<br/>And conveyed the kinges worthily<br/>Out of his town a journee largely<br/>And home went every man the righte way,<br/>There was no more but "Farewell, Have good day."<br/>Of this bataille I will no more indite<br/>But speak of Palamon and of Arcite.<br/><br/>Swelleth the breast of Arcite and the sore<br/>Increaseth at his hearte more and more.<br/>The clotted blood, for any leache-craft<br/>Corrupteth and is in his bouk y-laft<br/>That neither veine blood nor ventousing,<br/>Nor drink of herbes may be his helping.<br/>The virtue expulsive or animal,<br/>From thilke virtue called natural,<br/>Nor may the venom voide, nor expel<br/>The pipes of his lungs began to swell<br/>And every lacert in his breast adown<br/>Is shent with venom and corruption.<br/>Him gaineth neither, for to get his life,<br/>Vomit upward, nor downward laxative;<br/>All is to-bursten thilke region;<br/>Nature hath now no domination.<br/>And certainly where nature will not wirch,<br/>Farewell physic: go bear the man to chirch.<br/>This all and some is, Arcite must die.<br/>For which he sendeth after Emily,<br/>And Palamon, that was his cousin dear,<br/>Then said he thus, as ye shall after hear.<br/><br/>"Nought may the woful spirit in mine heart<br/>Declare one point of all my sorrows' smart<br/>To you, my lady, that I love the most:<br/>But I bequeath  the service of my ghost<br/>To you aboven every creature,<br/>Since that my life ne may no longer dure.<br/>Alas the woe! alas, the paines strong<br/>That I for you have suffered and so long!<br/>Alas the death,  alas, mine Emily!<br/>Alas departing of our company!<br/>Alas, mine hearte's queen! alas, my wife!<br/>Mine hearte's lady, ender of my life!<br/>What is this world? what aske men to have?<br/>Now with his love, now in his colde grave<br/>Al one, withouten any company.<br/>Farewell, my sweet, farewell, mine Emily,<br/>And softly take me in your armes tway,<br/>For love of God, and hearken what I say.<br/>I have here with my cousin Palamon<br/>Had strife and rancour many a day agone,<br/>For love of you, and for my jealousy.<br/>And Jupiter so wis my soule gie,<br/>To speaken of a servant properly,<br/>With alle circumstances truely,<br/>That is to say, truth, honour, and knighthead,<br/>Wisdom, humbless, estate, and high kindred,<br/>Freedom, and all that longeth to that art,<br/>So Jupiter have of my soul part,<br/>As in this world right now I know not one,<br/>So worthy to be lov'd as Palamon,<br/>That serveth you, and will do all his life.<br/>And if that you shall ever be a wife,<br/>Forget not Palamon, the gentle man."<br/><br/>And with that word his speech to fail began.<br/>For from his feet up to his breast was come<br/>The cold of death, that had him overnome.<br/>And yet moreover in his armes two<br/>The vital strength is lost, and all ago.<br/>Only the intellect, withoute more,<br/>That dwelled in his hearte sick and sore,<br/>Gan faile, when the hearte felte death;<br/>Dusked his eyen two, and fail'd his breath.<br/>But on his lady yet he cast his eye;<br/>His laste word was; "Mercy, Emily!"<br/>His spirit changed house, and wente there,<br/>As I came never I cannot telle where.<br/>Therefore I stent, I am no divinister;<br/>Of soules find I nought in this register.<br/>Ne me list not th' opinions to tell<br/>Of them, though that they writen where they dwell;<br/>Arcite is cold, there Mars his soule gie.<br/>Now will I speake forth of Emily.<br/><br/>Shriek'd Emily, and howled Palamon,<br/>And Theseus his sister took anon<br/>Swooning, and bare her from the corpse away.<br/>What helpeth it to tarry forth the day,<br/>To telle how she wept both eve and morrow?<br/>For in such cases women have such sorrow,<br/>When that their husbands be from them y-go,<br/>That for the more part they sorrow so,<br/>Or elles fall into such malady,<br/>That at the laste certainly they die.<br/>Infinite be the sorrows and the tears<br/>Of olde folk, and folk of tender years,<br/>In all the town, for death of this Theban:<br/>For him there weepeth bothe child and man.<br/>So great a weeping was there none certain,<br/>When Hector was y-brought, all fresh y-slain,<br/>To Troy: alas! the pity that was there,<br/>Scratching of cheeks, and rending eke of hair.<br/>"Why wouldest thou be dead?" these women cry,<br/>"And haddest gold enough, and Emily."<br/>No manner man might gladden Theseus,<br/>Saving his olde father Egeus,<br/>That knew this worlde's transmutatioun,<br/>As he had seen it changen up and down,<br/>Joy after woe, and woe after gladness;<br/>And shewed him example and likeness.<br/>"Right as there died never man," quoth he,<br/>"That he ne liv'd in earth in some degree,<br/>Right so there lived never man," he said,<br/>"In all this world, that sometime be not died.<br/>This world is but a throughfare full of woe,<br/>And we be pilgrims, passing to and fro:<br/>Death is an end of every worldly sore."<br/>And over all this said he yet much more<br/>To this effect, full wisely to exhort<br/>The people, that they should them recomfort.<br/>Duke Theseus, with all his busy cure,<br/>Casteth about, where that the sepulture<br/>Of good Arcite may best y-maked be,<br/>And eke most honourable in his degree.<br/>And at the last he took conclusion,<br/>That there as first Arcite and Palamon<br/>Hadde for love the battle them between,<br/>That in that selve grove, sweet and green,<br/>There as he had his amorous desires,<br/>His complaint, and for love his hote fires,<br/>He woulde make a fire, in which th' office<br/>Of funeral he might all accomplice;<br/>And let anon command to hack and hew<br/>The oakes old, and lay them on a rew<br/>In culpons, well arrayed for to brenne.<br/>His officers with swifte feet they renne<br/>And ride anon at his commandement.<br/>And after this, Duke Theseus hath sent<br/>After a bier, and it all oversprad<br/>With cloth of gold, the richest that he had;<br/>And of the same suit he clad Arcite.<br/>Upon his handes were his gloves white,<br/>Eke on his head a crown of laurel green,<br/>And in his hand a sword full bright and keen.<br/>He laid him bare the visage on the bier,<br/>Therewith he wept, that pity was to hear.<br/>And, for the people shoulde see him all,<br/>When it was day he brought them to the hall,<br/>That roareth of the crying and the soun'.<br/>Then came this woful Theban, Palamon,<br/>With sluttery beard, and ruggy ashy hairs,<br/>In clothes black, y-dropped all with tears,<br/>And (passing over weeping Emily)<br/>The ruefullest of all the company.<br/>And inasmuch as the service should be<br/>The more noble and rich in its degree,<br/>Duke Theseus let forth three steedes bring,<br/>That trapped were in steel all glittering.<br/>And covered with the arms of Dan Arcite.<br/>Upon these steedes, that were great and white,<br/>There satte folk, of whom one bare his shield,<br/>Another his spear in his handes held;<br/>The thirde bare with him his bow Turkeis,<br/>Of brent gold was the case and the harness:<br/>And ride forth a pace with sorrowful cheer<br/>Toward the grove, as ye shall after hear.<br/><br/>The noblest of the Greekes that there were<br/>Upon their shoulders carried the bier,<br/>With slacke pace, and eyen red and wet,<br/>Throughout the city, by the master street,<br/>That spread was all with black, and wondrous high<br/>Right of the same is all the street y-wrie.<br/>Upon the right hand went old Egeus,<br/>And on the other side Duke Theseus,<br/>With vessels in their hand of gold full fine,<br/>All full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;<br/>Eke Palamon, with a great company;<br/>And after that came woful Emily,<br/>With fire in hand, as was that time the guise,<br/>To do th' office of funeral service.<br/><br/>High labour, and full great appareling<br/>Was at the service, and the pyre-making,<br/>That with its greene top the heaven raught,<br/>And twenty fathom broad its armes straught:<br/>This is to say, the boughes were so broad.<br/>Of straw first there was laid many a load.<br/>But how the pyre was maked up on height,<br/>And eke the names how the trees hight,<br/>As oak, fir, birch, asp, alder, holm, poplere,<br/>Willow, elm, plane, ash, box, chestnut, lind, laurere,<br/>Maple, thorn, beech, hazel, yew, whipul tree,<br/>How they were fell'd, shall not be told for me;<br/>Nor how the goddes rannen up and down<br/>Disinherited of their habitatioun,<br/>In which they wonned had in rest and peace,<br/>Nymphes, Faunes, and Hamadryades;<br/>Nor how the beastes and the birdes all<br/>Fledden for feare, when the wood gan fall;<br/>Nor how the ground aghast was of the light,<br/>That was not wont to see the sunne bright;<br/>Nor how the fire was couched first with stre,<br/>And then with dry stickes cloven in three,<br/>And then with greene wood and spicery,<br/>And then with cloth of gold and with pierrie,<br/>And garlands hanging with full many a flower,<br/>The myrrh, the incense with so sweet odour;<br/>Nor how Arcita lay among all this,<br/>Nor what richess about his body is;<br/>Nor how that Emily, as was the guise,<br/>Put in the fire of funeral service;<br/>Nor how she swooned when she made the fire,<br/>Nor what she spake, nor what was her desire;<br/>Nor what jewels men in the fire then cast<br/>When that the fire was great and burned fast;<br/><br/>Nor how some cast their shield, and some their spear,<br/>And of their vestiments, which that they wear,<br/>And cuppes full of wine, and milk, and blood,<br/>Into the fire, that burnt as it were wood;<br/>Nor how the Greekes with a huge rout<br/>Three times riden all the fire about<br/>Upon the left hand, with a loud shouting,<br/>And thries with their speares clattering;<br/>And thries how the ladies gan to cry;<br/>Nor how that led was homeward Emily;<br/>Nor how Arcite is burnt to ashes cold;<br/>Nor how the lyke-wake was y-hold<br/>All thilke night, nor how the Greekes play<br/>The wake-plays, ne keep I not to say:<br/>Who wrestled best naked, with oil anoint,<br/>Nor who that bare him best in no disjoint.<br/>I will not tell eke how they all are gone<br/>Home to Athenes when the play is done;<br/>But shortly to the point now will I wend,<br/>And maken of my longe tale an end.<br/><br/>By process and by length of certain years<br/>All stinted is the mourning and the tears<br/>Of Greekes, by one general assent.<br/>Then seemed me there was a parlement<br/>At Athens, upon certain points and cas:<br/>Amonge the which points y-spoken was<br/>To have with certain countries alliance,<br/>And have of Thebans full obeisance.<br/>For which this noble Theseus anon<br/>Let send after the gentle Palamon,<br/>Unwist of him what was the cause and why:<br/>But in his blacke clothes sorrowfully<br/>He came at his commandment on hie;<br/>Then sente Theseus for Emily.<br/>When they were set, and hush'd was all the place<br/>And Theseus abided had a space<br/>Ere any word came from his wise breast<br/>His eyen set he there as was his lest,<br/>And with a sad visage he sighed still,<br/>And after that right thus he said his will.<br/>"The firste mover of the cause above<br/>When he first made the faire chain of love,<br/>Great was th' effect, and high was his intent;<br/>Well wist he why, and what thereof he meant:<br/>For with that faire chain of love he bond<br/>The fire, the air, the water, and the lond<br/>In certain bondes, that they may not flee:<br/>That same prince and mover eke," quoth he,<br/>"Hath stablish'd, in this wretched world adown,<br/>Certain of dayes and duration<br/>To all that are engender'd in this place,<br/>Over the whiche day they may not pace,<br/>All may they yet their dayes well abridge.<br/>There needeth no authority to allege<br/>For it is proved by experience;<br/>But that me list declare my sentence.<br/>Then may men by this order well discern,<br/>That thilke mover stable is and etern.<br/>Well may men know, but that it be a fool,<br/>That every part deriveth from its whole.<br/>For nature hath not ta'en its beginning<br/>Of no partie nor cantle of a thing,<br/>But of a thing that perfect is and stable,<br/>Descending so, till it be corruptable.<br/>And therefore of His wise purveyance<br/>He hath so well beset his ordinance,<br/>That species of things and progressions<br/>Shallen endure by successions,<br/>And not etern, withouten any lie:<br/>This mayst thou understand and see at eye.<br/>Lo th' oak, that hath so long a nourishing<br/>From the time that it 'ginneth first to spring,<br/>And hath so long a life, as ye may see,<br/>Yet at the last y-wasted is the tree.<br/>Consider eke, how that the harde stone<br/>Under our feet, on which we tread and gon,<br/>Yet wasteth, as it lieth by the way.<br/>The broade river some time waxeth drey.<br/>The greate townes see we wane and wend.<br/>Then may ye see that all things have an end.<br/>Of man and woman see we well also, --<br/>That needes in one of the termes two, --<br/>That is to say, in youth or else in age,-<br/>He must be dead, the king as shall a page;<br/>Some in his bed, some in the deepe sea,<br/>Some in the large field, as ye may see:<br/>There helpeth nought, all go that ilke way:<br/>Then may I say that alle thing must die.<br/>What maketh this but Jupiter the king?<br/>The which is prince, and cause of alle thing,<br/>Converting all unto his proper will,<br/>From which it is derived, sooth to tell<br/>And hereagainst no creature alive,<br/>Of no degree, availeth for to strive.<br/>Then is it wisdom, as it thinketh me,<br/>To make a virtue of necessity,<br/>And take it well, that we may not eschew,<br/>And namely what to us all is due.<br/>And whoso grudgeth ought, he doth folly,<br/>And rebel is to him that all may gie.<br/>And certainly a man hath most honour<br/>To dien in his excellence and flower,<br/>When he is sicker of his goode name.<br/>Then hath he done his friend, nor him, no shame<br/>And gladder ought his friend be of his death,<br/>When with honour is yielded up his breath,<br/>Than when his name appalled is for age;<br/>For all forgotten is his vassalage.<br/>Then is it best, as for a worthy fame,<br/>To dien when a man is best of name.<br/>The contrary of all this is wilfulness.<br/>Why grudge we, why have we heaviness,<br/>That good Arcite, of chivalry the flower,<br/>Departed is, with duty and honour,<br/>Out of this foule prison of this life?<br/>Why grudge here his cousin and his wife<br/>Of his welfare, that loved him so well?<br/>Can he them thank? nay, God wot, neverdeal, --<br/>That both his soul and eke themselves offend,<br/>And yet they may their lustes not amend.<br/>What may I conclude of this longe serie,<br/>But after sorrow I rede us to be merry,<br/>And thanke Jupiter for all his grace?<br/>And ere that we departe from this place,<br/>I rede that we make of sorrows two<br/>One perfect joye lasting evermo':<br/>And look now where most sorrow is herein,<br/>There will I first amenden and begin.<br/>"Sister," quoth he, "this is my full assent,<br/>With all th' advice here of my parlement,<br/>That gentle Palamon, your owen knight,<br/>That serveth you with will, and heart, and might,<br/>And ever hath, since first time ye him knew,<br/>That ye shall of your grace upon him rue,<br/>And take him for your husband and your lord:<br/>Lend me your hand, for this is our accord.<br/>Let see now of your womanly pity.<br/>He is a kinge's brother's son, pardie.<br/>And though he were a poore bachelere,<br/>Since he hath served you so many a year,<br/>And had for you so great adversity,<br/>It muste be considered, 'lieveth me.<br/>For gentle mercy oweth to passen right."<br/>Then said he thus to Palamon the knight;<br/>"I trow there needeth little sermoning<br/>To make you assente to this thing.<br/>Come near, and take your lady by the hand."<br/>Betwixte them was made anon the band,<br/>That hight matrimony or marriage,<br/>By all the counsel of the baronage.<br/>And thus with alle bliss and melody<br/>Hath Palamon y-wedded Emily.<br/>And God, that all this wide world hath wrought,<br/>Send him his love, that hath it dearly bought.<br/>For now is Palamon in all his weal,<br/>Living in bliss, in riches, and in heal.<br/>And Emily him loves so tenderly,<br/>And he her serveth all so gentilly,<br/>That never was there worde them between<br/>Of jealousy, nor of none other teen.<br/>Thus endeth Palamon and Emily<br/>And God save all this faire company.
