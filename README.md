# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Prioress's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>"WELL said, by corpus Domini," quoth our Host;<br/>"Now longe may'st thou saile by the coast,<br/>Thou gentle Master, gentle Marinere.<br/>God give the monk a thousand last quad year!<br/>Aha! fellows, beware of such a jape.<br/>The monk put in the manne's hood an ape,<br/>And in his wife's eke, by Saint Austin.<br/>Drawe no monkes more into your inn.<br/>But now pass over, and let us seek about,<br/>Who shall now telle first of all this rout<br/>Another tale;" and with that word he said,<br/>As courteously as it had been a maid;<br/>"My Lady Prioresse, by your leave,<br/>So that I wist I shoulde you not grieve,<br/>I woulde deeme that ye telle should<br/>A tale next, if so were that ye would.<br/>Now will ye vouchesafe, my lady dear?"<br/>"Gladly," quoth she; and said as ye shall hear.<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>O Lord our Lord! thy name how marvellous<br/>Is in this large world y-spread!  (quoth she)<br/>For not only thy laude precious<br/>Performed is by men of high degree,<br/>But by the mouth of children thy bounte<br/>Performed is, for on the breast sucking<br/>Sometimes showe they thy herying.<br/><br/>Wherefore in laud, as I best can or may<br/>Of thee, and of the white lily flow'r<br/>Which that thee bare, and is a maid alway,<br/>To tell a story I will do my labour;<br/>Not that I may increase her honour,<br/>For she herselven is honour and root<br/>Of bounte, next her son, and soules' boot.<br/><br/>O mother maid, O maid and mother free!<br/>O bush unburnt, burning in Moses' sight,<br/>That ravished'st down from the deity,<br/>Through thy humbless, the ghost that in thee light;<br/>Of whose virtue, when he thine hearte light,<br/>Conceived was the Father's sapience;<br/>Help me to tell it to thy reverence.<br/><br/>Lady! thy bounty, thy magnificence,<br/>Thy virtue, and thy great humility,<br/>There may no tongue express in no science:<br/>For sometimes, Lady! ere men pray to thee,<br/>Thou go'st before, of thy benignity,<br/>And gettest us the light, through thy prayere,<br/>To guiden us unto thy son so dear.<br/><br/>My conning is so weak, O blissful queen,<br/>For to declare thy great worthiness,<br/>That I not may the weight of it sustene;<br/>But as a child of twelvemonth old, or less,<br/>That can unnethes any word express,<br/>Right so fare I; and therefore, I you pray,<br/>Guide my song that I shall of you say.<br/><br/>There was in Asia, in a great city,<br/>Amonges Christian folk, a Jewery,<br/>Sustained by a lord of that country,<br/>For foul usure, and lucre of villainy,<br/>Hateful to Christ, and to his company;<br/>And through the street men mighte ride and wend,<br/>For it was free, and open at each end.<br/><br/>A little school of Christian folk there stood<br/>Down at the farther end, in which there were<br/>Children an heap y-come of Christian blood,<br/>That learned in that schoole year by year<br/>Such manner doctrine as men used there;<br/>This is to say, to singen and to read,<br/>As smalle children do in their childhead.<br/><br/>Among these children was a widow's son,<br/>A little clergion, seven year of age,<br/>That day by day to scholay was his won,<br/>And eke also, whereso he saw th' image<br/>Of Christe's mother, had he in usage,<br/>As him was taught, to kneel adown, and say<br/>Ave Maria as he went by the way.<br/><br/>Thus had this widow her little son y-taught<br/>Our blissful Lady, Christe's mother dear,<br/>To worship aye, and he forgot it not;<br/>For sely child will always soone lear.<br/>But aye when I remember on this mattere,<br/>Saint Nicholas  stands ever in my presence;<br/>For he so young to Christ did reverence.<br/><br/>This little child his little book learning,<br/>As he sat in the school at his primere,<br/>He Alma redemptoris  hearde sing,<br/>As children learned their antiphonere;<br/>And as he durst, he drew him nere and nere,<br/>And hearken'd aye the wordes and the note,<br/>Till he the firste verse knew all by rote.<br/><br/>Nought wist he what this Latin was tosay,<br/>For he so young and tender was of age;<br/>But on a day his fellow gan he pray<br/>To expound him this song in his language,<br/>Or tell him why this song was in usage:<br/>This pray'd he him to construe and declare,<br/>Full oftentime upon his knees bare.<br/><br/>His fellow, which that elder was than he,<br/>Answer'd him thus: "This song, I have heard say,<br/>Was maked of our blissful Lady free,<br/>Her to salute, and eke her to pray<br/>To be our help and succour when we dey.<br/>I can no more expound in this mattere:<br/>I learne song, I know but small grammere."<br/><br/>"And is this song y-made in reverence<br/>Of Christe's mother?" said this innocent;<br/>Now certes I will do my diligence<br/>To conne it all, ere Christemas be went;<br/>Though that I for my primer shall be shent,<br/>And shall be beaten thries in an hour,<br/>I will it conne, our Lady to honour."<br/><br/>His fellow taught him homeward privily<br/>From day to day, till he coud it by rote,<br/>And then he sang it well and boldely<br/>From word to word according with the note;<br/>Twice in a day it passed through his throat;<br/>To schoole-ward, and homeward when he went;<br/>On Christ's mother was set all his intent.<br/><br/>As I have said, throughout the Jewery,<br/>This little child, as he came to and fro,<br/>Full merrily then would he sing and cry,<br/>O Alma redemptoris, evermo';<br/>The sweetness hath his hearte pierced so<br/>Of Christe's mother, that to her to pray<br/>He cannot stint of singing by the way.<br/><br/>Our firste foe, the serpent Satanas,<br/>That hath in Jewes' heart his waspe's nest,<br/>Upswell'd and said, "O Hebrew people, alas!<br/>Is this to you a thing that is honest,<br/>That such a boy shall walken as him lest<br/>In your despite, and sing of such sentence,<br/>Which is against your lawe's reverence?"<br/><br/>From thenceforth the Jewes have conspired<br/>This innocent out of the world to chase;<br/>A homicide thereto have they hired,<br/>That in an alley had a privy place,<br/>And, as the child gan forth by for to pace,<br/>This cursed Jew him hent, and held him fast<br/>And cut his throat, and in a pit him cast.<br/><br/>I say that in a wardrobe he him threw,<br/>Where as the Jewes purged their entrail.<br/>O cursed folk! O Herodes all new!<br/>What may your evil intente you avail?<br/>Murder will out, certain it will not fail,<br/>And namely where th' honour of God shall spread;<br/>The blood out crieth on your cursed deed.<br/><br/>O martyr souded to virginity,<br/>Now may'st thou sing, and follow ever-in-one<br/>The white Lamb celestial (quoth she),<br/>Of which the great Evangelist Saint John<br/>In Patmos wrote, which saith that they that gon<br/>Before this Lamb, and sing a song all new,<br/>That never fleshly woman they ne knew.<br/><br/>This poore widow waited all that night<br/>After her little child, but he came not;<br/>For which, as soon as it was daye's light,<br/>With face pale, in dread and busy thought,<br/>She hath at school and elleswhere him sought,<br/>Till finally she gan so far espy,<br/>That he was last seen in the Jewery.<br/><br/>With mother's pity in her breast enclosed,<br/>She went, as she were half out of her mind,<br/>To every place, where she hath supposed<br/>By likelihood her little child to find:<br/>And ever on Christ's mother meek and kind<br/>She cried, and at the laste thus she wrought,<br/>Among the cursed Jewes she him sought.<br/><br/>She freined, and she prayed piteously<br/>To every Jew that dwelled in that place,<br/>To tell her, if her childe went thereby;<br/>They saide, "Nay;" but Jesus of his grace<br/>Gave in her thought, within a little space,<br/>That in that place after her son she cried,<br/>Where he was cast into a pit beside.<br/><br/>O greate God, that preformest thy laud<br/>By mouth of innocents, lo here thy might!<br/>This gem of chastity, this emeraud,<br/>And eke of martyrdom the ruby bright,<br/>Where he with throat y-carven lay upright,<br/>He Alma Redemptoris gan to sing<br/>So loud, that all the place began to ring.<br/><br/>The Christian folk, that through the streete went,<br/>In came, for to wonder on this thing:<br/>And hastily they for the provost sent.<br/>He came anon withoute tarrying,<br/>And heried Christ, that is of heaven king,<br/>And eke his mother, honour of mankind;<br/>And after that the Jewes let he bind.<br/><br/>With torment, and with shameful death each one<br/>The provost did these Jewes for to sterve<br/>That of this murder wist, and that anon;<br/>He woulde no such cursedness observe<br/>Evil shall have that evil will deserve;<br/>Therefore with horses wild he did them draw,<br/>And after that he hung them by the law.<br/><br/>The child, with piteous lamentation,<br/>Was taken up, singing his song alway:<br/>And with honour and great procession,<br/>They crry him unto the next abbay.<br/>His mother swooning by the biere lay;<br/>Unnethes might the people that were there<br/>This newe Rachel bringe from his bier.<br/><br/>Upon his biere lay this innocent<br/>Before the altar while the masses last';<br/>And, after that, th' abbot with his convent<br/>Have sped them for to bury him full fast;<br/>And when they holy water on him cast,<br/>Yet spake this child, when sprinkled was the water,<br/>And sang, O Alma redemptoris mater!<br/><br/>This abbot, which that was a holy man,<br/>As monkes be, or elles ought to be,<br/>This younger child to conjure he began,<br/>And said; "O deare child! I halse thee,<br/>In virtue of the holy Trinity;<br/>Tell me what is thy cause for to sing,<br/>Since that thy throat is cut, to my seeming."<br/><br/>"My throat is cut unto my necke-bone,"<br/>Saide this child, "and, as by way of kind,<br/>I should have died, yea long time agone;<br/>But Jesus Christ, as ye in bookes find,<br/>Will that his glory last and be in mind;<br/>And, for the worship of his mother dear,<br/>Yet may I sing O Alma loud and clear.<br/><br/>"This well of mercy, Christe's mother sweet,<br/>I loved alway, after my conning:<br/>And when that I my life should forlete,<br/>To me she came, and bade me for to sing<br/>This anthem verily in my dying,<br/>As ye have heard; and, when that I had sung,<br/>Me thought she laid a grain upon my tongue.<br/><br/>"Wherefore I sing, and sing I must certain,<br/>In honour of that blissful maiden free,<br/>Till from my tongue off taken is the grain.<br/>And after that thus saide she to me;<br/>'My little child, then will I fetche thee,<br/>When that the grain is from thy tongue take:<br/>Be not aghast, I will thee not forsake.'"<br/><br/>This holy monk, this abbot him mean I,<br/>His tongue out caught, and took away the grain;<br/>And he gave up the ghost full softely.<br/>And when this abbot had this wonder seen,<br/>His salte teares trickled down as rain:<br/>And groff he fell all flat upon the ground,<br/>And still he lay, as he had been y-bound.<br/><br/>The convent lay eke on the pavement<br/>Weeping, and herying Christ's mother dear.<br/>And after that they rose, and forth they went,<br/>And took away this martyr from his bier,<br/>And in a tomb of marble stones clear<br/>Enclosed they his little body sweet;<br/>Where he is now, God lene us for to meet.<br/><br/>O younge Hugh of Lincoln! slain also<br/>With cursed Jewes, -- as it is notable,<br/>For it is but a little while ago, --<br/>Pray eke for us, we sinful folk unstable,<br/>That, of his mercy, God so merciable<br/>On us his greate mercy multiply,<br/>For reverence of his mother Mary.
