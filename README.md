# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Nun's Priest's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>"Ho!" quoth the Knight, "good sir, no more of this;<br/>That ye have said is right enough, y-wis,<br/>And muche more; for little heaviness<br/>Is right enough to muche folk, I guess.<br/>I say for me, it is a great disease,<br/>Where as men have been in great wealth and ease,<br/>To hearen of their sudden fall, alas!<br/>And the contrary is joy and great solas,<br/>As when a man hath been in poor estate,<br/>And climbeth up, and waxeth fortunate,<br/>And there abideth in prosperity;<br/>Such thing is gladsome, as it thinketh me,<br/>And of such thing were goodly for to tell."<br/><br/>"Yea," quoth our Hoste, "by Saint Paule's bell.<br/>Ye say right sooth; this monk hath clapped loud;<br/>He spake how Fortune cover'd with a cloud<br/>I wot not what, and als' of a tragedy<br/>Right now ye heard: and pardie no remedy<br/>It is for to bewaile, nor complain<br/>That that is done, and also it is pain,<br/>As ye have said, to hear of heaviness.<br/>Sir Monk, no more of this, so God you bless;<br/>Your tale annoyeth all this company;<br/>Such talking is not worth a butterfly,<br/>For therein is there no sport nor game;<br/>Therefore, Sir Monke, Dan Piers by your name,<br/>I pray you heart'ly, tell us somewhat else,<br/>For sickerly, n'ere clinking of your bells,<br/>That on your bridle hang on every side,<br/>By heaven's king, that for us alle died,<br/>I should ere this have fallen down for sleep,<br/>Although the slough had been never so deep;<br/>Then had your tale been all told in vain.<br/>For certainly, as these clerkes sayn,<br/>Where as a man may have no audience,<br/>Nought helpeth it to telle his sentence.<br/>And well I wot the substance is in me,<br/>If anything shall well reported be.<br/>Sir, say somewhat of hunting,  I you pray."<br/><br/>"Nay," quoth the Monk, "I have no lust to play;<br/>Now let another tell, as I have told."<br/>Then spake our Host with rude speech and bold,<br/>And said unto the Nunne's Priest anon,<br/>"Come near, thou Priest, come hither, thou Sir John,<br/>Tell us such thing as may our heartes glade.<br/>Be blithe, although thou ride upon a jade.<br/>What though thine horse be bothe foul and lean?<br/>If he will serve thee, reck thou not a bean;<br/>Look that thine heart be merry evermo'."<br/><br/>"Yes, Host," quoth he, "so may I ride or go,<br/>But I be merry, y-wis I will be blamed."<br/>And right anon his tale he hath attamed<br/>And thus he said unto us every one,<br/>This sweete priest, this goodly man, Sir John.<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>A poor widow, somedeal y-stept in age,<br/>Was whilom dwelling in a poor cottage,<br/>Beside a grove, standing in a dale.<br/>This widow, of which I telle you my tale,<br/>Since thilke day that she was last a wife,<br/>In patience led a full simple life,<br/>For little was her chattel and her rent.<br/>By husbandry of such as God her sent,<br/>She found herself, and eke her daughters two.<br/>Three large sowes had she, and no mo';<br/>Three kine, and eke a sheep that highte Mall.<br/>Full sooty was her bow'r, and eke her hall,<br/>In which she ate full many a slender meal.<br/>Of poignant sauce knew she never a deal.<br/>No dainty morsel passed through her throat;<br/>Her diet was accordant to her cote.<br/>Repletion her made never sick;<br/>Attemper diet was all her physic,<br/>And exercise, and hearte's suffisance.<br/>The goute let her nothing for to dance,<br/>Nor apoplexy shente not her head.<br/>No wine drank she, neither white nor red:<br/>Her board was served most with white and black,<br/>Milk and brown bread, in which she found no lack,<br/>Seind bacon, and sometimes an egg or tway;<br/>For she was as it were a manner dey.<br/>A yard she had, enclosed all about<br/>With stickes, and a drye ditch without,<br/>In which she had a cock, hight Chanticleer;<br/>In all the land of crowing n'as his peer.<br/>His voice was merrier than the merry orgon,<br/>On masse days that in the churches gon.<br/>Well sickerer was his crowing in his lodge,<br/>Than is a clock, or an abbay horloge.<br/>By nature he knew each ascension<br/>Of th' equinoctial in thilke town;<br/>For when degrees fiftene were ascended,<br/>Then crew he, that it might not be amended.<br/>His comb was redder than the fine coral,<br/>Embattell'd  as it were a castle wall.<br/>His bill was black, and as the jet it shone;<br/>Like azure were his legges and his tone;<br/>His nailes whiter than the lily flow'r,<br/>And like the burnish'd gold was his colour,<br/>This gentle cock had in his governance<br/>Sev'n hennes, for to do all his pleasance,<br/>Which were his sisters and his paramours,<br/>And wondrous like to him as of colours.<br/>Of which the fairest-hued in the throat<br/>Was called Damoselle Partelote,<br/>Courteous she was, discreet, and debonair,<br/>And companiable, and bare herself so fair,<br/>Since the day that she sev'n night was old,<br/>That truely she had the heart in hold<br/>Of Chanticleer, locked in every lith;<br/>He lov'd her so, that well was him therewith,<br/>But such a joy it was to hear them sing,<br/>When that the brighte sunne gan to spring,<br/>In sweet accord, "My lefe is fare in land."<br/>For, at that time, as I have understand,<br/>Beastes and birdes coulde speak and sing.<br/><br/>And so befell, that in a dawening,<br/>As Chanticleer among his wives all<br/>Sat on his perche, that was in the hall,<br/>And next him sat this faire Partelote,<br/>This Chanticleer gan groanen in his throat,<br/>As man that in his dream is dretched sore,<br/>And when that Partelote thus heard him roar,<br/>She was aghast, and saide, "Hearte dear,<br/>What aileth you to groan in this mannere?<br/>Ye be a very sleeper, fy for shame!"<br/>And he answer'd and saide thus; "Madame,<br/>I pray you that ye take it not agrief;<br/>By God, me mette I was in such mischief,<br/>Right now, that yet mine heart is sore affright'.<br/>Now God," quoth he, "my sweven read aright<br/>And keep my body out of foul prisoun.<br/>Me mette, how that I roamed up and down<br/>Within our yard, where as I saw a beast<br/>Was like an hound, and would have made arrest<br/>Upon my body, and would have had me dead.<br/>His colour was betwixt yellow and red;<br/>And tipped was his tail, and both his ears,<br/>With black, unlike the remnant of his hairs.<br/>His snout was small, with glowing eyen tway;<br/>Yet of his look almost for fear I dey;<br/>This caused me my groaning, doubteless."<br/><br/>"Away,"  quoth she, "fy on you, hearteless!<br/>Alas!" quoth she, "for, by that God above!<br/>Now have ye lost my heart and all my love;<br/>I cannot love a coward, by my faith.<br/>For certes, what so any woman saith,<br/>We all desiren, if it mighte be,<br/>To have husbandes hardy, wise, and free,<br/>And secret, and no niggard nor no fool,<br/>Nor him that is aghast of every tool,<br/>Nor no avantour, by that God above!<br/>How durste ye for shame say to your love<br/>That anything might make you afear'd?<br/>Have ye no manne's heart, and have a beard?<br/>Alas! and can ye be aghast of swevenes?<br/>Nothing but vanity, God wot, in sweven is,<br/>Swevens engender of repletions,<br/>And oft of fume, and of complexions,<br/>When humours be too abundant in a wight.<br/>Certes this dream, which ye have mette tonight,<br/>Cometh of the great supefluity<br/>Of youre rede cholera, pardie,<br/>Which causeth folk to dreaden in their dreams<br/>Of arrows, and of fire with redde beams,<br/>Of redde beastes, that they will them bite,<br/>Of conteke, and of whelpes great and lite;<br/>Right as the humour of melancholy<br/>Causeth full many a man in sleep to cry,<br/>For fear of bulles, or of beares blake,<br/>Or elles that black devils will them take,<br/>Of other humours could I tell also,<br/>That worke many a man in sleep much woe;<br/>That I will pass as lightly as I can.<br/>Lo, Cato, which that was so wise a man,<br/><br/>Now, Sir," quoth she, "when we fly from these beams,<br/>For Godde's love, as take some laxatife;<br/>On peril of my soul, and of my life,<br/>I counsel you the best, I will not lie,<br/>That both of choler, and melancholy,<br/>Ye purge you; and, for ye shall not tarry,<br/>Though in this town is no apothecary,<br/>I shall myself two herbes teache you,<br/>That shall be for your health, and for your prow;<br/>And in our yard the herbes shall I find,<br/>The which have of their property by kind<br/>To purge you beneath, and eke above.<br/>Sire, forget not this for Godde's love;<br/>Ye be full choleric of complexion;<br/>Ware that the sun, in his ascension,<br/>You finde not replete of humours hot;<br/>And if it do, I dare well lay a groat,<br/>That ye shall have a fever tertiane,<br/>Or else an ague, that may be your bane,<br/>A day or two ye shall have digestives<br/>Of wormes, ere ye take your laxatives,<br/>Of laurel, centaury,  and fumeterere,<br/>Or else of elder-berry, that groweth there,<br/>Of catapuce,  or of the gaitre-berries,<br/>Or herb ivy growing in our yard, that merry is:<br/>Pick them right as they grow, and eat them in,<br/>Be merry, husband, for your father's kin;<br/>Dreade no dream; I can say you no more."<br/><br/>"Madame," quoth he, "grand mercy of your lore,<br/>But natheless, as touching Dan Catoun,<br/>That hath of wisdom such a great renown,<br/>Though that he bade no dreames for to dread,<br/>By God, men may in olde bookes read<br/>Of many a man more of authority<br/>Than ever Cato was, so may I the,<br/>That all the reverse say of his sentence,<br/>And have well founden by experience<br/>That dreames be significations<br/>As well of joy, as tribulations<br/>That folk enduren in this life present.<br/>There needeth make of this no argument;<br/>The very preve sheweth it indeed.<br/>One of the greatest authors that men read<br/>Saith thus, that whilom two fellowes went<br/>On pilgrimage in a full good intent;<br/>And happen'd so, they came into a town<br/>Where there was such a congregatioun<br/>Of people, and eke so strait of herbergage,<br/>That they found not as much as one cottage<br/>In which they bothe might y-lodged be:<br/>Wherefore they musten of necessity,<br/>As for that night, departe company;<br/>And each of them went to his hostelry,<br/>And took his lodging as it woulde fall.<br/>The one of them was lodged in a stall,<br/>Far in a yard, with oxen of the plough;<br/>That other man was lodged well enow,<br/>As was his aventure, or his fortune,<br/>That us governeth all, as in commune.<br/>And so befell, that, long ere it were day,<br/>This man mette in his bed, there: as he lay,<br/>How that his fellow gan upon him call,<br/>And said, 'Alas! for in an ox's stall<br/>This night shall I be murder'd, where I lie<br/>Now help me, deare brother, or I die;<br/>In alle haste come to me,' he said.<br/>This man out of his sleep for fear abraid;<br/>But when that he was wak'd out of his sleep,<br/>He turned him, and took of this no keep;<br/>He thought his dream was but a vanity.<br/>Thus twies in his sleeping dreamed he,<br/>And at the thirde time yet his fellaw again<br/>Came, as he thought, and said, 'I am now slaw;<br/>Behold my bloody woundes, deep and wide.<br/>Arise up early, in the morning, tide,<br/>And at the west gate of the town,' quoth he,<br/>'A carte full of dung there shalt: thou see,<br/>In which my body is hid privily.<br/>Do thilke cart arroste boldely.<br/>My gold caused my murder, sooth to sayn.'<br/>And told him every point how he was slain,<br/>With a full piteous face, and pale of hue.<br/><br/>"And, truste well, his dream he found full true;<br/>For on the morrow, as soon as it was day,<br/>To his fellowes inn he took his way;<br/>And when that he came to this ox's stall,<br/>After his fellow he began to call.<br/>The hostelere answered him anon,<br/>And saide, 'Sir, your fellow is y-gone,<br/>As soon as day he went out of the town.'<br/>This man gan fallen in suspicioun,<br/>Rememb'ring on his dreames that he mette,<br/>And forth he went, no longer would he let,<br/>Unto the west gate of the town, and fand<br/>A dung cart, as it went for to dung land,<br/>That was arrayed in the same wise<br/>As ye have heard the deade man devise;<br/>And with an hardy heart he gan to cry,<br/>'Vengeance and justice of this felony:<br/>My fellow murder'd in this same night<br/>And in this cart he lies, gaping upright.<br/>I cry out on the ministers,' quoth he.<br/>'That shoulde keep and rule this city;<br/>Harow! alas! here lies my fellow slain.'<br/>What should I more unto this tale sayn?<br/>The people out start, and cast the cart to ground<br/>And in the middle of the dung they found<br/>The deade man, that murder'd was all new.<br/>O blissful God! that art so good and true,<br/>Lo, how that thou bewray'st murder alway.<br/>Murder will out, that see we day by day.<br/>Murder is so wlatsom and abominable<br/>To God, that is so just and reasonable,<br/>That he will not suffer it heled be;<br/>Though it abide a year, or two, or three,<br/>Murder will out, this is my conclusioun,<br/>And right anon, the ministers of the town<br/>Have hent the carter, and so sore him pined,<br/>And eke the hostelere so sore engined,<br/>That they beknew their wickedness anon,<br/>And were hanged by the necke bone.<br/><br/>"Here may ye see that dreames be to dread.<br/>And certes in the same book I read,<br/>Right in the nexte chapter after this<br/>(I gabbe not, so have I joy and bliss),<br/>Two men that would, have passed over sea,<br/>For certain cause, into a far country,<br/>If that the wind not hadde been contrary,<br/>That made them in a city for to tarry,<br/>That stood full merry upon an haven side;<br/>But on a day, against the even-tide,<br/>The wind gan change, and blew right as them lest.<br/>Jolly and glad they wente to their rest,<br/>And caste them full early for to sail.<br/>But to the one man fell a great marvail<br/>That one of them, in sleeping as he lay,<br/>He mette a wondrous dream, against the day:<br/>He thought a man stood by his bedde's side,<br/>And him commanded that he should abide;<br/>And said him thus; 'If thou to-morrow wend,<br/>Thou shalt be drown'd; my tale is at an end.'<br/>He woke, and told his follow what he mette,<br/>And prayed him his voyage for to let;<br/>As for that day, he pray'd him to abide.<br/>His fellow, that lay by his bedde's side,<br/>Gan for to laugh, and scorned him full fast.<br/>'No dream,' quoth he,'may so my heart aghast,<br/>That I will lette for to do my things.<br/>I sette not a straw by thy dreamings,<br/>For swevens be but vanities and japes.<br/>Men dream all day of owles and of apes,<br/>And eke of many a maze therewithal;<br/>Men dream of thing that never was, nor shall.<br/>But since I see, that thou wilt here abide,<br/>And thus forslothe wilfully thy tide,<br/>God wot, it rueth me; and have good day.'<br/>And thus he took his leave, and went his way.<br/>But, ere that he had half his course sail'd,<br/>I know not why, nor what mischance it ail'd,<br/>But casually the ship's bottom rent,<br/>And ship and man under the water went,<br/>In sight of other shippes there beside<br/>That with him sailed at the same tide.<br/><br/>"And therefore, faire Partelote so dear,<br/>By such examples olde may'st thou lear,<br/>That no man shoulde be too reckeless<br/>Of dreames, for I say thee doubteless,<br/>That many a dream full sore is for to dread.<br/>Lo, in the life of Saint Kenelm  I read,<br/>That was Kenulphus' son, the noble king<br/>Of Mercenrike,  how Kenelm mette a thing.<br/>A little ere he was murder'd on a day,<br/>His murder in his vision he say.<br/>His norice him expounded every deal<br/>His sweven, and bade him to keep him well<br/>For treason; but he was but seven years old,<br/>And therefore little tale hath he told<br/>Of any dream, so holy was his heart.<br/>By God, I hadde lever than my shirt<br/>That ye had read his legend, as have I.<br/>Dame Partelote, I say you truely,<br/>Macrobius, that wrote the vision<br/>In Afric' of the worthy Scipion,<br/>Affirmeth dreames, and saith that they be<br/>'Warnings of thinges that men after see.<br/>And furthermore, I pray you looke well<br/>In the Old Testament, of Daniel,<br/>If he held dreames any vanity.<br/>Read eke of Joseph, and there shall ye see<br/>Whether dreams be sometimes (I say not all)<br/>Warnings of thinges that shall after fall.<br/>Look of Egypt the king, Dan Pharaoh,<br/>His baker and his buteler also,<br/>Whether they felte none effect in dreams.<br/>Whoso will seek the acts of sundry remes<br/>May read of dreames many a wondrous thing.<br/>Lo Croesus, which that was of Lydia king,<br/>Mette he not that he sat upon a tree,<br/>Which signified he shoulde hanged be?<br/>Lo here, Andromache, Hectore's wife,<br/>That day that Hector shoulde lose his life,<br/>She dreamed on the same night beforn,<br/>How that the life of Hector should be lorn,<br/>If thilke day he went into battaile;<br/>She warned him, but it might not avail;<br/>He wente forth to fighte natheless,<br/>And was y-slain anon of Achilles.<br/>But thilke tale is all too long to tell;<br/>And eke it is nigh day, I may not dwell.<br/>Shortly I say, as for conclusion,<br/>That I shall have of this avision<br/>Adversity; and I say furthermore,<br/>That I ne tell of laxatives no store,<br/>For they be venomous, I wot it well;<br/>I them defy, I love them never a del.<br/><br/>"But let us speak of mirth, and stint all this;<br/>Madame Partelote, so have I bliss,<br/>Of one thing God hath sent me large grace;<br/>For when I see the beauty of your face,<br/>Ye be so scarlet-hued about your eyen,<br/>I maketh all my dreade for to dien,<br/>For, all so sicker as In principio,<br/>Mulier est hominis confusio.<br/>Madam, the sentence of of this Latin is,<br/>Woman is manne's joy and manne's bliss.<br/>For when I feel at night your softe side, --<br/>Albeit that I may not on you ride,<br/>For that our perch is made so narrow, Alas!<br/>I am so full of joy and of solas,<br/>That I defy both sweven and eke dream."<br/>And with that word he flew down from the beam,<br/>For it was day, and eke his hennes all;<br/>And with a chuck he gan them for to call,<br/>For he had found a corn, lay in the yard.<br/>Royal he was, he was no more afear'd;<br/>He feather'd Partelote twenty time,<br/>And as oft trode her, ere that it was prime.<br/>He looked as it were a grim lion,<br/>And on his toes he roamed up and down;<br/>He deigned not to set his feet to ground;<br/>He chucked, when he had a corn y-found,<br/>And to him ranne then his wives all.<br/>Thus royal, as a prince is in his hall,<br/>Leave I this Chanticleer in his pasture;<br/>And after will I tell his aventure.<br/><br/>When that the month in which the world began,<br/>That highte March, when God first maked man,<br/>Was complete, and y-passed were also,<br/>Since March ended, thirty days and two,<br/>Befell that Chanticleer in all his pride,<br/>His seven wives walking him beside,<br/>Cast up his eyen to the brighte sun,<br/>That in the sign of Taurus had y-run<br/>Twenty degrees and one, and somewhat more;<br/>He knew by kind, and by none other lore,<br/>That it was prime, and crew with blissful steven.<br/>"The sun," he said, "is clomben up in heaven<br/>Twenty degrees and one, and more y-wis.<br/>Madame Partelote, my worlde's bliss,<br/>Hearken these blissful birdes how they sing,<br/>And see the freshe flowers how they spring;<br/>Full is mine heart of revel and solace."<br/>But suddenly him fell a sorrowful case;<br/>For ever the latter end of joy is woe:<br/>God wot that worldly joy is soon y-go:<br/>And, if a rhetor coulde fair indite,<br/>He in a chronicle might it safely write,<br/>As for a sov'reign notability<br/>Now every wise man, let him hearken me;<br/>This story is all as true, I undertake,<br/>As is the book of Launcelot du Lake,<br/>That women hold in full great reverence.<br/>Now will I turn again to my sentence.<br/><br/>A col-fox,  full of sly iniquity,<br/>That in the grove had wonned yeares three,<br/>By high imagination forecast,<br/>The same night thorough the hedges brast<br/>Into the yard, where Chanticleer the fair<br/>Was wont, and eke his wives, to repair;<br/>And in a bed of wortes still he lay,<br/>Till it was passed undern  of the day,<br/>Waiting his time on Chanticleer to fall:<br/>As gladly do these homicides all,<br/>That in awaite lie to murder men.<br/>O false murd'rer! Rouking in thy den!<br/>O new Iscariot, new Ganilion!<br/>O false dissimuler, O Greek Sinon,<br/>That broughtest Troy all utterly to sorrow!<br/>O Chanticleer! accursed be the morrow<br/>That thou into thy yard flew from the beams;<br/>Thou wert full well y-warned by thy dreams<br/>That thilke day was perilous to thee.<br/>But what that God forewot must needes be,<br/>After th' opinion of certain clerkes.<br/>Witness on him that any perfect clerk is,<br/>That in school is great altercation<br/>In this matter, and great disputation,<br/>And hath been of an hundred thousand men.<br/>But I ne cannot boult it to the bren,<br/>As can the holy doctor Augustine,<br/>Or Boece, or the bishop Bradwardine,<br/>Whether that Godde's worthy foreweeting<br/>Straineth me needly for to do a thing<br/>(Needly call I simple necessity),<br/>Or elles if free choice be granted me<br/>To do that same thing, or do it not,<br/>Though God forewot it ere that it was wrought;<br/>Or if his weeting straineth never a deal,<br/>But by necessity conditionel.<br/>I will not have to do of such mattere;<br/>My tale is of a cock, as ye may hear,<br/>That took his counsel of his wife, with sorrow,<br/>To walken in the yard upon the morrow<br/>That he had mette the dream, as I you told.<br/>Womane's counsels be full often cold;<br/>Womane's counsel brought us first to woe,<br/>And made Adam from Paradise to go,<br/>There as he was full merry and well at case.<br/>But, for I n'ot to whom I might displease<br/>If I counsel of women woulde blame,<br/>Pass over, for I said it in my game.<br/>Read authors, where they treat of such mattere<br/>And what they say of women ye may hear.<br/>These be the cocke's wordes, and not mine;<br/>I can no harm of no woman divine.<br/>Fair in the sand, to bathe her merrily,<br/>Lies Partelote, and all her sisters by,<br/>Against the sun, and Chanticleer so free<br/>Sang merrier than the mermaid in the sea;<br/>For Physiologus saith sickerly,<br/>How that they singe well and merrily.<br/>And so befell that, as he cast his eye<br/>Among the wortes, on a butterfly,<br/>He was ware of this fox that lay full low.<br/>Nothing ne list him thenne for to crow,<br/>But cried anon "Cock! cock!" and up he start,<br/>As man that was affrayed in his heart.<br/>For naturally a beast desireth flee<br/>From his contrary, if be may it see,<br/>Though he ne'er erst had soon it with his eye<br/>This Chanticleer, when he gan him espy,<br/>He would have fled, but that the fox anon<br/>Said, "Gentle Sir, alas! why will ye gon?<br/>Be ye afraid of me that am your friend?<br/>Now, certes, I were worse than any fiend,<br/>If I to you would harm or villainy.<br/>I am not come your counsel to espy.<br/>But truely the cause of my coming<br/>Was only for to hearken how ye sing;<br/>For truely ye have as merry a steven,<br/>As any angel hath that is in heaven;<br/>Therewith ye have of music more feeling,<br/>Than had Boece, or any that can sing.<br/>My lord your father (God his soule bless)<br/>And eke your mother of her gentleness,<br/>Have in mnine house been, to my great ease:<br/>And certes, Sir, full fain would I you please.<br/>But, for men speak of singing, I will say,<br/>So may I brooke well mine eyen tway,<br/>Save you, I hearde never man so sing<br/>As did your father in the morrowning.<br/>Certes it was of heart all that he sung.<br/>And, for to make his voice the more strong,<br/>He would so pain him, that with both his eyen<br/>He muste wink, so loud he woulde cryen,<br/>And standen on his tiptoes therewithal,<br/>And stretche forth his necke long and small.<br/>And eke he was of such discretion,<br/>That there was no man, in no region,<br/>That him in song or wisdom mighte pass.<br/>I have well read in Dan Burnel the Ass,<br/>Among his verse, how that there was a cock<br/>That, for a prieste's son gave him a knock<br/>Upon his leg, while he was young and nice,<br/>He made him for to lose his benefice.<br/>But certain there is no comparison<br/>Betwixt the wisdom and discretion<br/>Of youre father, and his subtilty.<br/>Now singe, Sir, for sainte charity,<br/>Let see, can ye your father counterfeit?"<br/><br/>This Chanticleer his wings began to beat,<br/>As man that could not his treason espy,<br/>So was he ravish'd with his flattery.<br/>Alas! ye lordes, many a false flattour<br/>Is in your court, and many a losengeour,<br/>That please you well more, by my faith,<br/>Than he that soothfastness unto you saith.<br/>Read in Ecclesiast' of flattery;<br/>Beware, ye lordes, of their treachery.<br/>This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,<br/>Stretching his neck, and held his eyen close,<br/>And gan to crowe loude for the nonce<br/>And Dan Russel  the fox start up at once,<br/>And by the gorge hente Chanticleer,<br/>And on his back toward the wood him bare.<br/>For yet was there no man that him pursu'd.<br/>O destiny, that may'st not be eschew'd!<br/>Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!<br/>Alas, his wife raughte nought of dreams!<br/>And on a Friday fell all this mischance.<br/>O Venus, that art goddess of pleasance,<br/>Since that thy servant was this Chanticleer<br/>And in thy service did all his powere,<br/>More for delight, than the world to multiply,<br/>Why wilt thou suffer him on thy day to die?<br/>O Gaufrid, deare master sovereign,<br/>That, when thy worthy king Richard was slain<br/>With shot, complainedest his death so sore,<br/>Why n'had I now thy sentence and thy lore,<br/>The Friday for to chiden, as did ye?<br/>(For on a Friday, soothly, slain was he),<br/>Then would I shew you how that I could plain<br/>For Chanticleere's dread, and for his pain.<br/><br/>Certes such cry nor lamentation<br/>Was ne'er of ladies made, when Ilion<br/>Was won, and Pyrrhus with his straighte sword,<br/>When he had hent king Priam by the beard,<br/>And slain him (as saith us Eneidos),<br/>As maden all the hennes in the close,<br/>When they had seen of Chanticleer the sight.<br/>But sov'reignly Dame Partelote shright,<br/>Full louder than did Hasdrubale's wife,<br/>When that her husband hadde lost his life,<br/>And that the Romans had y-burnt Carthage;<br/>She was so full of torment and of rage,<br/>That wilfully into the fire she start,<br/>And burnt herselfe with a steadfast heart.<br/>O woeful hennes! right so cried ye,<br/>As, when that Nero burned the city<br/>Of Rome, cried the senatores' wives,<br/>For that their husbands losten all their lives;<br/>Withoute guilt this Nero hath them slain.<br/>Now will I turn unto my tale again;<br/><br/>The sely widow, and her daughters two,<br/>Hearde these hennes cry and make woe,<br/>And at the doors out started they anon,<br/>And saw the fox toward the wood is gone,<br/>And bare upon his back the cock away:<br/>They cried, "Out! harow! and well-away!<br/>Aha! the fox!" and after him they ran,<br/>And eke with staves many another man<br/>Ran Coll our dog, and Talbot, and Garland;<br/>And Malkin, with her distaff in her hand<br/>Ran cow and calf, and eke the very hogges<br/>So fear'd they were for barking of the dogges,<br/>And shouting of the men and women eke.<br/>They ranne so, them thought their hearts would break.<br/>They yelled as the fiendes do in hell;<br/>The duckes cried as men would them quell;<br/>The geese for feare flewen o'er the trees,<br/>Out of the hive came the swarm of bees,<br/>So hideous was the noise, ben'dicite!<br/>Certes he, Jacke Straw, and his meinie,<br/>Ne made never shoutes half so shrill<br/>When that they woulden any Fleming kill,<br/>As thilke day was made upon the fox.<br/>Of brass they broughte beames and of box,<br/>Of horn and bone, in which they blew and pooped,<br/>And therewithal they shrieked and they hooped;<br/>It seemed as the heaven shoulde fall<br/><br/>Now, goode men, I pray you hearken all;<br/>Lo, how Fortune turneth suddenly<br/>The hope and pride eke of her enemy.<br/>This cock, that lay upon the fox's back,<br/>In all his dread unto the fox he spake,<br/>And saide, "Sir, if that I were as ye,<br/>Yet would I say (as wisly God help me),<br/>'Turn ye again, ye proude churles all;<br/>A very pestilence upon you fall.<br/>Now am I come unto the woode's side,<br/>Maugre your head, the cock shall here abide;<br/>I will him eat, in faith, and that anon.'"<br/>The fox answer'd, "In faith it shall be done:"<br/>And, as he spake the word, all suddenly<br/>The cock brake from his mouth deliverly,<br/>And high upon a tree he flew anon.<br/>And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,<br/>"Alas!" quoth he, "O Chanticleer, alas!<br/>I have," quoth he, "y-done to you trespass,<br/>Inasmuch as I maked you afear'd,<br/>When I you hent, and brought out of your yard;<br/>But, Sir, I did it in no wick' intent;<br/>Come down, and I shall tell you what I meant.<br/>I shall say sooth to you, God help me so."<br/>"Nay then," quoth he, "I shrew us both the two,<br/>And first I shrew myself, both blood and bones,<br/>If thou beguile me oftener than once.<br/>Thou shalt no more through thy flattery<br/>Do me to sing and winke with mine eye;<br/>For he that winketh when he shoulde see,<br/>All wilfully, God let him never the."<br/>"Nay," quoth the fox; "but God give him mischance<br/>That is so indiscreet of governance,<br/>That jangleth when that he should hold his peace."<br/><br/>Lo, what it is for to be reckeless<br/>And negligent, and trust on flattery.<br/>But ye that holde this tale a folly,<br/>As of a fox, or of a cock or hen,<br/>Take the morality thereof, good men.<br/>For Saint Paul saith, That all that written is,<br/>To our doctrine it written is y-wis.<br/>Take the fruit, and let the chaff be still.<br/><br/>Now goode God, if that it be thy will,<br/>As saith my Lord,  so make us all good men;<br/>And bring us all to thy high bliss. Amen.<br/><br/>THE EPILOGUE<br/><br/>"Sir Nunne's Priest," our hoste said anon,<br/>"Y-blessed be thy breech, and every stone;<br/>This was a merry tale of Chanticleer.<br/>But by my truth, if thou wert seculere,<br/>Thou wouldest be a treadefowl aright;<br/>For if thou have courage as thou hast might,<br/>Thee were need of hennes, as I ween,<br/>Yea more than seven times seventeen.<br/>See, whate brawnes hath this gentle priest,<br/>So great a neck, and such a large breast<br/>He looketh as a sperhawk with his eyen<br/>Him needeth not his colour for to dyen<br/>With Brazil, nor with grain of Portugale.<br/>But, Sir, faire fall you for your tale'."<br/>And, after that, he with full merry cheer<br/>Said to another, as ye shall hear.
