# üíÆ An Excelente Balade of Charitie: As Wroten bie the Gode Pri by *Thomas Chatterton*

<p>
    In Virgyn√´ the sweltrie sun gan sheene,<br/>And hotte upon the mees did caste his raie;<br/>The apple rodded from its palie greene,<br/>And the mole peare did bende the leafy spraie;<br/>The peede chelandri sunge the livelong daie;<br/>'Twas nowe the pride, the manhode of the yeare,<br/>And eke the grounde was dighte in its moste defte aumere.<br/><br/>The sun was glemeing in the midde of daie,<br/>Deadde still the aire, and eke the welken blue,<br/>When from the sea arist in drear arraie<br/>A hepe of cloudes of sable sullen hue,<br/>The which full fast unto the woodlande drewe,<br/>Hiltring attenes the sunnis fetive face,<br/>And the blacke tempeste swolne and gatherd up apace.<br/><br/>Beneathe an holme, faste by a pathwaie side,<br/>Which dide unto Seyncte Godwine's covent lede,<br/>A hapless pilgrim moneynge did abide.<br/>Pore in his newe, ungentle in his weede,<br/>Longe bretful of the miseries of neede,<br/>Where from the hail-stone coulde the almer flie?<br/>He had no housen theere, ne anie covent nie.<br/><br/>Look in his glommed face, his sprighte there scanne;<br/>Howe woe-be-gone, how withered, forwynd, deade!<br/>Haste to thie church-glebe-house, asshrewed manne!<br/>Haste to thie kiste, thie onlie dortoure bedde.<br/>Cale, as the claie whiche will gre on thie hedde,<br/>Is Charitie and Love aminge highe elves;<br/>Knightis and Barons live for pleasure and themselves.<br/><br/>The gatherd storme is rype; the bigge drops falle;<br/>The forswat meadowes smethe, and drenche the raine;<br/>The comyng ghastness do the cattle pall,<br/>And the full flockes are drivynge ore the plaine;<br/>Dashde from the cloudes the waters flott againe;<br/>The welkin opes; the yellow levynne flies;<br/>And the hot fierie smothe in the wide lowings dies.<br/><br/>Liste! now the thunder's rattling clymmynge sound<br/>Cheves slowlie on, and then embollen clangs,<br/>Shakes the hie spyre, and losst, dispended, drown'd,<br/>Still on the gallard eare of terroure hanges;<br/>The windes are up; the lofty elmen swanges;<br/>Again the levynne and the thunder poures,<br/>And the full cloudes are braste attenes in stonen showers.<br/><br/>Spurreynge his palfrie oere the watrie plaine,<br/>The Abbote of Seyncte Godwynes convente came;<br/>His chapournette was drented with the reine,<br/>And his pencte gyrdle met with mickle shame;<br/>He aynewarde tolde his bederoll at the same;<br/>The storme encreasen, and he drew aside,<br/>With the mist almes craver neere to the holme to bide.<br/><br/>His cope was all of Lyncolne clothe so fyne,<br/>With a gold button fasten'd neere his chynne;<br/>His autremete was edged with golden twynne,<br/>And his shoone pyke a loverds mighte have binne;<br/>Full well it shewn he thoughten coste no sinne:<br/>The trammels of the palfrye pleasde his sighte,<br/>For the horse-millanare his head with roses dighte.<br/><br/>"An almes, sir prieste!" the droppynge pilgrim saide,<br/>"O! let me waite within your covente dore,<br/>Till the sunne sheneth hie above our heade,<br/>And the loude tempeste of the aire is oer;<br/>Helpless and ould am I alas! and poor;<br/>No house, ne friend, ne moneie in my pouche;<br/>All yatte I call my owne is this my silver crouche."<br/><br/>"Varlet," replyd the Abbatte, "cease your dinne;<br/>This is no season almes and prayers to give;<br/>Mie porter never lets a faitour in;<br/>None touch mie rynge who not in honour live."<br/>And now the sonne with the blacke cloudes did stryve,<br/>And shettynge on the grounde his glairie raie,<br/>The Abbatte spurrde his steede, and eftsoones roadde awaie.<br/><br/>Once moe the skie was blacke, the thunder rolde;<br/>Faste reyneynge oer the plaine a prieste was seen;<br/>Ne dighte full proude, ne buttoned up in golde;<br/>His cope and jape were graie, and eke were clene;<br/>A Limitoure he was of order seene;<br/>And from the pathwaie side then turned hee,<br/>Where the pore almer laie binethe the holmen tree.<br/><br/>"An almes, sir priest!" the droppynge pilgrim sayde,<br/>"For sweete Seyncte Marie and your order sake."<br/>The Limitoure then loosen'd his pouche threade,<br/>And did thereoute a groate of silver take;<br/>The mister pilgrim dyd for halline shake.<br/>"Here take this silver, it maie eathe thie care;<br/>We are Goddes stewards all, nete of oure owne we bare.<br/><br/>"But ah! unhailie pilgrim, lerne of me,<br/>Scathe anie give a rentrolle to their Lorde.<br/>Here take my semecope, thou arte bare I see;<br/>Tis thyne; the Seynctes will give me mie rewarde."<br/>He left the pilgrim, and his waie aborde.<br/>Virgynne and hallie Seyncte, who sitte yn gloure,<br/>Or give the mittee will, or give the gode man power.
