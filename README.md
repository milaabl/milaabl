# üíÆ Tiresias by *Algernon Charles Swinburne*

<p>
    PART I<br/><br/>It is an hour before the hour of dawn.<br/>Set in mine hand my staff and leave me here<br/>Outside the hollow house that blind men fear,<br/>More blind than I who live on life withdrawn<br/>And feel on eyes that see not but foresee<br/>The shadow of death which clothes Antigone.<br/><br/>Here lay her living body that here lies<br/>Dead, if man living know what thing is death,<br/>If life be all made up of blood and breath,<br/>And no sense be save as of ears and eyes.<br/>But heart there is not, tongue there is not found,<br/>To think or sing what verge hath life or bound.<br/><br/>In the beginning when the powers that made<br/>The young child man a little loved him, seeing<br/>His joy of life and fair face of his being,<br/>And bland and laughing with the man-child played,<br/>As friends they saw on our divine one day<br/>King Cadmus take to queen Harmonia.<br/><br/>The strength of soul that builds up as with hands<br/>Walls spiritual and towers and towns of thought<br/>Which only fate, not force, can bring to nought,<br/>Took then to wife the light of all men's lands,<br/>War's child and love's, most sweet and wise and strong,<br/>Order of things and rule and guiding song.<br/><br/>It was long since: yea, even the sun that saw<br/>Remembers hardly what was, nor how long.<br/>And now the wise heart of the worldly song<br/>Is perished, and the holy hand of law<br/>Can set no tune on time, nor help again<br/>The power of thought to build up life for men.<br/><br/>Yea, surely are they now transformed or dead,<br/>And sleep below this world, where no sun warms,<br/>Or move about it now in formless forms<br/>Incognizable, and all their lordship fled;<br/>And where they stood up singing crawl and hiss,<br/>With fangs that kill behind their lips that kiss.<br/><br/>Yet though her marriage-garment, seeming fair,<br/>Was dyed in sin and woven of jealousy<br/>To turn their seed to poison, time shall see<br/>The gods reissue from them, and repair<br/>Their broken stamp of godhead, and again<br/>Thought and wise love sing words of law to men.<br/><br/>I, Tiresias the prophet, seeing in Thebes<br/>Much evil, and the misery of men's hands<br/>Who sow with fruitless wheat the stones and sands,<br/>With fruitful thorns the fallows and warm glebes,<br/>Bade their hands hold lest worse hap came to pass;<br/>But which of you had heed of Tiresias?<br/><br/>I am as Time's self in mine own wearied mind,<br/>Whom the strong heavy-footed years have led<br/>From night to night and dead men unto dead,<br/>And from the blind hope to the memory blind;<br/>For each man's life is woven, as Time's life is,<br/>Of blind young hopes and old blind memories.<br/><br/>I am a soul outside of death and birth.<br/>I see before me and afterward I see,<br/>O child, O corpse, the live dead face of thee,<br/>Whose life and death are one thing upon earth<br/>Where day kills night and night again kills day<br/>And dies; but where is that Harmonia?<br/><br/>O all-beholden light not seen of me,<br/>Air, and warm winds that under the sun's eye<br/>Stretch your strong wings at morning; and thou, sky,<br/>Whose hollow circle engirdling earth and sea<br/>All night the set stars limit, and all day<br/>The moving sun remeasures; ye, I say,<br/><br/>Ye heights of hills, and thou Dircean spring<br/>Inviolable, and ye towers that saw cast down<br/>Seven kings keen-sighted toward your seven-faced town<br/>And quenched the red seed of one sightless king;<br/>And thou, for death less dreadful than for birth,<br/>Whose wild leaves hide the horror of the earth,<br/><br/>O mountain whereon gods made chase of kings,<br/>Cithaeron, thou that sawest on Pentheus dead<br/>Fangs of a mother fasten and wax red<br/>And satiate with a son thy swollen springs,<br/>And heardst her cry fright all thine eyries' nests<br/>Who gave death suck at sanguine-suckling breasts;<br/><br/>Yea, and a grief more grievous, without name,<br/>A curse too grievous for the name of grief,<br/>Thou sawest, and heardst the rumour scare belief<br/>Even unto death and madness, when the flame<br/>Was lit whose ashes dropped about the pyre<br/>That of two brethren made one sundering fire;<br/><br/>O bitter nurse, that on thine hard bare knees<br/>Rear'dst for his fate the bloody-footed child<br/>Whose hands should be more bloodily defiled<br/>And the old blind feet walk wearier ways than these,<br/>Whose seed, brought forth in darkness unto doom,<br/>Should break as fire out of his mother's womb;<br/><br/>I bear you witness as ye bear to me,<br/>Time, day, night, sun, stars, life, death, air, sea, earth,<br/>And ye that round the human house of birth<br/>Watch with veiled heads and weaponed hands, and see<br/>Good things and evil, strengthless yet and dumb,<br/>Sit in the clouds with cloudlike hours to come;<br/><br/>Ye forces without form and viewless powers<br/>That have the keys of all our years in hold,<br/>That prophesy too late with tongues of gold,<br/>In a strange speech whose words are perished hours,<br/>I witness to you what good things ye give<br/>As ye to me what evil while I live.<br/><br/>What should I do to blame you, what to praise,<br/>For floral hours and hours funereal?<br/>What should I do to curse or bless at all<br/>For winter-woven or summer-coloured days?<br/>Curse he that will and bless you whoso can,<br/>I have no common part in you with man.<br/><br/>I hear a springing water, whose quick sound<br/>Makes softer the soft sunless patient air,<br/>And the wind's hand is laid on my thin hair<br/>Light as a lover's, and the grasses round<br/>Have odours in them of green bloom and rain<br/>Sweet as the kiss wherewith sleep kisses pain.<br/><br/>I hear the low sound of the spring of time<br/>Still beating as the low live throb of blood,<br/>And where its waters gather head and flood<br/>I hear change moving on them, and the chime<br/>Across them of reverberate wings of hours<br/>Sounding, and feel the future air of flowers.<br/><br/>The wind of change is soft as snow, and sweet<br/>The sense thereof as roses in the sun,<br/>The faint wind springing with the springs that run,<br/>The dim sweet smell of flowering hopes, and heat<br/>Of unbeholden sunrise; yet how long<br/>I know not, till the morning put forth song.<br/><br/>I prophesy of life, who live with death;<br/>Of joy, being sad; of sunlight, who am blind;<br/>Of man, whose ways are alien from mankind<br/>And his lips are not parted with man's breath;<br/>I am a word out of the speechless years,<br/>The tongue of time, that no man sleeps who hears.<br/><br/>I stand a shadow across the door of doom,<br/>Athwart the lintel of death's house, and wait;<br/>Nor quick nor dead, nor flexible by fate,<br/>Nor quite of earth nor wholly of the tomb;<br/>A voice, a vision, light as fire or air,<br/>Driven between days that shall be and that were.<br/><br/>I prophesy, with feet upon a grave,<br/>Of death cast out and life devouring death<br/>As flame doth wood and stubble with a breath;<br/>Of freedom, though all manhood were one slave;<br/>Of truth, though all the world were liar; of love,<br/>That time nor hate can raze the witness of.<br/><br/>Life that was given for love's sake and his law's<br/>Their powers have no more power on; they divide<br/>Spoils wrung from lust or wrath of man or pride,<br/>And keen oblivion without pity or pause<br/>Sets them on fire and scatters them on air<br/>Like ashes shaken from a suppliant's hair.<br/><br/>But life they lay no hand on; life once given<br/>No force of theirs hath competence to take;<br/>Life that was given for some divine thing's sake,<br/>To mix the bitterness of earth with heaven,<br/>Light with man's night, and music with his breath,<br/>Dies not, but makes its living food of death.<br/><br/>I have seen this, who live where men are not,<br/>In the high starless air of fruitful night<br/>On that serenest and obscurest height<br/>Where dead and unborn things are one in thought<br/>And whence the live unconquerable springs<br/>Feed full of force the torrents of new things.<br/><br/>I have seen this, who saw long since, being man,<br/>As now I know not if indeed I be,<br/>The fair bare body of Wisdom, good to see<br/>And evil, whence my light and night began;<br/>Light on the goal and darkness on the way,<br/>Light all through night and darkness all through day.<br/><br/>Mother, that by that Pegasean spring<br/>Didst fold round in thine arms thy blinded son,<br/>Weeping "O holiest, what thing hast thou done,<br/>What, to my child? woe's me that see the thing!<br/>Is this thy love to me-ward, and hereof<br/>Must I take sample how the gods can love?<br/><br/>"O child, thou hast seen indeed, poor child of mine,<br/>The breasts and flanks of Pallas bare in sight,<br/>But never shalt see more the dear sun's light;<br/>O Helicon, how great a pay is thine<br/>For some poor antelopes and wild-deer dead,<br/>My child's eyes hast thou taken in their stead--"<br/><br/>Mother, thou knewest not what she had to give,<br/>Thy goddess, though then angered, for mine eyes;<br/>Fame and foreknowledge, and to be most wise,<br/>And centuries of high-thoughted life to live,<br/>And in mine hand this guiding staff to be<br/>As eyesight to the feet of men that see.<br/><br/>Perchance I shall not die at all, nor pass<br/>The general door and lintel of men dead;<br/>Yet even the very tongue of wisdom said<br/>What grace should come with death to Tiresias,<br/>What special honour that God's hand accord<br/>Who gathers all men's nations as their lord.<br/><br/>And sometimes when the secret eye of thought<br/>Is changed with obscuration, and the sense<br/>Aches with long pain of hollow prescience,<br/>And fiery foresight with foresuffering bought<br/>Seems even to infect my spirit and consume,<br/>Hunger and thirst come on me for the tomb.<br/><br/>I could be fain to drink my death and sleep,<br/>And no more wrapped about with bitter dreams<br/>Talk with the stars and with the winds and streams<br/>And with the inevitable years, and weep;<br/>For how should he who communes with the years<br/>Be sometime not a living spring of tears?<br/><br/>O child, that guided of thine only will<br/>Didst set thy maiden foot against the gate<br/>To strike it open ere thine hour of fate,<br/>Antigone, men say not thou didst ill,<br/>For love's sake and the reverence of his awe<br/>Divinely dying, slain by mortal law;<br/><br/>For love is awful as immortal death.<br/>And through thee surely hath thy brother won<br/>Rest, out of sight of our world-weary sun,<br/>And in the dead land where ye ghosts draw breath<br/>A royal place and honour; so wast thou<br/>Happy, though earth have hold of thee too now.<br/><br/>So hast thou life and name inviolable<br/>And joy it may be, sacred and severe,<br/>Joy secret-souled beyond all hope or fear,<br/>A monumental joy wherein to dwell<br/>Secluse and silent, a selected state,<br/>Serene possession of thy proper fate.<br/><br/>Thou art not dead as these are dead who live<br/>Full of blind years, a sorrow-shaken kind,<br/>Nor as these are am I the prophet blind;<br/>They have not life that have not heart to give<br/>Life, nor have eyesight who lack heart to see<br/>When to be not is better than to be.<br/><br/>O ye whom time but bears with for a span,<br/>How long will ye be blind and dead, how long<br/>Make your own souls part of your own soul's wrong?<br/>Son of the word of the most high gods, man,<br/>Why wilt thou make thine hour of light and breath<br/>Emptier of all but shame than very death?<br/><br/>Fool, wilt thou live for ever? though thou care<br/>With all thine heart for life to keep it fast,<br/>Shall not thine hand forego it at the last?<br/>Lo, thy sure hour shall take thee by the hair<br/>Sleeping, or when thou knowest not, or wouldst fly;<br/>And as men died much mightier shalt thou die.<br/><br/>Yea, they are dead, men much more worth than thou;<br/>The savour of heroic lives that were,<br/>Is it not mixed into thy common air?<br/>The sense of them is shed about thee now:<br/>Feel not thy brows a wind blowing from far?<br/>Aches not thy forehead with a future star?<br/><br/>The light that thou may'st make out of thy name<br/>Is in the wind of this same hour that drives,<br/>Blown within reach but once of all men's lives;<br/>And he that puts forth hand upon the flame<br/>Shall have it for a garland on his head<br/>To sign him for a king among the dead.<br/><br/>But these men that the lessening years behold,<br/>Who sit the most part without flame or crown,<br/>And brawl and sleep and wear their life-days down<br/>With joys and griefs ignobler than of old,<br/>And care not if the better day shall be -<br/>Are these or art thou dead, Antigone?<br/><br/>PART II<br/><br/>As when one wakes out of a waning dream<br/>And sees with instant eyes the naked thought<br/>Whereof the vision as a web was wrought,<br/>I saw beneath a heaven of cloud and gleam,<br/>Ere yet the heart of the young sun waxed brave,<br/>One like a prophet standing by a grave.<br/><br/>In the hoar heaven was hardly beam or breath,<br/>And all the coloured hills and fields were grey,<br/>And the wind wandered seeking for the day,<br/>And wailed as though he had found her done to death<br/>And this grey hour had built to bury her<br/>The hollow twilight for a sepulchre.<br/><br/>But in my soul I saw as in a glass<br/>A pale and living body full of grace<br/>There lying, and over it the prophet's face<br/>Fixed; and the face was not of Tiresias,<br/>For such a starry fire was in his eyes<br/>As though their light it was that made the skies.<br/><br/>Such eyes should God's have been when very love<br/>Looked forth of them and set the sun aflame,<br/>And such his lips that called the light by name<br/>And bade the morning forth at sound thereof;<br/>His face was sad and masterful as fate,<br/>And like a star's his look compassionate.<br/><br/>Like a star's gazed on of sad eyes so long<br/>It seems to yearn with pity, and all its fire<br/>As a man's heart to tremble with desire<br/>And heave as though the light would bring forth song;<br/>Yet from his face flashed lightning on the land,<br/>And like the thunder-bearer's was his hand.<br/><br/>The steepness of strange stairs had tired his feet,<br/>And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread<br/>Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed;<br/>But nothing was there in the world so sweet<br/>As the most bitter love, like God's own grace,<br/>Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face.<br/><br/>Grief and glad pride and passion and sharp shame,<br/>Wrath and remembrance, faith and hope and hate<br/>And pitiless pity of days degenerate,<br/>Were in his eyes as an incorporate flame<br/>That burned about her, and the heart thereof<br/>And central flower was very fire of love.<br/><br/>But all about her grave wherein she slept<br/>Were noises of the wild wind-footed years<br/>Whose footprints flying were full of blood and tears,<br/>Shrieks as of Maenads on their hills that leapt<br/>And yelled as beasts of ravin, and their meat<br/>Was the rent flesh of their own sons to eat:<br/><br/>And fiery shadows passing with strange cries,<br/>And Sphinx-like shapes about the ruined lands,<br/>And the red reek of parricidal hands<br/>And intermixture of incestuous eyes,<br/>And light as of that self-divided flame<br/>Which made an end of the Cadmean name.<br/><br/>And I beheld again, and lo the grave,<br/>And the bright body laid therein as dead,<br/>And the same shadow across another head<br/>That bowed down silent on that sleeping slave<br/>Who was the lady of empire from her birth<br/>And light of all the kingdoms of the earth.<br/><br/>Within the compass of the watcher's hand<br/>All strengths of other men and divers powers<br/>Were held at ease and gathered up as flowers;<br/>His heart was as the heart of his whole land,<br/>And at his feet as natural servants lay<br/>Twilight and dawn and night and labouring day.<br/><br/>He was most awful of the sons of God.<br/>Even now men seeing seemed at his lips to see<br/>The trumpet of the judgment that should be,<br/>And in his right hand terror for a rod,<br/>And in the breath that made the mountains bow<br/>The horned fire of Moses on his brow.<br/><br/>The strong wind of the coming of the Lord<br/>Had blown as flame upon him, and brought down<br/>On his bare head from heaven fire for a crown,<br/>And fire was girt upon him as a sword<br/>To smite and lighten, and on what ways he trod<br/>There fell from him the shadow of a God.<br/><br/>Pale, with the whole world's judgment in his eyes,<br/>He stood and saw the grief and shame endure<br/>That he, though highest of angels might not cure,<br/>And the same sins done under the same skies,<br/>And the same slaves to the same tyrants thrown,<br/>And fain he would have slept, and fain been stone.<br/><br/>But with unslumbering eyes he watched the sleep<br/>That sealed her sense whose eyes were suns of old;<br/>And the night shut and opened, and behold,<br/>The same grave where those prophets came to weep,<br/>But she that lay therein had moved and stirred,<br/>And where those twain had watched her stood a third.<br/><br/>The tripled rhyme that closed in Paradise<br/>With Love's name sealing up its starry speech -<br/>The tripled might of hand that found in reach<br/>All crowns beheld far off of all men's eyes,<br/>Song, colour, carven wonders of live stone -<br/>These were not, but the very soul alone.<br/><br/>The living spirit, the good gift of grace,<br/>The faith which takes of its own blood to give<br/>That the dead veins of buried hope may live,<br/>Came on her sleeping, face to naked face,<br/>And from a soul more sweet than all the south<br/>Breathed love upon her sealed and breathless mouth.<br/><br/>Between her lips the breath was blown as fire,<br/>And through her flushed veins leapt the liquid life,<br/>And with sore passion and ambiguous strife<br/>The new birth rent her and the new desire,<br/>The will to live, the competence to be,<br/>The sense to hearken and the soul to see.<br/><br/>And the third prophet standing by her grave<br/>Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her eyes<br/>Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise,<br/>And her soul caught from his the faith to save;<br/>Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born<br/>Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn.<br/><br/>For in the daybreak now that night was dead<br/>The light, the shadow, the delight, the pain,<br/>The purpose and the passion of those twain,<br/>Seemed gathered on that third prophetic head,<br/>And all their crowns were as one crown, and one<br/>His face with her face in the living sun.<br/><br/>For even with that communion of their eyes<br/>His whole soul passed into her and made her strong;<br/>And all the sounds and shows of shame and wrong,<br/>The hand that slays, the lip that mocks and lies,<br/>Temples and thrones that yet men seem to see -<br/>Are these dead or art thou dead, Italy?
