# 💮 Sonnet: I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true by *Rupert Brooke*

<p>
    I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.<br/>Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.<br/>On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --<br/>The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.<br/>Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.<br/>Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.<br/>But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,<br/>Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell<br/>Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:<br/>An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,<br/>Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;<br/>For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness.<br/>Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain. They doubt, and sigh,<br/>And do not love at all. Of these am I.
</p>
