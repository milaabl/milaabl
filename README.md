<!-- Start poem -->
# 💮 On the Beach at Night, Alone. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    ON the beach at night alone,<br/>As the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song,<br/>As I watch the bright stars shining—I think a thought of the clef of the universes, and of<br/>  the future.<br/><br/>A VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,<br/>All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets, comets, asteroids,<br/>All the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the same,<br/>All distances of place, however wide,<br/>All distances of time—all inanimate forms,<br/>All Souls—all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in different worlds,<br/>All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes—the fishes, the brutes,<br/>All men and women—me also;<br/>All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages;<br/>All identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any globe;<br/>All lives and deaths—all of the past, present, future;<br/>This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann’d, and shall forever span them, and<br/>  compactly hold them, and enclose them.
</p>

⭐ Star the [readme-mosaic](https://github.com/milaabl/readme-mosaic) repo for your 🐈‍⬛ avatar to be included in the next picture redrawing. The more users star the repo, the more realistic the picture will look like because the colors will get more diverse. It's a Python workflow. The author of the painting above is Arkhip Kuindzhi — a Ukrainian painter 💙💛.
