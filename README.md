# üíÆ Werner; or, the Inheritance by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    ACT I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_The Hall of a decayed Palace near a small<br/>       Town on the Northern Frontier of Silesia--the Night<br/>               tempestuous_.<br/><br/>               WERNER _and_ JOSEPHINE, _his Wife_.<br/><br/>_Jos._ My love, be calmer!<br/><br/>_Wer._                     I am calm.<br/><br/>_Jos._                               To me--<br/>Yes, but not to thyself: thy pace is hurried,<br/>And no one walks a chamber like to ours,<br/>With steps like thine, when his heart is at rest.<br/>Were it a garden, I should deem thee happy,<br/>And stepping with the bee from flower to flower;<br/>But _here!_<br/><br/>_Wer._      'Tis chill; the tapestry lets through<br/>The wind to which it waves: my blood is frozen.<br/><br/>_Jos._ Ah, no!<br/><br/>_Wer._ (_smiling_). Why! wouldst thou have it so?<br/><br/>_Jos._                                            I would<br/>Have it a healthful current.<br/><br/>_Wer._                        Let it flow<br/>Until 'tis spilt or checked--how soon, I care not.<br/><br/>_Jos._ And am I nothing in thy heart?<br/><br/>_Wer._                                All--all.<br/><br/>_Jos._ Then canst thou wish for that which must break mine?<br/><br/>_Wer._ (_approaching her slowly_).<br/>But for _thee_ I had been--no matter what--<br/>But much of good and evil; what I am,<br/>Thou knowest; what I might or should have been,<br/>Thou knowest not: but still I love thee, nor<br/>Shall aught divide us.<br/>           [WERNER _walks on abruptly, and then approaches_ JOSEPHINE.<br/>                      The storm of the night,<br/>Perhaps affects me; I'm a thing of feelings,<br/>And have of late been sickly, as, alas!<br/>Thou know'st by sufferings more than mine, my Love!<br/>In watching me.<br/><br/>_Jos._          To see thee well is much--<br/>To see thee happy----<br/><br/>_Wer._                Where hast thou seen such?<br/>Let me be wretched with the rest!<br/><br/>_Jos._                            But think<br/>How many in this hour of tempest shiver<br/>Beneath the biting wind and heavy rain,<br/>Whose every drop bows them down nearer earth,<br/>Which hath no chamber for them save beneath<br/>Her surface.<br/><br/>_Wer._        And that's not the worst: who cares<br/>For chambers? rest is all. The wretches whom<br/>Thou namest--aye, the wind howls round them, and<br/>The dull and dropping rain saps in their bones<br/>The creeping marrow. I have been a soldier,<br/>A hunter, and a traveller, and am<br/>A beggar, and should know the thing thou talk'st of.<br/><br/>_Jos._ And art thou not now sheltered from them all?<br/>_Wer._ Yes. And from these alone.<br/><br/>_Jos._                           And that is something.<br/><br/>_Wer._ True--to a peasant.<br/><br/>_Jos._                       Should the nobly born<br/>Be thankless for that refuge which their habits<br/>Of early delicacy render more<br/>Needful than to the peasant, when the ebb<br/>Of fortune leaves them on the shoals of life?<br/><br/>_Wer._ It is not that, thou know'st it is not: we<br/>Have borne all this, I'll not say patiently,<br/>Except in thee--but we have borne it.<br/><br/>_Jos._                                Well?<br/><br/>_Wer._ Something beyond our outward sufferings (though<br/>These were enough to gnaw into our souls)<br/>Hath stung me oft, and, more than ever, _now_.<br/>When, but for this untoward sickness, which<br/>Seized me upon this desolate frontier, and<br/>Hath wasted, not alone my strength, but means,<br/>And leaves us--no! this is beyond me!--but<br/>For this I had been happy--_thou_ been happy--<br/>The splendour of my rank sustained--my name--<br/>My father's name--been still upheld; and, more<br/>Than those----<br/><br/>_Jos._ (_abruptly_). My son--our son--our Ulric,<br/>Been clasped again in these long-empty arms,<br/>And all a mother's hunger satisfied.<br/>Twelve years! he was but eight then:--beautiful<br/>He was, and beautiful he must be now,<br/>My Ulric! my adored!<br/><br/>_Wer._               I have been full oft<br/>The chase of Fortune; now she hath o'ertaken<br/>My spirit where it cannot turn at bay,--<br/>Sick, poor, and lonely.<br/><br/>_Jos._                  Lonely! my dear husband?<br/><br/>_Wer._ Or worse--involving all I love, in this<br/>Far worse than solitude. _Alone_, I had died,<br/>And all been over in a nameless grave.<br/><br/>_Jos._ And I had not outlived thee; but pray take<br/>Comfort! We have struggled long; and they who strive<br/>With Fortune win or weary her at last,<br/>So that they find the goal or cease to feel<br/>Further. Take comfort,--we shall find our boy.<br/><br/>_Wer._ We were in sight of him, of every thing<br/>Which could bring compensation for past sorrow--<br/>And to be baffled thus!<br/><br/>_Jos._                  We are not baffled.<br/><br/>_Wer._ Are we not penniless?<br/><br/>_Jos._                       We ne'er were wealthy.<br/><br/>_Wer._ But I was born to wealth, and rank, and power;<br/>Enjoyed them, loved them, and, alas! abused them,<br/>And forfeited them by my father's wrath,<br/>In my o'er-fervent youth: but for the abuse<br/>Long-sufferings have atoned. My father's death<br/>Left the path open, yet not without snares.<br/>This cold and creeping kinsman, who so long<br/>Kept his eye on me, as the snake upon<br/>The fluttering bird, hath ere this time outstept me,<br/>Become the master of my rights, and lord<br/>Of that which lifts him up to princes in<br/>Dominion and domain.<br/><br/>_Jos._               Who knows? our son<br/>May have returned back to his grandsire, and<br/>Even now uphold thy rights for thee?<br/><br/>_Wer._                              'Tis hopeless.<br/>Since his strange disappearance from my father's,<br/>Entailing, as it were, my sins upon<br/>Himself, no tidings have revealed his course.<br/>I parted with him to his grandsire, on<br/>The promise that his anger would stop short<br/>Of the third generation; but Heaven seems<br/>To claim her stern prerogative, and visit<br/>Upon my boy his father's faults and follies.<br/><br/>_Jos._ I must hope better still,--at least we have yet<br/>Baffled the long pursuit of Stralenheim.<br/><br/>_Wer._ We should have done, but for this fatal sickness;--<br/>More fatal than a mortal malady,<br/>Because it takes not life, but life's sole solace:<br/>Even now I feel my spirit girt about<br/>By the snares of this avaricious fiend:--<br/>How do I know he hath not tracked us here?<br/><br/>_Jos._ He does not know thy person; and his spies,<br/>Who so long watched thee, have been left at Hamburgh.<br/>Our unexpected journey, and this change<br/>Of name, leaves all discovery far behind:<br/>None hold us here for aught save what we seem.<br/><br/>_Wer._ Save what we seem! save what we _are_--sick beggars,<br/>Even to our very hopes.--Ha! ha!<br/><br/>_Jos._                           Alas!<br/>That bitter laugh!<br/><br/>_Wer._            _Who_ would read in this form<br/>The high soul of the son of a long line?<br/>_Who_, in this garb, the heir of princely lands?<br/>_Who_, in this sunken, sickly eye, the pride<br/>Of rank and ancestry? In this worn cheek<br/>And famine-hollowed brow, the Lord of halls<br/>Which daily feast a thousand vassals?<br/><br/>_Jos._                                You<br/>Pondered not thus upon these worldly things,<br/>My Werner! when you deigned to choose for bride<br/>The foreign daughter of a wandering exile.<br/><br/>_Wer._ An exile's daughter with an outcast son,<br/>Were a fit marriage: but I still had hopes<br/>To lift thee to the state we both were born for.<br/>Your father's house was noble, though decayed;<br/>And worthy by its birth to match with ours.<br/><br/>_Jos._ Your father did not think so, though 'twas noble;<br/>But had my birth been all my claim to match<br/>With thee, I should have deemed it what it is.<br/><br/>_Wer._ And what is that in thine eyes?<br/><br/>_Jos._                                 All which it<br/>Has done in our behalf,--nothing.<br/><br/>_Wer._                            How,--nothing?<br/><br/>_Jos._ Or worse; for it has been a canker in<br/>Thy heart from the beginning: but for this,<br/>We had not felt our poverty but as<br/>Millions of myriads feel it--cheerfully;<br/>But for these phantoms of thy feudal fathers,<br/>Thou mightst have earned thy bread, as thousands earn it;<br/>Or, if that seem too humble, tried by commerce,<br/>Or other civic means, to amend thy fortunes.<br/><br/>_Wer._ (_ironically_). And been an Hanseatic burgher? Excellent!<br/><br/>_Jos._ Whate'er thou mightest have been, to me thou art<br/>What no state high or low can ever change,<br/>My heart's first choice;--which chose thee, knowing neither<br/>Thy birth, thy hopes, thy pride; nought, save thy sorrows:<br/>While they last, let me comfort or divide them:<br/>When they end--let mine end with them, or thee!<br/><br/>_Wer._ My better angel! Such I have ever found thee;<br/>This rashness, or this weakness of my temper,<br/>Ne'er raised a thought to injure thee or thine.<br/>Thou didst not mar my fortunes: my own nature<br/>In youth was such as to unmake an empire,<br/>Had such been my inheritance; but now,<br/>Chastened, subdued, out-worn, and taught to know<br/>Myself,--to lose this for our son and thee!<br/>Trust me, when, in my two-and-twentieth spring,<br/>My father barred me from my father's house,<br/>The last sole scion of a thousand sires<br/>(For I was then the last), it hurt me less<br/>Than to behold my boy and my boy's mother<br/>Excluded in their innocence from what<br/>My faults deserved-exclusion; although then<br/>My passions were all living serpents, and<br/>Twined like the Gorgon's round me.<br/>                                          [_A loud knocking is heard_.<br/><br/>_Jos._                             Hark!<br/><br/>_Wer._                                  A knocking!<br/><br/>_Jos._ Who can it be at this lone hour? We have<br/>Few visitors.<br/><br/>_Wer._        And poverty hath none,<br/>Save those who come to make it poorer still.<br/>Well--I am prepared.<br/><br/>                         [WERNER _puts his hand into his bosom, as if<br/>                            to search for some weapon_.<br/><br/>_Jos._               Oh! do not look so. I<br/>Will to the door. It cannot be of import<br/>In this lone spot of wintry desolation:--<br/>The very desert saves man from mankind.<br/>                                              [_She goes to the door_.<br/><br/>                        _Enter_ IDENSTEIN.<br/><br/>_Iden._ A fair good evening to my fair hostess<br/>And worthy----What's your name, my friend?<br/><br/>_Wer._                                   Are you<br/>Not afraid to demand it?<br/><br/>_Iden._                  Not afraid?<br/>Egad! I am afraid. You look as if<br/>I asked for something better than your name,<br/>By the face you put on it.<br/><br/>_Wer._                    Better, sir!<br/><br/>_Iden._ Better or worse, like matrimony: what<br/>Shall I say more? You have been a guest this month<br/>Here in the prince's palace--(to be sure,<br/>His Highness had resigned it to the ghosts<br/>And rats these twelve years--but 'tis still a palace)--<br/>I say you have been our lodger, and as yet<br/>We do not know your name.<br/><br/>_Wer._                    My name is Werner.<br/><br/>_Iden._ A goodly name, a very worthy name,<br/>As e'er was gilt upon a trader's board:<br/>I have a cousin in the lazaretto<br/>Of Hamburgh, who has got a wife who bore<br/>The same. He is an officer of trust,<br/>Surgeon's assistant (hoping to be surgeon),<br/>And has done miracles i' the way of business.<br/>Perhaps you are related to my relative?<br/><br/>_Wer._ To yours?<br/><br/>_Jos._           Oh, yes; we are, but distantly.<br/>(_Aside to_ WERNER.) Cannot you humour the dull gossip till<br/>We learn his purpose?<br/><br/>_Iden._               Well, I'm glad of that;<br/>I thought so all along, such natural yearnings<br/>Played round my heart:--blood is not water, cousin;<br/>And so let's have some wine, and drink unto<br/>Our better acquaintance: relatives should be<br/>Friends.<br/><br/>_Wer._ You appear to have drunk enough already;<br/>And if you have not, I've no wine to offer,<br/>Else it were yours: but this you know, or should know:<br/>You see I am poor, and sick, and will not see<br/>That I would be alone; but to your business!<br/>What brings you here?<br/><br/>_Iden._              Why, what should bring me here?<br/><br/>_Wer._ I know not, though I think that I could guess<br/>That which will send you hence.<br/><br/>_Jos._ (_aside_).               Patience, dear Werner!<br/><br/>_Iden._ You don't know what has happened, then?<br/><br/>_Jos._                                        How should we?<br/><br/>_Iden._ The river has o'erflowed.<br/><br/>_Jos._                            Alas! we have known<br/>That to our sorrow for these five days; since<br/>It keeps us here.<br/><br/>_Iden._           But what you don't know is,<br/>That a great personage, who fain would cross<br/>Against the stream and three postilions' wishes,<br/>Is drowned below the ford, with five post-horses,<br/>A monkey, and a mastiff--and a valet.<br/><br/>_Jos._ Poor creatures! are you sure?<br/><br/>_Iden._                              Yes, of the monkey,<br/>And the valet, and the cattle; but as yet<br/>We know not if his Excellency's dead<br/>Or no; your noblemen are hard to drown,<br/>As it is fit that men in office should be;<br/>But what is certain is, that he has swallowed<br/>Enough of the Oder to have burst two peasants;<br/>And now a Saxon and Hungarian traveller,<br/>Who, at their proper peril, snatched him from<br/>The whirling river, have sent on to crave<br/>A lodging, or a grave, according as<br/>It may turn out with the live or dead body.<br/><br/>_Jos._ And where will you receive him? here, I hope,<br/>If we can be of service--say the word.<br/><br/>_Iden._ Here? no; but in the Prince's own apartment,<br/>As fits a noble guest:--'tis damp, no doubt,<br/>Not having been inhabited these twelve years;<br/>But then he comes from a much damper place,<br/>So scarcely will catch cold in't, if he be<br/>Still liable to cold--and if not, why<br/>He'll be worse lodged to-morrow: ne'ertheless,<br/>I have ordered fire and all appliances<br/>To be got ready for the worst--that is,<br/>In case he should survive.<br/><br/>_Jos._                     Poor gentleman!<br/>I hope he will, with all my heart.<br/><br/>_Wer._                              Intendant,<br/>Have you not learned his name? (_Aside to his wife_.) My Josephine,<br/>Retire: I'll sift this fool.                        [_Exit_ JOSEPHINE.<br/><br/>_Iden._                      His name? oh Lord!<br/>Who knows if he hath now a name or no?<br/>'Tis time enough to ask it when he's able<br/>To give an answer; or if not, to put<br/>His heir's upon his epitaph. Methought<br/>Just now you chid me for demanding names?<br/><br/>_Wer._ True, true, I did so: you say well and wisely.<br/><br/>                       _Enter_ GABOR.<br/><br/>_Gab._ If I intrude, I crave----<br/><br/>_Iden._                          Oh, no intrusion!<br/>This is the palace; this a stranger like<br/>Yourself; I pray you make yourself at home:<br/>But where's his Excellency? and how fares he?<br/><br/>_Gab._ Wetly and wearily, but out of peril:<br/>He paused to change his garments in a cottage<br/>(Where I doffed mine for these, and came on hither),<br/>And has almost recovered from his drenching.<br/>He will be here anon.<br/><br/>_Iden._               What ho, there! bustle!<br/>Without there, Herman, Weilburg, Peter, Conrad!<br/>                  [_Gives directions to different servants who enter_.<br/>A nobleman sleeps here to-night--see that<br/>All is in order in the damask chamber--<br/>Keep up the stove--I will myself to the cellar--<br/>And Madame Idenstein (my consort, stranger,)<br/>Shall furnish forth the bed-apparel; for,<br/>To say the truth, they are marvellous scant of this<br/>Within the palace precincts, since his Highness<br/>Left it some dozen years ago. And then<br/>His Excellency will sup, doubtless?<br/><br/>_Gab._                              Faith!<br/>I cannot tell; but I should think the pillow<br/>Would please him better than the table, after<br/>His soaking in your river: but for fear<br/>Your viands should be thrown away, I mean<br/>To sup myself, and have a friend without<br/>Who will do honour to your good cheer with<br/>A traveller's appetite.<br/><br/>_Iden._                  But are you sure<br/>His Excellency----But his name: what is it?<br/><br/>_Gab._ I do not know.<br/><br/>_Iden._               And yet you saved his life.<br/><br/>_Gab._ I helped my friend to do so.<br/><br/>_Iden._                             Well, that's strange,<br/>To save a man's life whom you do not know.<br/><br/>_Gab._ Not so; for there are some I know so well,<br/>I scarce should give myself the trouble.<br/><br/>_Iden._                                 Pray,<br/>Good friend, and who may you be?<br/><br/>_Gab._                          By my family,<br/>Hungarian.<br/><br/>_Iden._    Which is called?<br/><br/>_Gab._                    It matters little.<br/><br/>_Iden._ (_aside_).

How? _We_, sir!<br/><br/>_Iden._                          No--not _you_,<br/>But some of the inferior knaves. You say<br/>The Baron was asleep in the great chair--<br/>The velvet chair--in his embroidered night-gown;<br/>His toilet spread before him, and upon it<br/>A cabinet with letters, papers, and<br/>Several rouleaux of gold; of which _one_ only<br/>Has disappeared:--the door unbolted, with<br/>No difficult access to any.<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                    Good sir,<br/>Be not so quick; the honour of the corps<br/>Which forms the Baron's household's unimpeached<br/>From steward to scullion, save in the fair way<br/>Of peculation; such as in accompts,<br/>Weights, measures, larder, cellar, buttery,<br/>Where all men take their prey; as also in<br/>Postage of letters, gathering of rents,<br/>Purveying feasts, and understanding with<br/>The honest trades who furnish noble masters;<br/>But for your petty, picking, downright thievery,<br/>We scorn it as we do board wages. Then<br/>Had one of our folks done it, he would not<br/>Have been so poor a spirit as to hazard<br/>His neck for _one_ rouleau, but have swooped all;<br/>Also the cabinet, if portable.<br/><br/>_Iden._ There is some sense in that----<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                                No, Sir, be sure<br/>'Twas none of our corps; but some petty, trivial<br/>Picker and stealer, without art or genius.<br/>The only question is--Who else could have<br/>Access, save the Hungarian and yourself?<br/><br/>_Iden._ You don't mean me?<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                   No, sir; I honour more<br/>Your talents----<br/><br/>_Iden._          And my principles, I hope.<br/><br/>_Fritz_. Of course. But to the point: What's to be done?<br/><br/>_Iden._ Nothing--but there's a good deal to be said.<br/>We'll offer a reward; move heaven and earth,<br/>And the police (though there's none nearer than<br/>Frankfort); post notices in manuscript<br/>(For we've no printer); and set by my clerk<br/>To read them (for few can, save he and I).<br/>We'll send out villains to strip beggars, and<br/>Search empty pockets; also, to arrest<br/>All gipsies, and ill-clothed and sallow people.<br/>Prisoners we'll have at least, if not the culprit;<br/>And for the Baron's gold--if 'tis not found,<br/>At least he shall have the full satisfaction<br/>Of melting twice its substance in the raising<br/>The ghost of this rouleau. Here's alchemy<br/>For your Lord's losses!<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                He hath found a better.<br/><br/>_Iden._ _Where?_<br/><br/>_Fritz_.         In a most immense inheritance.<br/>The late Count Siegendorf, his distant kinsman,<br/>Is dead near Prague, in his castle, and my Lord<br/>Is on his way to take possession.<br/><br/>_Iden._                           Was there<br/>No heir?<br/><br/>_Fritz_. Oh, yes; but he has disappeared<br/>Long from the world's eye, and, perhaps, the world.<br/>A prodigal son, beneath his father's ban<br/>For the last twenty years; for whom his sire<br/>Refused to kill the fatted calf; and, therefore,<br/>If living, he must chew the husks still. But<br/>The Baron would find means to silence him,<br/>Were he to re-appear: he's politic,<br/>And has much influence with a certain court.<br/><br/>_Iden._ He's fortunate.<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                'Tis true, there is a grandson,<br/>Whom the late Count reclaimed from his son's hands,<br/>And educated as his heir; but, then,<br/>His birth is doubtful.<br/><br/>_Iden._                How so?<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                      His sire made<br/>A left-hand, love, imprudent sort of marriage,<br/>With an Italian exile's dark-eyed daughter:<br/>Noble, they say, too; but no match for such<br/>A house as Siegendorf's. The grandsire ill<br/>Could brook the alliance; and could ne'er be brought<br/>To see the parents, though he took the son.<br/><br/>_Iden._ If he's a lad of mettle, he may yet<br/>Dispute your claim, and weave a web that may<br/>Puzzle your Baron to unravel.<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                      Why,<br/>For mettle, he has quite enough: they say,<br/>He forms a happy mixture of his sire<br/>And grandsire's qualities,--impetuous as<br/>The former, and deep as the latter; but<br/>The strangest is, that he too disappeared<br/>Some months ago.<br/><br/>_Iden._          The devil he did!<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                          Why, yes:<br/>It must have been at _his_ suggestion, at<br/>An hour so critical as was the eve<br/>Of the old man's death, whose heart was broken by it.<br/><br/>_Iden._ Was there no cause assigned?<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                             Plenty, no doubt,<br/>And none, perhaps, the true one. Some averred<br/>It was to seek his parents; some because<br/>The old man held his spirit in so strictly<br/>(But that could scarce be, for he doted on him);<br/>A third believed he wished to serve in war,<br/>But, peace being made soon after his departure,<br/>He might have since returned, were that the motive;<br/>A fourth set charitably have surmised,<br/>As there was something strange and mystic in him,<br/>That in the wild exuberance of his nature<br/>He had joined the black bands, who lay waste Lusatia,<br/>The mountains of Bohemia and Silesia,<br/>Since the last years of war had dwindled into<br/>A kind of general condottiero system<br/>Of bandit-warfare; each troop with its chief,<br/>And all against mankind.<br/><br/>_Iden._                 That cannot be.<br/>A young heir, bred to wealth and luxury,<br/>To risk his life and honours with disbanded<br/>Soldiers and desperadoes!<br/><br/>_Fritz_.                  Heaven best knows!<br/>But there are human natures so allied<br/>Unto the savage love of enterprise,<br/>That they will seek for peril as a pleasure.<br/>I've heard that nothing can reclaim your Indian,<br/>Or tame the tiger, though their infancy<br/>Were fed on milk and honey. After all,<br/>Your Wallenstein, your Tilly and Gustavus,<br/>Your Bannier, and your Torstenson and Weimar,<br/>Were but the same thing upon a grand scale;<br/>And now that they are gone, and peace proclaimed,<br/>They who would follow the same pastime must<br/>Pursue it on their own account. Here comes<br/>The Baron, and the Saxon stranger, who<br/>Was his chief aid in yesterday's escape,<br/>But did not leave the cottage by the Oder<br/>Until this morning.<br/><br/>                 _Enter_ STRALENHEIM _and_ ULRIC.<br/><br/>_Stral._            Since you have refused<br/>All compensation, gentle stranger, save<br/>Inadequate thanks, you almost check even them,<br/>Making me feel the worthlessness of words,<br/>And blush at my own barren gratitude,<br/>They seem so niggardly, compared with what<br/>Your courteous courage did in my behalf----<br/><br/>_Ulr._ I pray you press the theme no further.<br/><br/>_Stral._                                      But<br/>Can I not serve you? You are young, and of<br/>That mould which throws out heroes; fair in favour;<br/>Brave, I know, by my living now to say so;<br/>And, doubtlessly, with such a form and heart,<br/>Would look into the fiery eyes of War,<br/>As ardently for glory as you dared<br/>An obscure death to save an unknown stranger,<br/>In an as perilous, but opposite, element.<br/>You are made for the service: I have served;<br/>Have rank by birth and soldiership, and friends,<br/>Who shall be yours. 'Tis true this pause of peace<br/>Favours such views at present scantily;<br/>But 'twill not last, men's spirits are too stirring;<br/>And, after thirty years of conflict, peace<br/>Is but a petty war, as the time shows us<br/>In every forest, or a mere armed truce.<br/>War will reclaim his own; and, in the meantime,<br/>You might obtain a post, which would ensure<br/>A higher soon, and, by my influence, fail not<br/>To rise. I speak of Brandenburgh, wherein<br/>I stand well with the Elector; in Bohemia,<br/>Like you, I am a stranger, and we are now<br/>Upon its frontier.<br/><br/>_Ulr._             You perceive my garb<br/>Is Saxon, and, of course, my service due<br/>To my own Sovereign. If I must decline<br/>Your offer, 'tis with the same feeling which<br/>Induced it.<br/><br/>_Stral._    Why, this is mere usury!<br/>I owe my life to you, and you refuse<br/>The acquittance of the interest of the debt,<br/>To heap more obligations on me, till<br/>I bow beneath them.<br/><br/>_Ulr._              You shall say so when<br/>I claim the payment.<br/><br/>_Stral._             Well, sir, since you will not--<br/>You are nobly born?<br/><br/>_Ulr._              I have heard my kinsmen say so.<br/><br/>_Stral._ Your actions show it.

The boy, they say, 's a bold one;<br/>But he hath played the truant in some hour<br/>Of freakish folly, leaving fortune to<br/>Champion his claims. That's well. The father, whom<br/>For years I've tracked, as does the blood-hound, never<br/>In sight, but constantly in scent, had put me<br/>To fault; but _here_ I _have_ him, and that's better.<br/>It must be _he_! All circumstance proclaims it;<br/>And careless voices, knowing not the cause<br/>Of my enquiries, still confirm it.--Yes!<br/>The man, his bearing, and the mystery<br/>Of his arrival, and the time; the account, too,<br/>The Intendant gave (for I have not beheld her)<br/>Of his wife's dignified but foreign aspect;<br/>Besides the antipathy with which we met,<br/>As snakes and lions shrink back from each other<br/>By secret instinct that both must be foes<br/>Deadly, without being natural prey to either;<br/>All--all--confirm it to my mind. However,<br/>We'll grapple, ne'ertheless. In a few hours<br/>The order comes from Frankfort, if these waters<br/>Rise not the higher (and the weather favours<br/>Their quick abatement), and I'll have him safe<br/>Within a dungeon, where he may avouch<br/>His real estate and name; and there's no harm done,<br/>Should he prove other than I deem. This robbery<br/>(Save for the actual loss) is lucky also;<br/>He's poor, and that's suspicious--he's unknown,<br/>And that's defenceless.--True, we have no proofs<br/>Of guilt--but what hath he of innocence?<br/>Were he a man indifferent to my prospects,<br/>In other bearings, I should rather lay<br/>The inculpation on the Hungarian, who<br/>Hath something which I like not; and alone<br/>Of all around, except the Intendant, and<br/>The Prince's household and my own, had ingress<br/>Familiar to the chamber.<br/><br/>                          _Enter_ GABOR.<br/><br/>                        Friend, how fare you?<br/><br/>_Gab._ As those who fare well everywhere, when they<br/>Have supped and slumbered, no great matter how--<br/>And you, my Lord?<br/><br/>_Stral._          Better in rest than purse:<br/>Mine inn is like to cost me dear.<br/><br/>_Gab._                           I heard<br/>Of your late loss; but 'tis a trifle to<br/>One of your order.<br/><br/>_Stral._           You would hardly think so,<br/>Were the loss yours.<br/><br/>_Gab._               I never had so much<br/>(At once) in my whole life, and therefore am not<br/>Fit to decide. But I came here to seek you.<br/>Your couriers are turned back--I have outstripped them,<br/>In my return.<br/><br/>_Stral._      You!--Why?<br/><br/>_Gab._                  I went at daybreak,<br/>To watch for the abatement of the river,<br/>As being anxious to resume my journey.<br/>Your messengers were all checked like myself;<br/>And, seeing the case hopeless, I await<br/>The current's pleasure.<br/><br/>_Stral._                Would the dogs were in it!<br/>Why did they not, at least, attempt the passage?<br/>I ordered this at all risks.<br/><br/>_Gab._                       Could you order<br/>The Oder to divide, as Moses did<br/>The Red Sea (scarcely redder than the flood<br/>Of the swoln stream), and be obeyed, perhaps<br/>They might have ventured.<br/><br/>_Stral._                 I must see to it:<br/>The knaves! the slaves!--but they shall smart for this.<br/>                                                  [_Exit_ STRALENHEIM.<br/><br/>_Gab._ (_solus_).

But to change<br/>The topic----<br/><br/>_Wer._        You mean to _pursue_ it, as<br/>'Tis of our safety.<br/><br/>_Ulr._              Right; I stand corrected.<br/>I see the subject now more clearly, and<br/>Our general situation in its bearings.<br/>The waters are abating; a few hours<br/>Will bring his summoned myrmidons from Frankfort,<br/>When you will be a prisoner, perhaps worse,<br/>And I an outcast, bastardised by practice<br/>Of this same Baron to make way for him.<br/><br/>_Wer._ And now your remedy!

[_He gives_ WERNER _a jewel_.<br/><br/>_Wer._     A gem! It was my father's!<br/><br/>_Ulr._                               And<br/>As such is now your own.

Once beyond<br/>The frontier, and you're safe.<br/><br/>_Wer._                         My noble boy!<br/><br/>_Ulr._ Hush! hush! no transports: we'll indulge in them<br/>In Castle Siegendorf! Display no gold:<br/>Show Idenstein the gem (I know the man,<br/>And have looked through him): it will answer thus<br/>A double purpose. Stralenheim lost _gold_--<br/>_No_ jewel: therefore it could _not_ be his;<br/>And then the man who was possest of this<br/>Can hardly be suspected of abstracting<br/>The Baron's coin, when he could thus convert<br/>This ring to more than Stralenheim has lost<br/>By his last night's slumber.

Your error has redoubled all<br/>The present difficulties of our house<br/>At secret war with that of Stralenheim:<br/>All we have now to think of is to baffle<br/>HIM. I have shown _one_ way.<br/><br/>_Wer._                      The only one,<br/>And I embrace it, as I did my son,<br/>Who showed _himself_ and father's _safety_ in<br/>One day.<br/><br/>_Ulr._   You _shall_ be safe; let that suffice.<br/>Would Stralenheim's appearance in Bohemia<br/>Disturb your right, or mine, if once we were<br/>Admitted to our lands?<br/><br/>_Wer._                  Assuredly,<br/>Situate as we are now; although the first<br/>Possessor might, as usual, prove the strongest--<br/>Especially the next in blood.<br/><br/>_Ulr._                        _Blood_!

And was he one?<br/><br/>_Ulr._ I've heard so; but I must take leave.

Four--<br/>Five--six hours have I counted, like the guard<br/>Of outposts, on the never-merry clock,<br/>That hollow tongue of time, which, even when<br/>It sounds for joy, takes something from enjoyment<br/>With every clang. 'Tis a perpetual knell,<br/>Though for a marriage-feast it rings: each stroke<br/>Peals for a hope the less; the funeral note<br/>Of Love deep-buried, without resurrection,<br/>In the grave of Possession; while the knoll<br/>Of long-lived parents finds a jovial echo<br/>To triple time in the son's ear.<br/>                                 I'm cold--<br/>I'm dark;--I've blown my fingers--numbered o'er<br/>And o'er my steps--and knocked my head against<br/>Some fifty buttresses--and roused the rats<br/>And bats in general insurrection, till<br/>Their curs√©d pattering feet and whirling wings<br/>Leave me scarce hearing for another sound.<br/>A light!

Here is a darksome angle--so,<br/>That's weathered.--Let me pause.--Suppose it leads<br/>Into some greater danger than that which<br/>I have escaped--no matter, 'tis a new one;<br/>And novel perils, like fresh mistresses,<br/>Wear more magnetic aspects:--I will on,<br/>And be it where it may--I have my dagger<br/>Which may protect me at a pinch.--Burn still,<br/>Thou little light!

I must find<br/>Some means of restitution, which would ease<br/>My soul in part: but how, without discovery?--<br/>It must be done, however; and I'll pause<br/>Upon the method the first hour of safety.<br/>The madness of my misery led to this<br/>Base infamy; repentance must retrieve it:<br/>I will have nought of Stralenheim's upon<br/>My spirit, though he would grasp all of mine;<br/>Lands, freedom, life,--and yet he sleeps as soundly<br/>Perhaps, as infancy, with gorgeous curtains<br/>Spread for his canopy, o'er silken pillows,<br/>Such as when----Hark! what noise is that?

Why<br/>For the mere cup and trencher, we no doubt<br/>Fared passing well; but as for merriment<br/>And sport, without which salt and sauces season<br/>The cheer but scantily, our sizings were<br/>Even of the narrowest.<br/><br/>_Hen._                 The old count loved not<br/>The roar of revel; are you sure that _this_ does?<br/><br/>_Eric_. As yet he hath been courteous as he's bounteous,<br/>And we all love him.<br/><br/>_Hen._               His reign is as yet<br/>Hardly a year o'erpast its honeymoon,<br/>And the first year of sovereigns is bridal:<br/>Anon, we shall perceive his real sway<br/>And moods of mind.<br/><br/>_Eric_.            Pray Heaven he keep the present!<br/>Then his brave son, Count Ulric--there's a knight!<br/>Pity the wars are o'er!<br/><br/>_Hen._                  Why so?<br/><br/>_Eric_.                        Look on him!<br/>And answer that yourself.<br/><br/>_Hen._                    He's very youthful,<br/>And strong and beautiful as a young tiger.<br/><br/>_Eric_. That's not a faithful vassal's likeness.<br/><br/>_Hen._                                           But<br/>Perhaps a true one.<br/><br/>_Eric_.              Pity, as I said,<br/>The wars are over: in the hall, who like<br/>Count Ulric for a well-supported pride,<br/>Which awes, but yet offends not? in the field,<br/>Who like him with his spear in hand, when gnashing<br/>His tusks, and ripping up, from right to left,<br/>The howling hounds, the boar makes for the thicket?<br/>Who backs a horse, or bears a hawk, or wears<br/>A sword like him? Whose plume nods knightlier?<br/><br/>_Hen._ No one's, I grant you. Do not fear, if war<br/>Be long in coming, he is of that kind<br/>Will make it for himself, if he hath not<br/>Already done as much.<br/><br/>_Eric_.

Rest!<br/>But what beyond 'tis not ours to pronounce.<br/><br/>_Hen._ I wish they had left us something of their rest:<br/>The country (nominally now at peace)<br/>Is over-run with--God knows who: they fly<br/>By night, and disappear with sunrise; but<br/>Leave us no less desolation, nay, even more,<br/>Than the most open warfare.<br/><br/>_Eric_.                    But Count Ulric--<br/>What has all this to do with him?<br/><br/>_Hen._                            With him!<br/>He----might prevent it. As you say he's fond<br/>Of war, why makes he it not on those marauders?<br/><br/>_Eric_. You'd better ask himself.<br/><br/>_Hen._                            I would as soon<br/>Ask the lion why he laps not milk.<br/><br/>_Eric_. And here he comes!<br/><br/>_Hen._                    The devil! you'll hold your tongue?<br/><br/>_Eric_. Why do you turn so pale?<br/><br/>_Hen._                          'Tis nothing--but<br/>Be silent.<br/><br/>_Eric_.    I will, upon what you have said.<br/><br/>_Hen._ I assure you I meant nothing,--a mere sport<br/>Of words, no more; besides, had it been otherwise,<br/>He is to espouse the gentle Baroness<br/>Ida of Stralenheim, the late Baron's heiress;<br/>And she, no doubt, will soften whatsoever<br/>Of fierceness the late long intestine wars<br/>Have given all natures, and most unto those<br/>Who were born in them, and bred up upon<br/>The knees of Homicide; sprinkled, as it were,<br/>With blood even at their baptism.

But mine survives<br/>The wound.<br/><br/>_Ulr._     You err. My nature is not given<br/>To outward fondling: how should it be so,<br/>After twelve years' divorcement from my parents?<br/><br/>_Sieg._ And did not _I_ too pass those twelve torn years<br/>In a like absence? But 'tis vain to urge you--<br/>Nature was never called back by remonstrance.<br/>Let's change the theme.

I would not have her<br/>Break her heart with a man who has none to break!<br/>Or wither on her stalk like some pale rose<br/>Deserted by the bird she thought a nightingale,<br/>According to the Orient tale.

Is there no blood upon it?<br/><br/>_Sieg._ No; but there's worse than blood--eternal shame!<br/><br/>_Prior_.

I have spoken<br/>The truth, and nought but truth, if _not_ the _whole_;<br/>Yet say I am _not_ guilty! for the blood<br/>Of this man weighs on me, as if I shed it,<br/>Though, by the Power who abhorreth human blood,<br/>I did not!--nay, once spared it, when I might<br/>And _could_--aye, perhaps, _should_ (if our self-safety<br/>Be e'er excusable in such defences<br/>Against the attacks of over-potent foes):<br/>But pray for him, for me, and all my house;<br/>For, as I said, though I be innocent,<br/>I know not why, a like remorse is on me,<br/>As if he had fallen by me or mine. Pray for me,<br/>Father! I have prayed myself in vain.<br/><br/>_Prior_.                              I will.<br/>Be comforted!

But it will be so,<br/>When the mind gathers up its truth within it.<br/>Remember the great festival to-morrow,<br/>In which you rank amidst our chiefest nobles,<br/>As well as your brave son; and smooth your aspect,<br/>Nor in the general orison of thanks<br/>For bloodshed stopt, let blood you shed not rise,<br/>A cloud, upon your thoughts.

The flowers, the boughs,<br/>The banners, and the nobles, and the knights,<br/>The gems, the robes, the plumes, the happy faces,<br/>The coursers, and the incense, and the sun<br/>Streaming through the stained windows, even the _tombs_,<br/>Which looked so calm, and the celestial hymns,<br/>Which seemed as if they rather came from Heaven<br/>Than mounted there--the bursting organ's peal<br/>Rolling on high like an harmonious thunder;<br/>The white robes and the lifted eyes; the world<br/>At peace! and all at peace with one another!<br/>Oh, my sweet mother!

There's, for instance,<br/>The young Count Waldorf, who scarce once withdrew<br/>His eyes from yours to-day.<br/><br/>_Ida._                      I did not see him,<br/>But Ulric.

I grew<br/>Sick; and when I recovered from the mist<br/>Which curled about my senses, and again<br/>Looked down, I saw him not.

A martial force,<br/>Sent by the state, had, after strong resistance,<br/>Secured a band of desperate men, supposed<br/>Marauders from the hostile camp.--They proved,<br/>However, not to be so--but banditti,<br/>Whom either accident or enterprise<br/>Had carried from their usual haunt--the forests<br/>Which skirt Bohemia--even into Lusatia.<br/>Many amongst them were reported of<br/>High rank--and martial law slept for a time.<br/>At last they were escorted o'er the frontiers,<br/>And placed beneath the civil jurisdiction<br/>Of the free town of Frankfort. Of _their_ fate<br/>I know no more.<br/><br/>_Sieg._         And what is this to Ulric?<br/><br/>_Gab._ Amongst them there was said to be one man<br/>Of wonderful endowments:--birth and fortune,<br/>Youth, strength, and beauty, almost superhuman,<br/>And courage as unrivalled, were proclaimed<br/>His by the public rumour; and his sway,<br/>Not only over his associates, but<br/>His judges, was attributed to witchcraft,<br/>Such was his influence:--I have no great faith<br/>In any magic save that of the mine--<br/>I therefore deemed him wealthy.--But my soul<br/>Was roused with various feelings to seek out<br/>This prodigy, if only to behold him.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ And did you so?<br/><br/>_Gab._                  You'll hear. Chance favoured me:<br/>A popular affray in the public square<br/>Drew crowds together--it was one of those<br/>Occasions where men's souls look out of them,<br/>And show them as they are--even in their faces:<br/>The moment my eye met his, I exclaimed,<br/>"This is the man!" though he was then, as since,<br/>With the nobles of the city. I felt sure<br/>I had not erred, and watched him long and nearly;<br/>I noted down his form--his gesture--features,<br/>Stature, and bearing--and amidst them all,<br/>'Midst every natural and acquired distinction,<br/>I could discern, methought, the assassin's eye<br/>And gladiator's heart.<br/><br/>_Ulr._ (_smiling_). The tale sounds well.<br/><br/>_Gab._ And may sound better.--He appeared to me<br/>One of those beings to whom Fortune bends,<br/>As she doth to the daring--and on whom<br/>The fates of others oft depend; besides,<br/>An indescribable sensation drew me<br/>Near to this man, as if my point of fortune<br/>Was to be fixed by him.--There I was wrong.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ And may not be right now.<br/><br/>_Gab._                            I followed him,<br/>Solicited his notice--and obtained it--<br/>Though not his friendship:--it was his intention<br/>To leave the city privately--we left it<br/>Together--and together we arrived<br/>In the poor town where Werner was concealed,<br/>And Stralenheim was succoured----Now we are on<br/>The verge--_dare_ you hear further?<br/><br/>_Sieg._                             I must do so--<br/>Or I have heard too much.<br/><br/>_Gab._                   I saw in you<br/>A man above his station--and if not<br/>So high, as now I find you, in my then<br/>Conceptions, 'twas that I had rarely seen<br/>Men such as you appeared in height of mind,<br/>In the most high of worldly rank; you were<br/>Poor, even to all save rags: I would have shared<br/>My purse, though slender, with you--you refused it.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ Doth my refusal make a debt to you,<br/>That thus you urge it?<br/><br/>_Gab._                 Still you owe me something,<br/>Though not for that; and I owed you my safety,<br/>At least my seeming safety, when the slaves<br/>Of Stralenheim pursued me on the grounds<br/>That _I_ had robbed him.<br/><br/>_Sieg._                  _I_ concealed you--I,<br/>Whom and whose house you arraign, reviving viper!<br/><br/>_Gab._ I accuse no man--save in my defence.<br/>You, Count, have made yourself accuser--judge:<br/>Your hall's my court, your heart is my tribunal.<br/>Be just, and _I'll_ be merciful!<br/><br/>_Sieg._                          You merciful?--<br/>You!

God of fathers!<br/><br/>_Gab._                      I beheld his features<br/>As I see yours--but yours they were not, though<br/>Resembling them--behold them in Count Ulric's!<br/>Distinct as I beheld them, though the expression<br/>Is not now what it then was!--but it was so<br/>When I first charged him with the crime--so lately.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ This is so--<br/><br/>_Gab._ (_interrupting him_). Nay--but hear me to the end!<br/>_Now_ you must do so.--I conceived myself<br/>Betrayed by you and _him_ (for now I saw<br/>There was some tie between you) into this<br/>Pretended den of refuge, to become<br/>The victim of your guilt; and my first thought<br/>Was vengeance: but though armed with a short poniard<br/>(Having left my sword without), I was no match<br/>For him at any time, as had been proved<br/>That morning--either in address or force.<br/>I turned and fled--i' the dark: chance rather than<br/>Skill made me gain the secret door of the hall,<br/>And thence the chamber where you slept: if I<br/>Had found you _waking_, Heaven alone can tell<br/>What vengeance and suspicion might have prompted;<br/>But ne'er slept guilt as Werner slept that night.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ And yet I had horrid dreams! and such brief sleep,<br/>The stars had not gone down when I awoke.<br/>Why didst thou spare me? I dreamt of my father--<br/>And now my dream is out!<br/><br/>_Gab._                  'Tis not my fault,<br/>If I have read it.--Well!

Indeed!<br/><br/>_Gab._ Is it revenge or justice which inspires<br/>Your meditation?<br/><br/>_Sieg._         Neither--I was weighing<br/>The value of your secret.<br/><br/>_Gab._                    You shall know it<br/>At once:--When you were poor, and I, though poor,<br/>Rich enough to relieve such poverty<br/>As might have envied mine, I offered you<br/>My purse--you would not share it:--I'll be franker<br/>With you: you are wealthy, noble, trusted by<br/>The imperial powers--you understand me?<br/><br/>_Sieg._                                 Yes.<br/><br/>_Gab._ Not quite. You think me venal, and scarce true:<br/>'Tis no less true, however, that my fortunes<br/>Have made me both at present. You shall aid me:<br/>I would have aided you--and also have<br/>Been somewhat damaged in my name to save<br/>Yours and your son's. Weigh well what I have said.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ Dare you await the event of a few minutes'<br/>Deliberation?<br/><br/>_Gab._ (_casts his eyes on_ ULRIC, _who is<br/>leaning against a pillar_).   If I should do so?<br/><br/>_Sieg._ I pledge my life for yours. Withdraw into<br/>This tower.                                    [_Opens a turret-door_.<br/><br/>_Gab._ (_hesitatingly_). This is the second _safe_ asylum<br/>You have offered me.<br/><br/>_Sieg._             And was not the first so?<br/><br/>_Gab._ I know not that even now--but will approve<br/>The second. I have still a further shield.--<br/>I did not enter Prague alone; and should I<br/>Be put to rest with Stralenheim, there are<br/>Some tongues without will wag in my behalf.<br/>Be brief in your decision!<br/><br/>_Sieg._                   I will be so.--<br/>My word is sacred and irrevocable<br/>Within _these_ walls, but it extends no further.<br/><br/>_Gab._ I'll take it for so much.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ (_points to_ ULRIC'S _sabre, still upon the ground_).<br/>                               Take also _that_--<br/>I saw you eye it eagerly, and him<br/>Distrustfully.<br/><br/>_Gab._ (_takes up the sabre_). I will; and so provide<br/>To sell my life--not cheaply.<br/>             [GABOR _goes into the turret, which_ SIEGENDORF _closes_.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ (_advances to_ ULRIC). Now, Count Ulric!<br/>For son I dare not call thee--What say'st thou?<br/><br/>_Ulr._ His tale is true.<br/><br/>_Sieg._                  True, monster!<br/><br/>_Ulr._                                 Most true, father!<br/>And you did well to listen to it: what<br/>We know, we can provide against. He must<br/>Be silenced.<br/><br/>_Sieg._      Aye, with half of my domains;<br/>And with the other half, could he and thou<br/>Unsay this villany.<br/><br/>_Ulr._             It is no time<br/>For trifling or dissembling. I have said<br/>His story's true; and he too must be silenced.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ How so?<br/><br/>_Ulr._          As Stralenheim is. Are you so dull<br/>As never to have hit on this before?<br/>When we met in the garden, what except<br/>Discovery in the act could make me know<br/>His death? Or had the Prince's household been<br/>Then summoned, would the cry for the police<br/>Been left to such a stranger? Or should I<br/>Have loitered on the way? Or could _you, Werner_,<br/>The object of the Baron's hate and fears,<br/>Have fled, unless by many an hour before<br/>Suspicion woke? I sought and fathomed you,<br/>Doubting if you were false or feeble: I<br/>Perceived you were the latter: and yet so<br/>Confiding have I found you, that I doubted<br/>At times your weakness.<br/><br/>_Sieg._                 Parricide! no less<br/>Than common stabber! What deed of my life,<br/>Or thought of mine, could make you deem me fit<br/>For your accomplice?<br/><br/>_Ulr._               Father, do not raise<br/>The devil you cannot lay between us. This<br/>Is time for union and for action, not<br/>For family disputes. While _you_ were tortured,<br/>Could _I_ be calm? Think you that I have heard<br/>This fellow's tale without some feeling?--You<br/>Have taught me feeling for _you_ and myself;<br/>For whom or what else did you ever teach it?<br/><br/>_Sieg._ Oh! my dead father's curse! 'tis working now.<br/><br/>_Ulr._ Let it work on! the grave will keep it down!<br/>Ashes are feeble foes: it is more easy<br/>To baffle such, than countermine a mole,<br/>Which winds its blind but living path beneath you.<br/>Yet hear me still!--If _you_ condemn me, yet,<br/>Remember _who_ hath taught me once too often<br/>To listen to him! _Who_ proclaimed to me<br/>That _there were crimes_ made venial by the occasion?<br/>That passion was our nature? that the goods<br/>Of Heaven waited on the goods of fortune?<br/>_Who_ showed me his humanity secured<br/>By his _nerves_ only? _Who_ deprived me of<br/>All power to vindicate myself and race<br/>In open day? By his disgrace which stamped<br/>(It might be) bastardy on me, and on<br/>Himself--a _felon's_ brand! The man who is<br/>At once both warm and weak invites to deeds<br/>He longs to do, but dare not. Is it strange<br/>That I should _act_ what you could _think?_ We have done<br/>With right and wrong; and now must only ponder<br/>Upon effects, not causes. Stralenheim,<br/>Whose life I saved from impulse, as _unknown_,<br/>I would have saved a peasant's or a dog's, I slew<br/>_Known_ as our foe--but not from vengeance. He<br/>Was a rock in our way which I cut through,<br/>As doth the bolt, because it stood between us<br/>And our true destination--but not idly.<br/>As stranger I preserved him, and he _owed me_<br/>His _life_: when due, I but resumed the debt.<br/>He, you, and I stood o'er a gulf wherein<br/>I have plunged our enemy. _You_ kindled first<br/>The torch--_you_ showed the path; now trace me that<br/>Of safety--or let me!<br/><br/>_Sieg._               I have done with life!<br/><br/>_Ulr._ Let us have done with that which cankers life--<br/>Familiar feuds and vain recriminations<br/>Of things which cannot be undone. We have<br/>No more to learn or hide: I know no fear,<br/>And have within these very walls men who<br/>(Although you know them not) dare venture all things.<br/>You stand high with the state; what passes here<br/>Will not excite her too great curiosity:<br/>Keep your own secret, keep a steady eye,<br/>Stir not, and speak not;--leave the rest to me:<br/>We must have no _third_ babblers thrust between us.<br/>                                                        [_Exit_ ULRIC.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ (_solus_). Am I awake? are these my father's halls?<br/>And _you_--my son? _My_ son! _mine!_ I who have ever<br/>Abhorred both mystery and blood, and yet<br/>Am plunged into the deepest hell of both!<br/>I must be speedy, or more will be shed--<br/>The Hungarian's!--Ulric--he hath partisans,<br/>It seems: I might have guessed as much. Oh fool!<br/>Wolves prowl in company. He hath the key<br/>(As I too) of the opposite door which leads<br/>Into the turret. Now then! or once more<br/>To be the father of fresh crimes, no less<br/>Than of the criminal! Ho! Gabor! Gabor!<br/>                  [_Exit into the turret, closing the door after him_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_The Interior of the Turret_.<br/><br/>                     GABOR _and_ SIEGENDORF.<br/><br/>_Gab._ Who calls?<br/><br/>_Sieg._           I--Siegendorf! Take these and fly!<br/>Lose not a moment!<br/><br/>              [_Tears off a diamond star and other jewels, and thrusts<br/>                    them into_ GABOR'S _hand_.<br/><br/>_Gab._               What am I to do<br/>With these?<br/><br/>_Sieg._    Whate'er you will: sell them, or hoard,<br/>And prosper; but delay not, or you are lost!<br/><br/>_Gab._ You pledged your honour for my safety!<br/><br/>_Sieg._                                        And<br/>Must thus redeem it. Fly! I am not master,<br/>It seems, of my own castle--of my own<br/>Retainers--nay, even of these very walls,<br/>Or I would bid them fall and crush me! Fly!<br/>Or you will be slain by----<br/><br/>_Gab._                      Is it even so?<br/>Farewell, then! Recollect, however, Count,<br/>You sought this fatal interview!<br/><br/>_Sieg._                          I did:<br/>Let it not be more fatal still!--Begone!<br/><br/>_Gab._ By the same path I entered?<br/><br/>_Sieg._                           Yes; that's safe still;<br/>But loiter not in Prague;--you do not know<br/>With whom you have to deal.<br/><br/>_Gab._                     I know too well--<br/>And knew it ere yourself, unhappy Sire!<br/>Farewell!                                               [_Exit_ GABOR.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ (_solus and listening_).<br/>          He hath cleared the staircase. Ah! I hear<br/>The door sound loud behind him! He is safe!<br/>Safe!--Oh, my father's spirit!--I am faint--<br/><br/>                   [_He leans down upon a stone seat, near the wall of<br/>                         the tower, in a drooping posture_.<br/><br/>    _Enter_ ULRIC _with others armed, and with weapons drawn_.<br/><br/>_Ulr._ Despatch!--he's there!<br/><br/>_Lud._                       The Count, my Lord!<br/><br/>_Ulr._ (_recognizing_ SIEGENDORF).              _You_ here, sir!<br/><br/>_Sieg._ Yes: if you want another victim, strike!<br/><br/>_Ulr._ (_seeing him stript of his jewels_).<br/>Where is the ruffian who hath plundered you?<br/>Vassals, despatch in search of him! You see<br/>'Twas as I said--the wretch hath stript my father<br/>Of jewels which might form a Prince's heir-loom!<br/>Away! I'll follow you forthwith.<br/>                             [_Exeunt all but_ SIEGENDORF _and_ ULRIC.<br/>                                What's this?<br/>Where is the villain?<br/><br/>_Sieg._            There are _two_, sir: which<br/>Are you in quest of?<br/><br/>_Ulr._              Let us hear no more<br/>Of this: he must be found. You have not let him<br/>Escape?<br/><br/>_Sieg._ He's gone.<br/><br/>_Ulr._             With your connivance?<br/><br/>_Sieg._                                 With<br/>My fullest, freest aid.<br/><br/>_Ulr._                 Then fare you well!<br/>                                                    [ULRIC _is going_.<br/><br/>_Sieg._ Stop! I command--entreat--implore! Oh, Ulric!<br/>Will you then leave me?<br/><br/>_Ulr._                  What! remain to be<br/>Denounced--dragged, it may be, in chains; and all<br/>By your inherent weakness, half-humanity,<br/>Selfish remorse, and temporizing pity,<br/>That sacrifices your whole race to save<br/>A wretch to profit by our ruin! No, Count,<br/>Henceforth you have no son!<br/><br/>_Sieg._                     I never had one;<br/>And would you ne'er had borne the useless name!<br/>Where will you go? I would not send you forth<br/>Without protection.<br/><br/>_Ulr._              Leave that unto me.<br/>I am not alone; nor merely the vain heir<br/>Of your domains; a thousand, aye, ten thousand<br/>Swords, hearts, and hands are mine.<br/><br/>_Sieg._                             The foresters!<br/>With whom the Hungarian found you first at Frankfort!<br/><br/>_Ulr._ Yes--men--who are worthy of the name! Go tell<br/>Your Senators that they look well to Prague;<br/>Their Feast of Peace was early for the times;<br/>There are more spirits abroad than have been laid<br/>With Wallenstein!<br/><br/>                   _Enter_ JOSEPHINE _and_ IDA.<br/><br/>_Jos._              What is't we hear?
