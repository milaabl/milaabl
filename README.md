# üíÆ Ballad. to the Tune of "Salley in Our Alley." by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    OF all the twice ten thousand bards<br/>  That ever penned a canto,<br/>Whom Pudding or whom Praise rewards<br/>  For lining a portmanteau;<br/>Of all the poets ever known,<br/>  From Grub-street to Fop's Alley,<br/>The Muse may boast--the World must own<br/>  There's none like pretty Gally!<br/><br/>He writes as well as any Miss,<br/>  Has published many a poem;<br/>The shame is yours, the gain is his,<br/>  In case you should not know 'em:<br/>He has ten thousand pounds a year--<br/>  I do not mean to vally--<br/>His songs at sixpence would be dear,<br/>  So give them gratis, Gaily!<br/><br/>And if this statement should seem queer,<br/>  Or set down in a hurry,<br/>Go, ask (if he will be sincere)<br/>  His bookseller--John Murray.<br/>Come, say, how many have been sold,<br/>  And don't stand shilly-shally,<br/>Of bound and lettered, red and gold,<br/>  Well printed works of Gally.<br/><br/>For Astley's circus Upton writes,<br/>  And also for the Surry; (_sic_)<br/>Fitzgerald weekly still recites,<br/>  Though grinning Critics worry:<br/>Miss Holford's Peg, and Sotheby's Saul,<br/>  In fame exactly tally;<br/>From Stationer's Hall to Grocer's Stall<br/>  They go--and so does Gally.<br/><br/>He rode upon a Camel's hump<br/>  Through Araby the sandy,<br/>Which surely must have hurt the rump<br/>  Of this poetic dandy.<br/>His rhymes are of the costive kind,<br/>  And barren as each valley<br/>In deserts which he left behind<br/>  Has been the Muse of Gally.<br/><br/>He has a Seat in Parliament,<br/>  Is fat and passing wealthy;<br/>And surely he should be content<br/>  With these and being healthy:<br/>But Great Ambition will misrule<br/>  Men at all risks to sally,--<br/>Now makes a poet--now a fool,<br/>  And _we_ know _which_--of Gally.<br/><br/>Some in the playhouse like to row,<br/>  Some with the Watch to battle,<br/>Exchanging many a midnight blow<br/>  To Music of the Rattle.<br/>Some folks like rowing on the Thames,<br/>  Some rowing in an Alley,<br/>But all the Row my fancy claims<br/>  Is _rowing_--of my _Gally_.<br/><br/>  "Th' unloaded camel, pacing slow.<br/>Crops the rough herbage or the tamarisk spray."
