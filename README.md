# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Second Nun's Tale by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    The minister and norice unto vices,<br/>Which that men call in English idleness,<br/>The porter at the gate is of delices;<br/>T'eschew, and by her contrar' her oppress, --<br/>That is to say, by lawful business, --<br/>Well oughte we to do our all intent<br/>Lest that the fiend through idleness us hent.<br/><br/>For he, that with his thousand cordes sly<br/>Continually us waiteth to beclap,<br/>When he may man in idleness espy,<br/>He can so lightly catch him in his trap,<br/>Till that a man be hent right by the lappe,<br/>He is not ware the fiend hath him in hand;<br/>Well ought we work, and idleness withstand.<br/><br/>And though men dreaded never for to die,<br/>Yet see men well by reason, doubteless,<br/>That idleness is root of sluggardy,<br/>Of which there cometh never good increase;<br/>And see that sloth them holdeth in a leas,<br/>Only to sleep, and for to eat and drink,<br/>And to devouren all that others swink.<br/><br/>And, for to put us from such idleness,<br/>That cause is of so great confusion,<br/>I have here done my faithful business,<br/>After the Legend, in translation<br/>Right of thy glorious life and passion, --<br/>Thou with thy garland wrought of rose and lily,<br/>Thee mean I, maid and martyr, Saint Cecilie.<br/><br/>And thou, thou art the flow'r of virgins all,<br/>Of whom that Bernard list so well to write,<br/>To thee at my beginning first I call;<br/>Thou comfort of us wretches, do me indite<br/>Thy maiden's death, that won through her merite<br/>Th' eternal life, and o'er the fiend victory,<br/>As man may after readen in her story.<br/><br/>Thou maid and mother, daughter of thy Son,<br/>Thou well of mercy, sinful soules' cure,<br/>In whom that God of bounte chose to won;<br/>Thou humble and high o'er every creature,<br/>Thou nobilest, so far forth our nature,<br/>That no disdain the Maker had of kind,<br/>His Son in blood and flesh to clothe and wind.<br/><br/>Within the cloister of thy blissful sides<br/>Took manne's shape th' eternal love and peace,<br/>That of the trine compass Lord and guide is<br/>Whom earth, and sea, and heav'n, out of release,<br/>Aye hery; and thou, Virgin wemmeless,<br/>Bare of thy body, and dweltest maiden pure,<br/>The Creator of every creature.<br/><br/>Assembled is in thee magnificence<br/>With mercy, goodness, and with such pity,<br/>That thou, that art the sun of excellence,<br/>Not only helpest them that pray to thee,<br/>But oftentime, of thy benignity,<br/>Full freely, ere that men thine help beseech,<br/>Thou go'st before, and art their lives' leech.<br/><br/>Now help, thou meek and blissful faire maid,<br/>Me, flemed wretch, in this desert of gall;<br/>Think on the woman Cananee that said<br/>That whelpes eat some of the crumbes all<br/>That from their Lorde's table be y-fall;<br/>And though that I, unworthy son of Eve,<br/>Be sinful, yet accepte my believe.<br/><br/>And, for that faith is dead withoute werkes,<br/>For to worke give me wit and space,<br/>That I be quit from thennes that most derk is;<br/>O thou, that art so fair and full of grace,<br/>Be thou mine advocate in that high place,<br/>Where as withouten end is sung Osanne,<br/>Thou Christe's mother, daughter dear of Anne.<br/><br/>And of thy light my soul in prison light,<br/>That troubled is by the contagion<br/>Of my body, and also by the weight<br/>Of earthly lust and false affection;<br/>O hav'n of refuge, O salvation<br/>Of them that be in sorrow and distress,<br/>Now help, for to my work I will me dress.<br/><br/>Yet pray I you, that reade what I write,<br/>Forgive me that I do no diligence<br/>This ilke story subtilly t' indite.<br/>For both have I the wordes and sentence<br/>Of him that at the sainte's reverence<br/>The story wrote, and follow her legend;<br/>And pray you that you will my work amend.<br/><br/>First will I you the name of Saint Cecilie<br/>Expound, as men may in her story see.<br/>It is to say in English, Heaven's lily,<br/>For pure chasteness of virginity;<br/>Or, for she whiteness had of honesty,<br/>And green of conscience, and of good fame<br/>The sweete savour, Lilie was her name.<br/><br/>Or Cecilie is to say, the way of blind;<br/>For she example was by good teaching;<br/>Or else Cecilie, as I written find,<br/>Is joined by a manner conjoining<br/>Of heaven and Lia,  and herein figuring<br/>The heaven is set for thought of holiness,<br/>And Lia for her lasting business.<br/><br/>Cecilie may eke be said in this mannere,<br/>Wanting of blindness, for her greate light<br/>Of sapience, and for her thewes clear.<br/>Or elles, lo, this maiden's name bright<br/>Of heaven and Leos  comes, for which by right<br/>Men might her well the heaven of people call,<br/>Example of good and wise workes all;<br/><br/>For Leos people in English is to say;<br/>And right as men may in the heaven see<br/>The sun and moon, and starres every way,<br/>Right so men ghostly, in this maiden free,<br/>Sawen of faith the magnanimity,<br/>And eke the clearness whole of sapience,<br/>And sundry workes bright of excellence.<br/><br/>And right so as these philosophers write,<br/>That heav'n is swift and round, and eke burning,<br/>Right so was faire Cecilie the white<br/>Full swift and busy in every good working,<br/>And round and whole in good persevering,<br/>And burning ever in charity full bright;<br/>Now have I you declared what she hight.<br/><br/>This maiden bright Cecile, as her life saith,<br/>Was come of Romans, and of noble kind,<br/>And from her cradle foster'd in the faith<br/>Of Christ, and bare his Gospel in her mind:<br/>She never ceased, as I written find,<br/>Of her prayere, and God to love and dread,<br/>Beseeching him to keep her maidenhead.<br/><br/>And when this maiden should unto a man<br/>Y-wedded be, that was full young of age,<br/>Which that y-called was Valerian,<br/>And come was the day of marriage,<br/>She, full devout and humble in her corage,<br/>Under her robe of gold, that sat full fair,<br/>Had next her flesh y-clad her in an hair.<br/><br/>And while the organs made melody,<br/>To God alone thus in her heart sang she;<br/>"O Lord, my soul and eke my body gie<br/>Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be."<br/>And, for his love that died upon the tree,<br/>Every second or third day she fast',<br/>Aye bidding in her orisons full fast.<br/><br/>The night came, and to bedde must she gon<br/>With her husband, as it is the mannere;<br/>And privily she said to him anon;<br/>"O sweet and well-beloved spouse dear,<br/>There is a counsel, an' ye will it hear,<br/>Which that right fain I would unto you say,<br/>So that ye swear ye will it not bewray."<br/><br/>Valerian gan fast unto her swear<br/>That for no case nor thing that mighte be,<br/>He never should to none bewrayen her;<br/>And then at erst thus to him saide she;<br/>"I have an angel which that loveth me,<br/>That with great love, whether I wake or sleep,<br/>Is ready aye my body for to keep;<br/><br/>"And if that he may feelen, out of dread,<br/>That ye me touch or love in villainy,<br/>He right anon will slay you with the deed,<br/>And in your youthe thus ye shoulde die.<br/>And if that ye in cleane love me gie,"<br/>He will you love as me, for your cleanness,<br/>And shew to you his joy and his brightness."<br/><br/>Valerian, corrected as God wo'ld,<br/>Answer'd again, "If I shall truste thee,<br/>Let me that angel see, and him behold;<br/>And if that it a very angel be,<br/>Then will I do as thou hast prayed me;<br/>And if thou love another man, forsooth<br/>Right with this sword then will I slay you both."<br/><br/>Cecile answer'd anon right in this wise;<br/>"If that you list, the angel shall ye see,<br/>So that ye trow Of Christ, and you baptise;<br/>Go forth to Via Appia," quoth she,<br/>That from this towne stands but miles three,<br/>And to the poore folkes that there dwell<br/>Say them right thus, as that I shall you tell,<br/><br/>"Tell them, that I, Cecile, you to them sent<br/>To shewe you the good Urban the old,<br/>For secret needes, and for good intent;<br/>And when that ye Saint Urban have behold,<br/>Tell him the wordes which I to you told<br/>And when that he hath purged you from sin,<br/>Then shall ye see that angel ere ye twin<br/><br/>Valerian is to the place gone;<br/>And, right as he was taught by her learning<br/>He found this holy old Urban anon<br/>Among the saintes' burials louting;<br/>And he anon, withoute tarrying,<br/>Did his message, and when that he it told,<br/>Urban for joy his handes gan uphold.<br/><br/>The teares from his eyen let he fall;<br/>"Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ,"<br/>Quoth he, "Sower of chaste counsel, herd of us all;<br/>The fruit of thilke seed of chastity<br/>That thou hast sown in Cecile, take to thee<br/>Lo, like a busy bee, withoute guile,<br/>Thee serveth aye thine owen thrall Cicile,<br/><br/>"For thilke spouse, that she took but now,<br/>Full like a fierce lion, she sendeth here,<br/>As meek as e'er was any lamb to owe."<br/>And with that word anon there gan appear<br/>An old man, clad in white clothes clear,<br/>That had a book with letters of gold in hand,<br/>And gan before Valerian to stand.<br/><br/>Valerian, as dead, fell down for dread,<br/>When he him saw; and he up hent him tho,<br/>And on his book right thus he gan to read;<br/>"One Lord, one faith, one God withoute mo',<br/>One Christendom, one Father of all also,<br/>Aboven all, and over all everywhere."<br/>These wordes all with gold y-written were.<br/><br/>When this was read, then said this olde man,<br/>"Believ'st thou this or no? say yea or nay."<br/>"I believe all this," quoth Valerian,<br/>"For soother thing than this, I dare well say,<br/>Under the Heaven no wight thinke may."<br/>Then vanish'd the old man, he wist not where<br/>And Pope Urban him christened right there.<br/><br/>Valerian went home, and found Cecilie<br/>Within his chamber with an angel stand;<br/>This angel had of roses and of lily<br/>Corones two, the which he bare in hand,<br/>And first to Cecile, as I understand,<br/>He gave the one, and after gan he take<br/>The other to Valerian her make.<br/><br/>"With body clean, and with unwemmed thought,<br/>Keep aye well these corones two," quoth he;<br/>"From Paradise to you I have them brought,<br/>Nor ever more shall they rotten be,<br/>Nor lose their sweet savour, truste me,<br/>Nor ever wight shall see them with his eye,<br/>But he be chaste, and hate villainy.<br/><br/>"And thou, Valerian, for thou so soon<br/>Assented hast to good counsel, also<br/>Say what thee list, and thou shalt have thy boon."<br/>"I have a brother," quoth Valerian tho,<br/>"That in this world I love no man so;<br/>I pray you that my brother may have grace<br/>To know the truth, as I do in this place."<br/><br/>The angel said, "God liketh thy request,<br/>And bothe, with the palm of martyrdom,<br/>Ye shalle come unto this blissful rest."<br/>And, with that word, Tiburce his brother came.<br/>And when that he the savour undernome<br/>Which that the roses and the lilies cast,<br/>Within his heart he gan to wonder fast;<br/><br/>And said; "I wonder, this time of the year,<br/>Whence that sweete savour cometh so<br/>Of rose and lilies, that I smelle here;<br/>For though I had them in mine handes two,<br/>The savour might in me no deeper go;<br/>The sweete smell, that in my heart I find,<br/>Hath changed me all in another kind."<br/><br/>Valerian said, "Two crownes here have we,<br/>Snow-white and rose-red, that shine clear,<br/>Which that thine eyen have no might to see;<br/>And, as thou smellest them through my prayere,<br/>So shalt thou see them, leve brother dear,<br/>If it so be thou wilt withoute sloth<br/>Believe aright, and know the very troth. "<br/><br/>Tiburce answered, "Say'st thou this to me<br/>In soothness, or in dreame hear I this?"<br/>"In dreames," quoth Valorian, "have we be<br/>Unto this time, brother mine, y-wis<br/>But now at erst in truth our dwelling is."<br/>How know'st thou this," quoth Tiburce; "in what wise?"<br/>Quoth Valerian, "That shall I thee devise<br/><br/>"The angel of God hath me the truth y-taught,<br/>Which thou shalt see, if that thou wilt reny<br/>The idols, and be clean, and elles nought."<br/>[And of the miracle of these crownes tway<br/>Saint Ambrose in his preface list to say;<br/>Solemnely this noble doctor dear<br/>Commendeth it, and saith in this mannere<br/><br/>"The palm of martyrdom for to receive,<br/>Saint Cecilie, full filled of God's gift,<br/>The world and eke her chamber gan to weive;<br/>Witness Tiburce's and Cecilie's shrift,<br/>To which God of his bounty woulde shift<br/>Corones two, of flowers well smelling,<br/>And made his angel them the crownes bring.<br/><br/>"The maid hath brought these men to bliss above;<br/>The world hath wist what it is worth, certain,<br/>Devotion of chastity to love."]<br/>Then showed him Cecilie all open and plain,<br/>That idols all are but a thing in vain,<br/>For they be dumb, and thereto they be deave;<br/>And charged him his idols for to leave.<br/><br/>"Whoso that troweth not this, a beast he is,"<br/>Quoth this Tiburce, "if that I shall not lie."<br/>And she gan kiss his breast when she heard this,<br/>And was full glad he could the truth espy:<br/>"This day I take thee for mine ally."<br/>Saide this blissful faire maiden dear;<br/>And after that she said as ye may hear.<br/><br/>"Lo, right so as the love of Christ," quoth she,<br/>"Made me thy brother's wife, right in that wise<br/>Anon for mine ally here take I thee,<br/>Since that thou wilt thine idoles despise.<br/>Go with thy brother now and thee baptise,<br/>And make thee clean, so that thou may'st behold<br/>The angel's face, of which thy brother told."<br/><br/>Tiburce answer'd, and saide, "Brother dear,<br/>First tell me whither I shall, and to what man?"<br/>"To whom?" quoth he, "come forth with goode cheer,<br/>I will thee lead unto the Pope Urban."<br/>"To Urban? brother mine Valerian,"<br/>Quoth then Tiburce; "wilt thou me thither lead?<br/>Me thinketh that it were a wondrous deed.<br/><br/>"Meanest thou not that Urban," quoth he tho,<br/>"That is so often damned to be dead,<br/>And wons in halkes always to and fro,<br/>And dare not ones putte forth his head?<br/>Men should him brennen in a fire so red,<br/>If he were found, or if men might him spy:<br/>And us also, to bear him company.<br/><br/>"And while we seeke that Divinity<br/>That is y-hid in heaven privily,<br/>Algate burnt in this world should we be."<br/>To whom Cecilie answer'd boldely;<br/>"Men mighte dreade well and skilfully<br/>This life to lose, mine owen deare brother,<br/>If this were living only, and none other.<br/><br/>"But there is better life in other place,<br/>That never shall be loste, dread thee nought;<br/>Which Godde's Son us tolde through his grace<br/>That Father's Son which alle thinges wrought;<br/>And all that wrought is with a skilful thought,<br/>The Ghost, that from the Father gan proceed,<br/>Hath souled them, withouten any drede.<br/><br/>By word and by miracle, high God's Son,<br/>When he was in this world, declared here.<br/>That there is other life where men may won."<br/>To whom answer'd Tiburce, "O sister dear,<br/>Saidest thou not right now in this mannere,<br/>There was but one God, Lord in soothfastness,<br/>And now of three how may'st thou bear witness?"<br/><br/>"That shall I tell," quoth she, "ere that I go.<br/>Right as a man hath sapiences three,<br/>Memory, engine, and intellect also,<br/>So in one being of divinity<br/>Three persones there maye right well be."<br/>Then gan she him full busily to preach<br/>Of Christe's coming, and his paines teach,<br/><br/>And many pointes of his passion;<br/>How Godde's Son in this world was withhold<br/>To do mankinde plein remission,<br/>That was y-bound in sin and cares cold.<br/>All this thing she unto Tiburce told,<br/>And after that Tiburce, in good intent,<br/>With Valerian to Pope Urban he went.<br/><br/>That thanked God, and with glad heart and light<br/>He christen'd him, and made him in that place<br/>Perfect in his learning, and Godde's knight.<br/>And after this Tiburce got such grace,<br/>That every day he saw in time and space<br/>Th' angel of God, and every manner boon<br/>That be God asked, it was sped full anon.<br/><br/>It were full hard by order for to sayn<br/>How many wonders Jesus for them wrought,<br/>But at the last, to telle short and plain,<br/>The sergeants of the town of Rome them sought,<br/>And them before Almach the Prefect brought,<br/>Which them apposed, and knew all their intent,<br/>And to th'image of Jupiter them sent.<br/><br/>And said, "Whoso will not do sacrifice,<br/>Swap off his head, this is my sentence here."<br/>Anon these martyrs, that I you devise,<br/>One Maximus, that was an officere<br/>Of the prefect's, and his corniculere<br/>Them hent, and when he forth the saintes lad,<br/>Himself he wept for pity that he had.<br/><br/>When Maximus had heard the saintes lore,<br/>He got him of the tormentores leave,<br/>And led them to his house withoute more;<br/>And with their preaching, ere that it were eve,<br/>They gonnen from the tormentors to reave,<br/>And from Maxim', and from his folk each one,<br/>The false faith, to trow in God alone.<br/><br/>Cecilia came, when it was waxen night,<br/>With priestes, that them christen'd all in fere;<br/>And afterward, when day was waxen light,<br/>Cecile them said with a full steadfast cheer,<br/>"Now, Christe's owen knightes lefe and dear,<br/>Cast all away the workes of darkness,<br/>And arme you in armour of brightness.<br/><br/>Ye have forsooth y-done a great battaile,<br/>Your course is done, your faith have ye conserved;<br/>O to the crown of life that may not fail;<br/>The rightful Judge, which that ye have served<br/>Shall give it you, as ye have it deserved."<br/>And when this thing was said, as I devise,<br/>Men led them forth to do the sacrifice.<br/><br/>But when they were unto the place brought<br/>To telle shortly the conclusion,<br/>They would incense nor sacrifice right nought<br/>But on their knees they sette them adown,<br/>With humble heart and sad devotion,<br/>And loste both their heades in the place;<br/>Their soules wente to the King of grace.<br/><br/>This Maximus, that saw this thing betide,<br/>With piteous teares told it anon right,<br/>That he their soules saw to heaven glide<br/>With angels, full of clearness and of light<br/>Andt with his word converted many a wight.<br/>For which Almachius did him to-beat<br/>With whip of lead, till he his life gan lete.<br/><br/>Cecile him took, and buried him anon<br/>By Tiburce and Valerian softely,<br/>Within their burying-place, under the stone.<br/>And after this Almachius hastily<br/>Bade his ministers fetchen openly<br/>Cecile, so that she might in his presence<br/>Do sacrifice, and Jupiter incense.<br/><br/>But they, converted at her wise lore,<br/>Wepte full sore, and gave full credence<br/>Unto her word, and cried more and more;<br/>"Christ, Godde's Son, withoute difference,<br/>Is very God, this is all our sentence,<br/>That hath so good a servant him to serve<br/>Thus with one voice we trowe, though we sterve.<br/><br/>Almachius, that heard of this doing,<br/>Bade fetch Cecilie, that he might her see;<br/>And alderfirst, lo, this was his asking;<br/>"What manner woman arte thou?" quoth he,<br/>"I am a gentle woman born," quoth she.<br/>"I aske thee," quoth he,"though it thee grieve,<br/>Of thy religion and of thy believe."<br/><br/>"Ye have begun your question foolishly,"<br/>Quoth she, "that wouldest two answers conclude<br/>In one demand? ye aske lewedly."<br/>Almach answer'd to that similitude,<br/>"Of whence comes thine answering so rude?"<br/>"Of whence?" quoth she, when that she was freined,<br/>"Of conscience, and of good faith unfeigned."<br/><br/>Almachius saide; "Takest thou no heed<br/>Of my power?" and she him answer'd this;<br/>"Your might," quoth she, "full little is to dread;<br/>For every mortal manne's power is<br/>But like a bladder full of wind, y-wis;<br/>For with a needle's point, when it is blow',<br/>May all the boast of it be laid full low."<br/><br/>"Full wrongfully begunnest thou," quoth he,<br/>"And yet in wrong is thy perseverance.<br/>Know'st thou not how our mighty princes free<br/>Have thus commanded and made ordinance,<br/>That every Christian wight shall have penance,<br/>But if that he his Christendom withsay,<br/>And go all quit, if he will it renay?"<br/><br/>"Your princes erren, as your nobley doth,"<br/>Quoth then Cecile, "and with a wood sentence<br/>Ye make us guilty, and it is not sooth:<br/>For ye that knowe well our innocence,<br/>Forasmuch as we do aye reverence<br/>To Christ, and for we bear a Christian name,<br/>Ye put on us a crime and eke a blame.<br/><br/>"But we that knowe thilke name so<br/>For virtuous, we may it not withsay."<br/>Almach answered, "Choose one of these two,<br/>Do sacrifice, or Christendom renay,<br/>That thou may'st now escape by that way."<br/>At which the holy blissful faire maid<br/>Gan for to laugh, and to the judge said;<br/><br/>"O judge, confused in thy nicety,<br/>Wouldest thou that I reny innocence?<br/>To make me a wicked wight," quoth she,<br/>"Lo, he dissimuleth here in audience;<br/>He stareth and woodeth in his advertence."<br/>To whom Almachius said, "Unsely wretch,<br/>Knowest thou not how far my might may stretch?<br/><br/>"Have not our mighty princes to me given<br/>Yea bothe power and eke authority<br/>To make folk to dien or to liven?<br/>Why speakest thou so proudly then to me?"<br/>"I speake not but steadfastly," quoth she,<br/>Not proudly, for I say, as for my side,<br/>We hate deadly thilke vice of pride.<br/><br/>"And, if thou dreade not a sooth to hear,<br/>Then will I shew all openly by right,<br/>That thou hast made a full great leasing here.<br/>Thou say'st thy princes have thee given might<br/>Both for to slay and for to quick a wight, --<br/>Thou that may'st not but only life bereave;<br/>Thou hast none other power nor no leave.<br/><br/>"But thou may'st say, thy princes have thee maked<br/>Minister of death; for if thou speak of mo',<br/>Thou liest; for thy power is full naked."<br/>"Do away thy boldness," said Almachius tho,<br/>"And sacrifice to our gods, ere thou go.<br/>I recke not what wrong that thou me proffer,<br/>For I can suffer it as a philosopher.<br/><br/>"But those wronges may I not endure,<br/>That thou speak'st of our goddes here," quoth he.<br/>Cecile answer'd, "O nice creature,<br/>Thou saidest no word, since thou spake to me,<br/>That I knew not therewith thy nicety,<br/>And that thou wert in every manner wise<br/>A lewed officer, a vain justice.<br/><br/>"There lacketh nothing to thine outward eyen<br/>That thou art blind; for thing that we see all<br/>That it is stone, that men may well espyen,<br/>That ilke stone a god thou wilt it call.<br/>I rede thee let thine hand upon it fall,<br/>And taste it well, and stone thou shalt it find;<br/>Since that thou see'st not with thine eyen blind.<br/><br/>"It is a shame that the people shall<br/>So scorne thee, and laugh at thy folly;<br/>For commonly men wot it well over all,<br/>That mighty God is in his heaven high;<br/>And these images, well may'st thou espy,<br/>To thee nor to themselves may not profite,<br/>For in effect they be not worth a mite."<br/><br/>These wordes and such others saide she,<br/>And he wax'd wroth, and bade men should her lead<br/>Home to her house; "And in her house," quoth he,<br/>"Burn her right in a bath, with flames red."<br/>And as he bade, right so was done the deed;<br/>For in a bath they gan her faste shetten,<br/>And night and day great fire they under betten.<br/><br/>The longe night, and eke a day also,<br/>For all the fire, and eke the bathe's heat,<br/>She sat all cold, and felt of it no woe,<br/>It made her not one droppe for to sweat;<br/>But in that bath her life she must lete.<br/>For he, Almachius, with full wick' intent,<br/>To slay her in the bath his sonde sent.<br/><br/>Three strokes in the neck he smote her tho,<br/>The tormentor, but for no manner chance<br/>He might not smite her faire neck in two:<br/>And, for there was that time an ordinance<br/>That no man should do man such penance,<br/>The fourthe stroke to smite, soft or sore,<br/>This tormentor he durste do no more;<br/><br/>But half dead, with her necke carven there<br/>He let her lie, and on his way is went.<br/>The Christian folk, which that about her were,<br/>With sheetes have the blood full fair y-hent;<br/>Three dayes lived she in this torment,<br/>And never ceased them the faith to teach,<br/>That she had foster'd them, she gan to preach.<br/><br/>And them she gave her mebles and her thing,<br/>And to the Pope Urban betook them tho;<br/>And said, "I aske this of heaven's king,<br/>To have respite three dayes and no mo',<br/>To recommend to you, ere that I go,<br/>These soules, lo; and that I might do wirch<br/>Here of mine house perpetually a church."<br/><br/>Saint Urban, with his deacons, privily<br/>The body fetch'd, and buried it by night<br/>Among his other saintes honestly;<br/>Her house the church of Saint Cecilie hight;<br/>Saint Urban hallow'd it, as he well might;<br/>In which unto this day, in noble wise,<br/>Men do to Christ and to his saint service.
