# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Pardoner's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>OUR Hoste gan to swear as he were wood;<br/>"Harow!" quoth he, "by nailes and by blood,<br/>This was a cursed thief, a false justice.<br/>As shameful death as hearte can devise<br/>Come to these judges and their advoca's.<br/>Algate this sely maid is slain, alas!<br/>Alas! too deare bought she her beauty.<br/>Wherefore I say, that all day man may see<br/>That giftes of fortune and of nature<br/>Be cause of death to many a creature.<br/>Her beauty was her death, I dare well sayn;<br/>Alas! so piteously as she was slain.<br/>[Of bothe giftes, that I speak of now<br/>Men have full often more harm than prow,]<br/>But truely, mine owen master dear,<br/>This was a piteous tale for to hear;<br/>But natheless, pass over; 'tis no force.<br/>I pray to God to save thy gentle corse,<br/>And eke thine urinals, and thy jordans,<br/>Thine Hippocras, and eke thy Galliens,<br/>And every boist full of thy lectuary,<br/>God bless them, and our lady Sainte Mary.<br/>So may I the', thou art a proper man,<br/>And like a prelate, by Saint Ronian;<br/>Said I not well? Can I not speak in term?<br/>But well I wot thou dost mine heart to erme,<br/>That I have almost caught a cardiacle:<br/>By corpus Domini , but I have triacle,<br/>Or else a draught of moist and corny  ale,<br/>Or but I hear anon a merry tale,<br/>Mine heart is brost for pity of this maid.<br/>Thou bel ami, thou Pardoner," he said,<br/>"Tell us some mirth of japes right anon."<br/>"It shall be done," quoth he, "by Saint Ronion.<br/>But first," quoth he, "here at this ale-stake<br/>I will both drink, and biten on a cake."<br/>But right anon the gentles gan to cry,<br/>"Nay, let him tell us of no ribaldry.<br/>Tell us some moral thing, that we may lear<br/>Some wit, and thenne will we gladly hear."<br/>"I grant y-wis," quoth he; "but I must think<br/>Upon some honest thing while that I drink."<br/><br/>THE TALE<br/><br/>Lordings (quoth he), in churche when I preach,<br/>I paine me to have an hautein speech,<br/>And ring it out, as round as doth a bell,<br/>For I know all by rote that I tell.<br/>My theme is always one, and ever was;<br/>Radix malorum est cupiditas.<br/>First I pronounce whence that I come,<br/>And then my bulles shew I all and some;<br/>Our liege lorde's seal on my patent,<br/>That shew I first, my body to warrent,<br/>That no man be so hardy, priest nor clerk,<br/>Me to disturb of Christe's holy werk.<br/>And after that then tell I forth my tales.<br/>Bulles of popes, and of cardinales,<br/>Of patriarchs, and of bishops I shew,<br/>And in Latin I speak a wordes few,<br/>To savour with my predication,<br/>And for to stir men to devotion<br/>Then show I forth my longe crystal stones,<br/>Y-crammed fall of cloutes and of bones;<br/>Relics they be, as weene they each one.<br/>Then have I in latoun a shoulder-bone<br/>Which that was of a holy Jewe's sheep.<br/>"Good men," say I, "take of my wordes keep;<br/>If that this bone be wash'd in any well,<br/>If cow, or calf, or sheep, or oxe swell,<br/>That any worm hath eat, or worm y-stung,<br/>Take water of that well, and wash his tongue,<br/>And it is whole anon; and farthermore<br/>Of pockes, and of scab, and every sore<br/>Shall every sheep be whole, that of this well<br/>Drinketh a draught; take keep of that I tell.<br/><br/>"If that the goodman, that the beastes oweth,<br/>Will every week, ere that the cock him croweth,<br/>Fasting, y-drinken of this well a draught,<br/>As thilke holy Jew our elders taught,<br/>His beastes and his store shall multiply.<br/>And, Sirs, also it healeth jealousy;<br/>For though a man be fall'n in jealous rage,<br/>Let make with this water his pottage,<br/>And never shall he more his wife mistrist,<br/>Though he the sooth of her defaulte wist;<br/>All had she taken priestes two or three.<br/>Here is a mittain eke, that ye may see;<br/>He that his hand will put in this mittain,<br/>He shall have multiplying of his grain,<br/>When he hath sowen, be it wheat or oats,<br/>So that he offer pence, or elles groats.<br/>And, men and women, one thing warn I you;<br/>If any wight be in this churche now<br/>That hath done sin horrible, so that he<br/>Dare not for shame of it y-shriven be;<br/>Or any woman, be she young or old,<br/>That hath y-made her husband cokewold,<br/>Such folk shall have no power nor no grace<br/>To offer to my relics in this place.<br/>And whoso findeth him out of such blame,<br/>He will come up and offer in God's name;<br/>And I assoil him by the authority<br/>Which that by bull y-granted was to me."<br/><br/>By this gaud have I wonne year by year<br/>A hundred marks, since I was pardonere.<br/>I stande like a clerk in my pulpit,<br/>And when the lewed people down is set,<br/>I preache so as ye have heard before,<br/>And telle them a hundred japes more.<br/>Then pain I me to stretche forth my neck,<br/>And east and west upon the people I beck,<br/>As doth a dove, sitting on a bern;<br/>My handes and my tongue go so yern,<br/>That it is joy to see my business.<br/>Of avarice and of such cursedness<br/>Is all my preaching, for to make them free<br/>To give their pence, and namely unto me.<br/>For mine intent is not but for to win,<br/>And nothing for correction of sin.<br/>I recke never, when that they be buried,<br/>Though that their soules go a blackburied.<br/>For certes many a predication<br/>Cometh oft-time of evil intention;<br/>Some for pleasance of folk, and flattery,<br/>To be advanced by hypocrisy;<br/>And some for vainglory, and some for hate.<br/>For, when I dare not otherwise debate,<br/>Then will I sting him with my tongue smart<br/>In preaching, so that he shall not astart<br/>To be defamed falsely, if that he<br/>Hath trespass'd to my brethren or to me.<br/>For, though I telle not his proper name,<br/>Men shall well knowe that it is the same<br/>By signes, and by other circumstances.<br/>Thus quite I folk that do us displeasances:<br/>Thus spit I out my venom, under hue<br/>Of holiness, to seem holy and true.<br/>But, shortly mine intent I will devise,<br/>I preach of nothing but of covetise.<br/>Therefore my theme is yet, and ever was, --<br/>Radix malorum est cupiditas.<br/>Thus can I preach against the same vice<br/>Which that I use, and that is avarice.<br/>But though myself be guilty in that sin,<br/>Yet can I maken other folk to twin<br/>From avarice, and sore them repent.<br/>But that is not my principal intent;<br/>I preache nothing but for covetise.<br/>Of this mattere it ought enough suffice.<br/>Then tell I them examples many a one,<br/>Of olde stories longe time gone;<br/>For lewed people love tales old;<br/>Such thinges can they well report and hold.<br/>What? trowe ye, that whiles I may preach<br/>And winne gold and silver for I teach,<br/>That I will live in povert' wilfully?<br/>Nay, nay, I thought it never truely.<br/>For I will preach and beg in sundry lands;<br/>I will not do no labour with mine hands,<br/>Nor make baskets for to live thereby,<br/>Because I will not beggen idlely.<br/>I will none of the apostles counterfeit;<br/>I will have money, wool, and cheese, and wheat,<br/>All were it given of the poorest page,<br/>Or of the pooreste widow in a village:<br/>All should her children sterve for famine.<br/>Nay, I will drink the liquor of the vine,<br/>And have a jolly wench in every town.<br/>But hearken, lordings, in conclusioun;<br/>Your liking is, that I shall tell a tale<br/>Now I have drunk a draught of corny ale,<br/>By God, I hope I shall you tell a thing<br/>That shall by reason be to your liking;<br/>For though myself be a full vicious man,<br/>A moral tale yet I you telle can,<br/>Which I am wont to preache, for to win.<br/>Now hold your peace, my tale I will begin.<br/><br/>In Flanders whilom was a company<br/>Of younge folkes, that haunted folly,<br/>As riot, hazard, stewes, and taverns;<br/>Where as with lutes, harpes, and giterns,<br/>They dance and play at dice both day and night,<br/>And eat also, and drink over their might;<br/>Through which they do the devil sacrifice<br/>Within the devil's temple, in cursed wise,<br/>By superfluity abominable.<br/>Their oathes be so great and so damnable,<br/>That it is grisly for to hear them swear.<br/>Our blissful Lorde's body they to-tear;<br/>Them thought the Jewes rent him not enough,<br/>And each of them at other's sinne lough.<br/>And right anon in come tombesteres<br/>Fetis and small, and younge fruitesteres.<br/>Singers with harpes, baudes, waferers,<br/>Which be the very devil's officers,<br/>To kindle and blow the fire of lechery,<br/>That is annexed unto gluttony.<br/>The Holy Writ take I to my witness,<br/>That luxury is in wine and drunkenness.<br/>Lo, how that drunken Lot unkindely<br/>Lay by his daughters two unwittingly,<br/>So drunk he was he knew not what he wrought.<br/>Herodes, who so well the stories sought,<br/>When he of wine replete was at his feast,<br/>Right at his owen table gave his hest<br/>To slay the Baptist John full guilteless.<br/>Seneca saith a good word, doubteless:<br/>He saith he can no difference find<br/>Betwixt a man that is out of his mind,<br/>And a man whiche that is drunkelew:<br/>But that woodness, y-fallen in a shrew,<br/>Persevereth longer than drunkenness.<br/><br/>O gluttony, full of all cursedness;<br/>O cause first of our confusion,<br/>Original of our damnation,<br/>Till Christ had bought us with his blood again!<br/>Looke, how deare, shortly for to sayn,<br/>Abought was first this cursed villainy:<br/>Corrupt was all this world for gluttony.<br/>Adam our father, and his wife also,<br/>From Paradise, to labour and to woe,<br/>Were driven for that vice, it is no dread.<br/>For while that Adam fasted, as I read,<br/>He was in Paradise; and when that he<br/>Ate of the fruit defended of the tree,<br/>Anon he was cast out to woe and pain.<br/>O gluttony! well ought us on thee plain.<br/>Oh! wist a man how many maladies<br/>Follow of excess and of gluttonies,<br/>He woulde be the more measurable<br/>Of his diete, sitting at his table.<br/>Alas! the shorte throat, the tender mouth,<br/>Maketh that east and west, and north and south,<br/>In earth, in air, in water, men do swink<br/>To get a glutton dainty meat and drink.<br/>Of this mattere, O Paul! well canst thou treat<br/>Meat unto womb, and womb eke unto meat,<br/>Shall God destroye both, as Paulus saith.<br/>Alas! a foul thing is it, by my faith,<br/>To say this word, and fouler is the deed,<br/>When man so drinketh of the white and red,<br/>That of his throat he maketh his privy<br/>Through thilke cursed superfluity<br/>The apostle saith,  weeping full piteously,<br/>There walk many, of which you told have I, --<br/>I say it now weeping with piteous voice, --<br/>That they be enemies of Christe's crois;<br/>Of which the end is death; womb is their God.<br/>O womb, O belly, stinking is thy cod,<br/>Full fill'd of dung and of corruptioun;<br/>At either end of thee foul is the soun.<br/>How great labour and cost is thee to find!<br/>These cookes how they stamp, and strain, and grind,<br/>And turne substance into accident,<br/>To fulfill all thy likerous talent!<br/>Out of the harde bones knocke they<br/>The marrow, for they caste naught away<br/>That may go through the gullet soft and swoot<br/>Of spicery and leaves, of bark and root,<br/>Shall be his sauce y-maked by delight,<br/>To make him have a newer appetite.<br/>But, certes, he that haunteth such delices<br/>Is dead while that he liveth in those vices.<br/><br/>A lecherous thing is wine, and drunkenness<br/>Is full of striving and of wretchedness.<br/>O drunken man! disfgur'd is thy face,<br/>Sour is thy breath, foul art thou to embrace:<br/>And through thy drunken nose sowneth the soun',<br/>As though thous saidest aye, Samsoun! Samsoun!<br/>And yet, God wot, Samson drank never wine.<br/>Thou fallest as it were a sticked swine;<br/>Thy tongue is lost, and all thine honest cure;<br/>For drunkenness is very sepulture<br/>Of manne's wit and his discretion.<br/>In whom that drink hath domination,<br/>He can no counsel keep, it is no dread.<br/>Now keep you from the white and from the red,<br/>And namely from the white wine of Lepe,<br/>That is to sell in Fish Street  and in Cheap.<br/>This wine of Spaine creepeth subtilly  --<br/>In other wines growing faste by,<br/>Of which there riseth such fumosity,<br/>That when a man hath drunken draughtes three,<br/>And weeneth that he be at home in Cheap,<br/>He is in Spain, right at the town of Lepe,<br/>Not at the Rochelle, nor at Bourdeaux town;<br/>And thenne will he say, Samsoun! Samsoun!<br/>But hearken, lordings, one word, I you pray,<br/>That all the sovreign actes, dare I say,<br/>Of victories in the Old Testament,<br/>Through very God that is omnipotent,<br/>Were done in abstinence and in prayere:<br/>Look in the Bible, and there ye may it lear.<br/>Look, Attila, the greate conqueror,<br/>Died in his sleep,  with shame and dishonour,<br/>Bleeding aye at his nose in drunkenness:<br/>A captain should aye live in soberness<br/>And o'er all this, advise you right well<br/>What was commanded unto Lemuel;<br/>Not Samuel, but Lemuel, say I.<br/>Reade the Bible, and find it expressly<br/>Of wine giving to them that have justice.<br/>No more of this, for it may well suffice.<br/><br/>And, now that I have spoke of gluttony,<br/>Now will I you defende hazardry.<br/>Hazard is very mother of leasings,<br/>And of deceit, and cursed forswearings:<br/>Blasphem' of Christ, manslaughter, and waste also<br/>Of chattel and of time; and furthermo'<br/>It is repreve, and contrar' of honour,<br/>For to be held a common hazardour.<br/>And ever the higher he is of estate,<br/>The more he is holden desolate.<br/>If that a prince use hazardry,<br/>In alle governance and policy<br/>He is, as by common opinion,<br/>Y-hold the less in reputation.<br/><br/>Chilon, that was a wise ambassador,<br/>Was sent to Corinth with full great honor<br/>From Lacedemon,  to make alliance;<br/>And when he came, it happen'd him, by chance,<br/>That all the greatest that were of that land,<br/>Y-playing atte hazard he them fand.<br/>For which, as soon as that it mighte be,<br/>He stole him home again to his country<br/>And saide there, "I will not lose my name,<br/>Nor will I take on me so great diffame,<br/>You to ally unto no hazardors.<br/>Sende some other wise ambassadors,<br/>For, by my troth, me were lever die,<br/>Than I should you to hazardors ally.<br/>For ye, that be so glorious in honours,<br/>Shall not ally you to no hazardours,<br/>As by my will, nor as by my treaty."<br/>This wise philosopher thus said he.<br/>Look eke how to the King Demetrius<br/>The King of Parthes, as the book saith us,<br/>Sent him a pair of dice of gold in scorn,<br/>For he had used hazard therebeforn:<br/>For which he held his glory and renown<br/>At no value or reputatioun.<br/>Lordes may finden other manner play<br/>Honest enough to drive the day away.<br/><br/>Now will I speak of oathes false and great<br/>A word or two, as olde bookes treat.<br/>Great swearing is a thing abominable,<br/>And false swearing is more reprovable.<br/>The highe God forbade swearing at all;<br/>Witness on Matthew:  but in special<br/>Of swearing saith the holy Jeremie,<br/>Thou thalt swear sooth thine oathes, and not lie:<br/>And swear in doom and eke in righteousness;<br/>But idle swearing is a cursedness.<br/>Behold and see, there in the firste table<br/>Of highe Godde's hestes honourable,<br/>How that the second best of him is this,<br/>Take not my name in idle or amiss.<br/>Lo, rather he forbiddeth such swearing,<br/>Than homicide, or many a cursed thing;<br/>I say that as by order thus it standeth;<br/>This knoweth he that his hests understandeth,<br/>How that the second hest of God is that.<br/>And farthermore, I will thee tell all plat,<br/>That vengeance shall not parte from his house,<br/>That of his oathes is outrageous.<br/>"By Godde's precious heart, and by his nails,<br/>And by the blood of Christ, that is in Hailes,<br/>Seven is my chance, and thine is cinque and trey:<br/>By Godde's armes, if thou falsely play,<br/>This dagger shall throughout thine hearte go."<br/>This fruit comes of the bicched bones two,<br/>Forswearing, ire, falseness, and homicide.<br/>Now, for the love of Christ that for us died,<br/>Leave your oathes, bothe great and smale.<br/>But, Sirs, now will I ell you forth my tale.<br/><br/>These riotoures three, of which I tell,<br/>Long erst than prime rang of any bell,<br/>Were set them in a tavern for to drink;<br/>And as they sat, they heard a belle clink<br/>Before a corpse, was carried to the grave.<br/>That one of them gan calle to his knave,<br/>"Go bet,"  quoth he, "and aske readily<br/>What corpse is this, that passeth here forth by;<br/>And look that thou report his name well."<br/>"Sir," quoth the boy, "it needeth never a deal;<br/>It was me told ere ye came here two hours;<br/>He was, pardie, an old fellow of yours,<br/>And suddenly he was y-slain to-night;<br/>Fordrunk as he sat on his bench upright,<br/>There came a privy thief, men clepe Death,<br/>That in this country all the people slay'th,<br/>And with his spear he smote his heart in two,<br/>And went his way withoute wordes mo'.<br/>He hath a thousand slain this pestilence;<br/>And, master, ere you come in his presence,<br/>Me thinketh that it were full necessary<br/>For to beware of such an adversary;<br/>Be ready for to meet him evermore.<br/>Thus taughte me my dame; I say no more."<br/>"By Sainte Mary," said the tavernere,<br/>"The child saith sooth, for he hath slain this year,<br/>Hence ov'r a mile, within a great village,<br/>Both man and woman, child, and hind, and page;<br/>I trow his habitation be there;<br/>To be advised great wisdom it were,<br/>Ere that he did a man a dishonour."<br/><br/>"Yea, Godde's armes," quoth this riotour,<br/>"Is it such peril with him for to meet?<br/>I shall him seek, by stile and eke by street.<br/>I make a vow, by Godde's digne bones."<br/>Hearken, fellows, we three be alle ones:<br/>Let each of us hold up his hand to other,<br/>And each of us become the other's brother,<br/>And we will slay this false traitor Death;<br/>He shall be slain, he that so many slay'th,<br/>By Godde's dignity, ere it be night."<br/>Together have these three their trothe plight<br/>To live and die each one of them for other<br/>As though he were his owen sworen brother.<br/>And up they start, all drunken, in this rage,<br/>And forth they go towardes that village<br/>Of which the taverner had spoke beforn,<br/>And many a grisly oathe have they sworn,<br/>And Christe's blessed body they to-rent;<br/>"Death shall be dead, if that we may him hent."<br/>When they had gone not fully half a mile,<br/>Right as they would have trodden o'er a stile,<br/>An old man and a poore with them met.<br/>This olde man full meekely them gret,<br/>And saide thus; "Now, lordes, God you see!"<br/>The proudest of these riotoures three<br/>Answer'd again; "What? churl, with sorry grace,<br/>Why art thou all forwrapped save thy face?<br/>Why livest thou so long in so great age?"<br/>This olde man gan look on his visage,<br/>And saide thus; "For that I cannot find<br/>A man, though that I walked unto Ind,<br/>Neither in city, nor in no village go,<br/>That woulde change his youthe for mine age;<br/>And therefore must I have mine age still<br/>As longe time as it is Godde's will.<br/>And Death, alas! he will not have my life.<br/>Thus walk I like a resteless caitife,<br/>And on the ground, which is my mother's gate,<br/>I knocke with my staff, early and late,<br/>And say to her, 'Leve mother, let me in.<br/>Lo, how I wane, flesh, and blood, and skin;<br/>Alas! when shall my bones be at rest?<br/>Mother, with you I woulde change my chest,<br/>That in my chamber longe time hath be,<br/>Yea, for an hairy clout to wrap in me.'<br/>But yet to me she will not do that grace,<br/>For which fall pale and welked is my face.<br/>But, Sirs, to you it is no courtesy<br/>To speak unto an old man villainy,<br/>But he trespass in word or else in deed.<br/>In Holy Writ ye may yourselves read;<br/>'Against an old man, hoar upon his head,<br/>Ye should arise:' therefore I you rede,<br/>Ne do unto an old man no harm now,<br/>No more than ye would a man did you<br/>In age, if that ye may so long abide.<br/>And God be with you, whether ye go or ride<br/>I must go thither as I have to go."<br/><br/>"Nay, olde churl, by God thou shalt not so,"<br/>Saide this other hazardor anon;<br/>"Thou partest not so lightly, by Saint John.<br/>Thou spakest right now of that traitor Death,<br/>That in this country all our friendes slay'th;<br/>Have here my troth, as thou art his espy;<br/>Tell where he is, or thou shalt it abie,<br/>By God and by the holy sacrament;<br/>For soothly thou art one of his assent<br/>To slay us younge folk, thou false thief."<br/>"Now, Sirs," quoth he, "if it be you so lief<br/>To finde Death, turn up this crooked way,<br/>For in that grove I left him, by my fay,<br/>Under a tree, and there he will abide;<br/>Nor for your boast he will him nothing hide.<br/>See ye that oak? right there ye shall him find.<br/>God save you, that bought again mankind,<br/>And you amend!" Thus said this olde man;<br/>And evereach of these riotoures ran,<br/>Till they came to the tree, and there they found<br/>Of florins fine, of gold y-coined round,<br/>Well nigh a seven bushels, as them thought.<br/>No longer as then after Death they sought;<br/>But each of them so glad was of the sight,<br/>For that the florins were so fair and bright,<br/>That down they sat them by the precious hoard.<br/>The youngest of them spake the firste word:<br/>"Brethren," quoth he, "take keep what I shall say;<br/>My wit is great, though that I bourde and play<br/>This treasure hath Fortune unto us given<br/>In mirth and jollity our life to liven;<br/>And lightly as it comes, so will we spend.<br/>Hey! Godde's precious dignity! who wend<br/>Today that we should have so fair a grace?<br/>But might this gold he carried from this place<br/>Home to my house, or elles unto yours<br/>(For well I wot that all this gold is ours),<br/>Then were we in high felicity.<br/>But truely by day it may not be;<br/>Men woulde say that we were thieves strong,<br/>And for our owen treasure do us hong.<br/>This treasure muste carried be by night,<br/>As wisely and as slily as it might.<br/>Wherefore I rede, that cut among us all<br/>We draw, and let see where the cut will fall:<br/>And he that hath the cut, with hearte blithe<br/>Shall run unto the town, and that full swithe,<br/>And bring us bread and wine full privily:<br/>And two of us shall keepe subtilly<br/>This treasure well: and if he will not tarry,<br/>When it is night, we will this treasure carry,<br/>By one assent, where as us thinketh best."<br/>Then one of them the cut brought in his fist,<br/>And bade them draw, and look where it would fall;<br/>And it fell on the youngest of them all;<br/>And forth toward the town he went anon.<br/>And all so soon as  that he was y-gone,<br/>The one of them spake thus unto the other;<br/>"Thou knowest well that thou art my sworn brother,<br/>Thy profit will I tell thee right anon.<br/>Thou knowest well that our fellow is gone,<br/>And here is gold, and that full great plenty,<br/>That shall departed he among us three.<br/>But natheless, if I could shape it so<br/>That it departed were among us two,<br/>Had I not done a friende's turn to thee?"<br/>Th' other answer'd, "I n'ot how that may be;<br/>He knows well that the gold is with us tway.<br/>What shall we do? what shall we to him say?"<br/>"Shall it be counsel?" said the firste shrew;<br/>"And I shall tell to thee in wordes few<br/>What we shall do, and bring it well about."<br/>"I grante," quoth the other, "out of doubt,<br/>That by my truth I will thee not bewray."<br/>"Now," quoth the first, "thou know'st well we be tway,<br/>And two of us shall stronger be than one.<br/>Look; when that he is set, thou right anon<br/>Arise, as though thou wouldest with him play;<br/>And I shall rive him through the sides tway,<br/>While that thou strugglest with him as in game;<br/>And with thy dagger look thou do the same.<br/>And then shall all this gold departed be,<br/>My deare friend, betwixte thee and me:<br/>Then may we both our lustes all fulfil,<br/>And play at dice right at our owen will."<br/>And thus accorded be these shrewes tway<br/>To slay the third, as ye have heard me say.<br/><br/>The youngest, which that wente to the town,<br/>Full oft in heart he rolled up and down<br/>The beauty of these florins new and bright.<br/>"O Lord!" quoth he, "if so were that I might<br/>Have all this treasure to myself alone,<br/>There is no man that lives under the throne<br/>Of God, that shoulde have so merry as I."<br/>And at the last the fiend our enemy<br/>Put in his thought, that he should poison buy,<br/>With which he mighte slay his fellows twy.<br/>For why, the fiend found him in such living,<br/>That he had leave to sorrow him to bring.<br/>For this was utterly his full intent<br/>To slay them both, and never to repent.<br/>And forth he went, no longer would he tarry,<br/>Into the town to an apothecary,<br/>And prayed him that he him woulde sell<br/>Some poison, that he might his rattes quell,<br/>And eke there was a polecat in his haw,<br/>That, as he said, his eapons had y-slaw:<br/>And fain he would him wreak, if that he might,<br/>Of vermin that destroyed him by night.<br/>Th'apothecary answer'd, "Thou shalt have<br/>A thing, as wisly God my soule save,<br/>In all this world there is no creature<br/>That eat or drank hath of this confecture,<br/>Not but the mountance of a corn of wheat,<br/>That he shall not his life anon forlete;<br/>Yea, sterve he shall, and that in lesse while<br/>Than thou wilt go apace nought but a mile:<br/>This poison is so strong and violent."<br/>This cursed man hath in his hand y-hent<br/>This poison in a box, and swift he ran<br/>Into the nexte street, unto a man,<br/>And borrow'd of him large bottles three;<br/>And in the two the poison poured he;<br/>The third he kepte clean for his own drink,<br/>For all the night he shope him for to swink<br/>In carrying off the gold out of that place.<br/>And when this riotour, with sorry grace,<br/>Had fill'd with wine his greate bottles three,<br/><br/>To his fellows again repaired he.<br/>What needeth it thereof to sermon more?<br/>For, right as they had cast his death before,<br/>Right so they have him slain, and that anon.<br/>And when that this was done, thus spake the one;<br/>"Now let us sit and drink, and make us merry,<br/>And afterward we will his body bury."<br/>And with that word it happen'd him par cas<br/>To take the bottle where the poison was,<br/>And drank, and gave his fellow drink also,<br/>For which anon they sterved both the two.<br/>But certes I suppose that Avicen<br/>Wrote never in no canon, nor no fen,<br/>More wondrous signes of empoisoning,<br/>Than had these wretches two ere their ending.<br/>Thus ended be these homicides two,<br/>And eke the false empoisoner also.<br/><br/>O cursed sin, full of all cursedness!<br/>O trait'rous homicide! O wickedness!<br/>O glutt'ny, luxury, and hazardry!<br/>Thou blasphemer of Christ with villany,<br/>And oathes great, of usage and of pride!<br/>Alas! mankinde, how may it betide,<br/>That to thy Creator, which that thee wrought,<br/>And with his precious hearte-blood thee bought,<br/>Thou art so false and so unkind, alas!<br/>Now, good men, God forgive you your trespass,<br/>And ware you from the sin of avarice.<br/>Mine holy pardon may you all warice,<br/>So that ye offer nobles or sterlings,<br/>Or elles silver brooches, spoons, or rings.<br/>Bowe your head under this holy bull.<br/>Come up, ye wives, and offer of your will;<br/>Your names I enter in my roll anon;<br/>Into the bliss of heaven shall ye gon;<br/>I you assoil by mine high powere,<br/>You that will offer, as clean and eke as clear<br/>As ye were born. Lo, Sires, thus I preach;<br/>And Jesus Christ, that is our soules' leech,<br/>So grante you his pardon to receive;<br/>For that is best, I will not deceive.<br/><br/>But, Sirs, one word forgot I in my tale;<br/>I have relics and pardon in my mail,<br/>As fair as any man in Engleland,<br/>Which were me given by the Pope's hand.<br/>If any of you will of devotion<br/>Offer, and have mine absolution,<br/>Come forth anon, and kneele here adown<br/>And meekely receive my pardoun.<br/>Or elles take pardon, as ye wend,<br/>All new and fresh at every towne's end,<br/>So that ye offer, always new and new,<br/>Nobles or pence which that be good and true.<br/>'Tis an honour to evereach that is here,<br/>That ye have a suffisant pardonere<br/>T'assoile you in country as ye ride,<br/>For aventures which that may betide.<br/>Paraventure there may fall one or two<br/>Down of his horse, and break his neck in two.<br/>Look, what a surety is it to you all,<br/>That I am in your fellowship y-fall,<br/>That may assoil you bothe more and lass,<br/>When that the soul shall from the body pass.<br/>I rede that our Hoste shall begin,<br/>For he is most enveloped in sin.<br/>Come forth, Sir Host, and offer first anon,<br/>And thou shalt kiss; the relics every one,<br/>Yea, for a groat; unbuckle anon thy purse.<br/><br/>"Nay, nay," quoth he, "then have I Christe's curse!<br/>Let be," quoth he, "it shall not be, so the'ch.<br/>Thou wouldest make me kiss thine olde breech,<br/>And swear it were a relic of a saint,<br/>Though it were with thy fundament depaint'.<br/>But, by the cross which that Saint Helen fand,<br/>I would I had thy coilons in mine hand,<br/>Instead of relics, or of sanctuary.<br/>Let cut them off, I will thee help them carry;<br/>They shall be shrined in a hogge's turd."<br/>The Pardoner answered not one word;<br/>So wroth he was, no worde would he say.<br/><br/>"Now," quoth our Host, "I will no longer play<br/>With thee, nor with none other angry man."<br/>But right anon the worthy Knight began<br/>(When that he saw that all the people lough),<br/>"No more of this, for it is right enough.<br/>Sir Pardoner, be merry and glad of cheer;<br/>And ye, Sir Host, that be to me so dear,<br/>I pray you that ye kiss the Pardoner;<br/>And, Pardoner, I pray thee draw thee ner,<br/>And as we didde, let us laugh and play."<br/>Anon they kiss'd, and rode forth their way.
