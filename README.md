  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ An Old Song by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    I WAS not apprenticed nor ever dwelt in famous<br/>     Lincolnshire;<br/>I've served one master ill and well much more than<br/>     seven year;<br/>And never took up to poaching as you shall quickly<br/>     find;<br/>  But 'tis my delight of a shiny night in the season<br/>     of the year.<br/><br/>I roamed where nobody had a right but keepers and<br/>     squires, and there<br/>I sought for nests, wild flowers, oak sticks, and<br/>     moles, both far and near.<br/>And had to run from farmers, and learnt the<br/>     Lincolnshire song:<br/>    "Oh, 'tis my delight of a shiny night in the<br/>     season of the year."<br/><br/>I took those walks years after, talking with friend<br/>     or dear,<br/>Or solitary musing; but when the moon shone clear<br/>I had no joy or sorrow that could not be expressed<br/>By "'Tis my delight of a shiny night in the<br/>     season of the year."<br/><br/>Since then I've thrown away a chance to fight a<br/>     gamekeeper;<br/>And I less often trespass, and what I see or hear<br/>Is mostly from the road or path by day: yet still<br/>     I sing:<br/>    "Oh, 'tis my delight of a shiny night in the<br/>     season of the year."<br/><br/>For if I am contented, at home or anywhere,<br/>Or if I sigh for I know not what, or my heart<br/>     beats with some fear,<br/>It is a strange kind of delight to sing or whistle just:<br/>    "Oh, 'tis my delight of a shiny night in the<br/>     season of the year."<br/><br/>And with this melody on my lips and no one by to<br/>     care,<br/>Indoors, or out on shiny nights or dark in open air,<br/>I am for a moment made a man that sings out of<br/>     his heart:<br/>    "Oh, 'tis my delight of a shiny night in the<br/>     season of the year."
