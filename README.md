# üíÆ Night by *William Blake*

<p>
    The sun descending in the west,<br/>The evening star does shine;<br/>The birds are silent in their nest,<br/>And I must seek for mine.<br/>  The moon, like a flower<br/>  In heaven's high bower,<br/>  With silent delight,<br/>  Sits and smiles on the night.<br/><br/>Farewell, green fields and happy grove,<br/>Where flocks have ta'en delight.<br/>Where lambs have nibbled, silent move<br/>The feet of angels bright;<br/>  Unseen they pour blessing,<br/>  And joy without ceasing,<br/>  On each bud and blossom,<br/>  And each sleeping bosom.<br/><br/>They look in every thoughtless nest<br/>Where birds are covered warm;<br/>They visit caves of every beast,<br/>To keep them all from harm:<br/>  If they see any weeping<br/>  That should have been sleeping,<br/>  They pour sleep on their head,<br/>  And sit down by their bed.<br/><br/>When wolves and tigers howl for prey,<br/>They pitying stand and weep;<br/>Seeking to drive their thirst away,<br/>And keep them from the sheep.<br/>  But, if they rush dreadful,<br/>  The angels, most heedful,<br/>  Receive each mild spirit,<br/>  New worlds to inherit.<br/><br/>And there the lion's ruddy eyes<br/>Shall flow with tears of gold:<br/>And pitying the tender cries,<br/>And walking round the fold:<br/>  Saying: "Wrath by His meekness,<br/>  And, by His health, sickness,<br/>  Are driven away<br/>  From our immortal day.<br/><br/>"And now beside thee, bleating lamb,<br/>I can lie down and sleep,<br/>Or think on Him who bore thy name,<br/>Graze after thee, and weep.<br/>  For, washed in life's river,<br/>  My bright mane for ever<br/>  Shall shine like the gold,<br/>  As I guard o'er the fold."
