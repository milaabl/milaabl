# 💮 On my Sister Joanna's Entrance into Her 33rd Year by *Major Henry Livingston, Jr.*

<p>
    On this thy natal day permit a friend -<br/>A brother - with thy joys his own to blend:<br/>In all gladness he would wish to share<br/>As willing in thy griefs a part to bear.<br/><br/>Meekly attend the ways of higher heav'n!<br/>Is much deny'd? Yet much my dear is giv'n.<br/>Thy health, thy reason unimpaired remain<br/>And while as new fal'n snows thy spotless fame<br/>The partner of thy life, attentive - kind -<br/>And blending e'en the interests of the mind.<br/><br/>What bliss is thine when fore thy glistring eye<br/>Thy lovely infant train pass jocund by!<br/>The ruddy cheek, the smiling morning face<br/>Denote a healthy undegenerate race:<br/>In them renew'd, you'll live and live again,<br/>And children's children's children lisp thy name.<br/>Bright be the skies where'er my sister goes<br/>Nor scowling tempests injure her repose -<br/>The field of life with roses thick be strow'd<br/>Nor one sharp thorn lie lurking in the road.<br/>Thy ev'ry path be still a path of peace<br/>And each revolving year thy joys increase;<br/>Till hours and years of time itself be o'er<br/>And one eternal day around thee pour.
</p>
