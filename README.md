# üíÆ The Corsair.   by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>"----nessun maggior dolore,<br/>Che ricordarsi del tempo felice<br/>Nella miseria,----"<br/>                         Dante, _Inferno_, v. 121.<br/><br/>"O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,<br/>Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,<br/>Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,<br/>Survey our empire, and behold our home!<br/>These are our realms, no limits to their sway--<br/>Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.<br/>Ours the wild life in tumult still to range<br/>From toil to rest, and joy in every change.<br/>Oh, who can tell? not thou, luxurious slave!<br/>Whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave;<br/>Not thou, vain lord of Wantonness and Ease!<br/>Whom Slumber soothes not--Pleasure cannot please--<br/>Oh, who can tell, save he whose heart hath tried,<br/>And danced in triumph o'er the waters wide,<br/>The exulting sense--the pulse's maddening play,<br/>That thrills the wanderer of that trackless way?<br/>That for itself can woo the approaching fight,<br/>And turn what some deem danger to delight;<br/>That seeks what cravens shun with more than zeal,<br/>And where the feebler faint can only feel--<br/>Feel--to the rising bosom's inmost core,<br/>Its hope awaken and its spirit soar?<br/>No dread of Death--if with us die our foes--<br/>Save that it seems even duller than repose;<br/>Come when it will--we snatch the life of Life--<br/>When lost--what recks it by disease or strife?<br/>Let him who crawls, enamoured of decay,<br/>Cling to his couch, and sicken years away;<br/>Heave his thick breath, and shake his palsied head;<br/>Ours the fresh turf, and not the feverish bed,--<br/>While gasp by gasp he falters forth his soul,<br/>Ours with one pang--one bound--escapes control.<br/>His corse may boast its urn and narrow cave,<br/>And they who loathed his life may gild his grave:<br/>Ours are the tears, though few, sincerely shed,<br/>When Ocean shrouds and sepulchres our dead.<br/>For us, even banquets fond regret supply<br/>In the red cup that crowns our memory;<br/>And the brief epitaph in Danger's day,<br/>When those who win at length divide the prey,<br/>And cry, Remembrance saddening o'er each brow,<br/>How had the brave who fell exulted _now_!"<br/><br/>Such were the notes that from the Pirate's isle<br/>Around the kindling watch-fire rang the while:<br/>Such were the sounds that thrilled the rocks along,<br/>And unto ears as rugged seemed a song!<br/>In scattered groups upon the golden sand,<br/>They game--carouse--converse--or whet the brand;<br/>Select the arms--to each his blade assign,<br/>And careless eye the blood that dims its shine;<br/>Repair the boat, replace the helm or oar,<br/>While others straggling muse along the shore;<br/>For the wild bird the busy springes set,<br/>Or spread beneath the sun the dripping net:<br/>Gaze where some distant sail a speck supplies,<br/>With all the thirsting eye of Enterprise;<br/>Tell o'er the tales of many a night of toil,<br/>And marvel where they next shall seize a spoil:<br/>No matter where--their chief's allotment this;<br/>Theirs to believe no prey nor plan amiss.<br/>But who that Chief? his name on every shore<br/>Is famed and feared--they ask and know no more<br/>With these he mingles not but to command;<br/>Few are his words, but keen his eye and hand.<br/>Ne'er seasons he with mirth their jovial mess,<br/>But they forgive his silence for success.<br/>Ne'er for his lip the purpling cup they fill,<br/>That goblet passes him untasted still--<br/>And for his fare--the rudest of his crew<br/>Would that, in turn, have passed untasted too;<br/>Earth's coarsest bread, the garden's homeliest roots,<br/>And scarce the summer luxury of fruits,<br/>His short repast in humbleness supply<br/>With all a hermit's board would scarce deny.<br/>But while he shuns the grosser joys of sense,<br/>His mind seems nourished by that abstinence.<br/>"Steer to that shore!"--they sail. "Do this!"--'tis done:<br/>"Now form and follow me!"--the spoil is won.<br/>Thus prompt his accents and his actions still,<br/>And all obey and few inquire his will;<br/>To such, brief answer and contemptuous eye<br/>Convey reproof, nor further deign reply.<br/><br/>"A sail!--a sail!"--a promised prize to Hope!<br/>Her nation--flag--how speaks the telescope?<br/>No prize, alas! but yet a welcome sail:<br/>The blood-red signal glitters in the gale.<br/>Yes--she is ours--a home-returning bark--<br/>Blow fair, thou breeze!--she anchors ere the dark.<br/>Already doubled is the cape--our bay<br/>Receives that prow which proudly spurns the spray.<br/>How gloriously her gallant course she goes!<br/>Her white wings flying--never from her foes--<br/>She walks the waters like a thing of Life!<br/>And seems to dare the elements to strife.<br/>Who would not brave the battle-fire, the wreck,<br/>To move the monarch of her peopled deck!<br/><br/>Hoarse o'er her side the rustling cable rings:<br/>The sails are furled; and anchoring round she swings;<br/>And gathering loiterers on the land discern<br/>Her boat descending from the latticed stern.<br/>'Tis manned--the oars keep concert to the strand,<br/>Till grates her keel upon the shallow sand.<br/>Hail to the welcome shout!--the friendly speech!<br/>When hand grasps hand uniting on the beach;<br/>The smile, the question, and the quick reply,<br/>And the Heart's promise of festivity!<br/><br/>The tidings spread, and gathering grows the crowd:<br/>The hum of voices, and the laughter loud,<br/>And Woman's gentler anxious tone is heard--<br/>Friends'--husbands'--lovers' names in each dear word:<br/>"Oh! are they safe? we ask not of success--<br/>But shall we see them? will their accents bless?<br/>From where the battle roars, the billows chafe,<br/>They doubtless boldly did--but who are safe?<br/>Here let them haste to gladden and surprise,<br/>And kiss the doubt from these delighted eyes!"<br/><br/>"Where is our Chief? for him we bear report--<br/>And doubt that joy--which hails our coming--short;<br/>Yet thus sincere--'tis cheering, though so brief;<br/>But, Juan! instant guide us to our Chief:<br/>Our greeting paid, we'll feast on our return,<br/>And all shall hear what each may wish to learn."<br/>Ascending slowly by the rock-hewn way,<br/>To where his watch-tower beetles o'er the bay,<br/>By bushy brake, the wild flowers blossoming,<br/>And freshness breathing from each silver spring,<br/>Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,<br/>Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst;<br/>From crag to cliff they mount--Near yonder cave,<br/>What lonely straggler looks along the wave?<br/>In pensive posture leaning on the brand,<br/>Not oft a resting-staff to that red hand?<br/>"'Tis he--'tis Conrad--here--as wont--alone;<br/>On--Juan!--on--and make our purpose known.<br/>The bark he views--and tell him we would greet<br/>His ear with tidings he must quickly meet:<br/>We dare not yet approach--thou know'st his mood,<br/>When strange or uninvited steps intrude."<br/><br/>Him Juan sought, and told of their intent;--<br/>He spake not, but a sign expressed assent,<br/>These Juan calls--they come--to their salute<br/>He bends him slightly, but his lips are mute.<br/>"These letters, Chief, are from the Greek--the spy,<br/>Who still proclaims our spoil or peril nigh:<br/>Whate'er his tidings, we can well report,<br/>Much that"--"Peace, peace!"--he cuts their prating short.<br/>Wondering they turn, abashed, while each to each<br/>Conjecture whispers in his muttering speech:<br/>They watch his glance with many a stealing look,<br/>To gather how that eye the tidings took;<br/>But, this as if he guessed, with head aside,<br/>Perchance from some emotion, doubt, or pride,<br/>He read the scroll--"My tablets, Juan, hark--<br/>Where is Gonsalvo?"<br/><br/> "In the anchored bark."<br/>"There let him stay--to him this order bear--<br/>Back to your duty--for my course prepare:<br/>Myself this enterprise to-night will share."<br/>"To-night, Lord Conrad?"<br/>     "Aye! at set of sun:<br/>The breeze will freshen when the day is done.<br/>My corslet--cloak--one hour and we are gone.<br/>Sling on thy bugle--see that free from rust<br/>My carbine-lock springs worthy of my trust;<br/>Be the edge sharpened of my boarding-brand,<br/>And give its guard more room to fit my hand.<br/>This let the Armourer with speed dispose;<br/>Last time, it more fatigued my arm than foes;<br/>Mark that the signal-gun be duly fired,<br/>To tell us when the hour of stay's expired."<br/><br/>They make obeisance, and retire in haste,<br/>Too soon to seek again the watery waste:<br/>Yet they repine not--so that Conrad guides;<br/>And who dare question aught that he decides?<br/>That man of loneliness and mystery,<br/>Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh;<br/>Whose name appals the fiercest of his crew,<br/>And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue;<br/>Still sways their souls with that commanding art<br/>That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart.<br/>What is that spell, that thus his lawless train<br/>Confess and envy--yet oppose in vain?<br/>What should it be, that thus their faith can bind?<br/>The power of Thought--the magic of the Mind!<br/>Linked with success, assumed and kept with skill,<br/>That moulds another's weakness to its will;<br/>Wields with their hands, but, still to these unknown,<br/>Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own.<br/>Such hath it been--shall be--beneath the Sun<br/>The many still must labour for the one!<br/>'Tis Nature's doom--but let the wretch who toils,<br/>Accuse not--hate not--_him_ who wears the spoils.<br/>Oh! if he knew the weight of splendid chains,<br/>How light the balance of his humbler pains!<br/><br/>Unlike the heroes of each ancient race,<br/>Demons in act, but Gods at least in face,<br/>In Conrad's form seems little to admire,<br/>Though his dark eyebrow shades a glance of fire:<br/>Robust but not Herculean--to the sight<br/>No giant frame sets forth his common height;<br/>Yet, in the whole, who paused to look again,<br/>Saw more than marks the crowd of vulgar men;<br/>They gaze and marvel how--and still confess<br/>That thus it is, but why they cannot guess.<br/>Sun-burnt his cheek, his forehead high and pale<br/>The sable curls in wild profusion veil;<br/>And oft perforce his rising lip reveals<br/>The haughtier thought it curbs, but scarce conceals.<br/>Though smooth his voice, and calm his general mien,<br/>Still seems there something he would not have seen:<br/>His features' deepening lines and varying hue<br/>At times attracted, yet perplexed the view,<br/>As if within that murkiness of mind<br/>Worked feelings fearful, and yet undefined;<br/>Such might it be--that none could truly tell--<br/>Too close inquiry his stern glance would quell.<br/>There breathe but few whose aspect might defy<br/>The full encounter of his searching eye;<br/>He had the skill, when Cunning's gaze would seek<br/>To probe his heart and watch his changing cheek,<br/>At once the observer's purpose to espy,<br/>And on himself roll back his scrutiny,<br/>Lest he to Conrad rather should betray<br/>Some secret thought, than drag that Chief's to day.<br/>There was a laughing Devil in his sneer,<br/>That raised emotions both of rage and fear;<br/>And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,<br/>Hope withering fled--and Mercy sighed farewell!<br/><br/>Slight are the outward signs of evil thought,<br/>Within--within--'twas there the spirit wrought!<br/>Love shows all changes--Hate, Ambition, Guile,<br/>Betray no further than the bitter smile;<br/>The lip's least curl, the lightest paleness thrown<br/>Along the governed aspect, speak alone<br/>Of deeper passions; and to judge their mien,<br/>He, who would see, must be himself unseen.<br/>Then--with the hurried tread, the upward eye,<br/>The clench√©d hand, the pause of agony,<br/>That listens, starting, lest the step too near<br/>Approach intrusive on that mood of fear:<br/>Then--with each feature working from the heart,<br/>With feelings, loosed to strengthen--not depart,<br/>That rise--convulse--contend--that freeze or glow,<br/>Flush in the cheek, or damp upon the brow;<br/>Then--Stranger! if thou canst, and tremblest not,<br/>Behold his soul--the rest that soothes his lot!<br/>Mark how that lone and blighted bosom sears<br/>The scathing thought of execrated years!<br/>Behold--but who hath seen, or e'er shall see,<br/>Man as himself--the secret spirit free?<br/><br/>Yet was not Conrad thus by Nature sent<br/>To lead the guilty--Guilt's worse instrument--<br/>His soul was changed, before his deeds had driven<br/>Him forth to war with Man and forfeit Heaven.<br/>Warped by the world in Disappointment's school,<br/>In words too wise--in conduct _there_ a fool;<br/>Too firm to yield, and far too proud to stoop,<br/>Doomed by his very virtues for a dupe,<br/>He cursed those virtues as the cause of ill,<br/>And not the traitors who betrayed him still;<br/>Nor deemed that gifts bestowed on better men<br/>Had left him joy, and means to give again.<br/>Feared--shunned--belied--ere Youth had lost her force,<br/>He hated Man too much to feel remorse,<br/>And thought the voice of Wrath a sacred call,<br/>To pay the injuries of some on all.<br/>He knew himself a villain--but he deemed<br/>The rest no better than the thing he seemed;<br/>And scorned the best as hypocrites who hid<br/>Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.<br/>He knew himself detested, but he knew<br/>The hearts that loathed him, crouched and dreaded too.<br/>Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt<br/>From all affection and from all contempt:<br/>His name could sadden, and his acts surprise;<br/>But they that feared him dared not to despise:<br/>Man spurns the worm, but pauses ere he wake<br/>The slumbering venom of the folded snake:<br/>The first may turn, but not avenge the blow;<br/>The last expires, but leaves no living foe;<br/>Fast to the doomed offender's form it clings,<br/>And he may crush--not conquer--still it stings!<br/><br/>None are all evil--quickening round his heart,<br/>One softer feeling would not yet depart;<br/>Oft could he sneer at others as beguiled<br/>By passions worthy of a fool or child;<br/>Yet 'gainst that passion vainly still he strove,<br/>And even in him it asks the name of Love!<br/>Yes, it was love--unchangeable--unchanged,<br/>Felt but for one from whom he never ranged;<br/>Though fairest captives daily met his eye,<br/>He shunned, nor sought, but coldly passed them by;<br/>Though many a beauty drooped in prisoned bower,<br/>None ever soothed his most unguarded hour,<br/>Yes--it was Love--if thoughts of tenderness,<br/>Tried in temptation, strengthened by distress,<br/>Unmoved by absence, firm in every clime,<br/>And yet--Oh more than all!--untired by Time;<br/>Which nor defeated hope, nor baffled wile,<br/>Could render sullen were She near to smile,<br/>Nor rage could fire, nor sickness fret to vent<br/>On her one murmur of his discontent;<br/>Which still would meet with joy, with calmness part,<br/>Lest that his look of grief should reach her heart;<br/>Which nought removed, nor menaced to remove--<br/>If there be Love in mortals--this was Love!<br/>He was a villain--aye, reproaches shower<br/>On him--but not the Passion, nor its power,<br/>Which only proved--all other virtues gone--<br/>Not Guilt itself could quench this loveliest one!<br/><br/>He paused a moment--till his hastening men<br/>Passed the first winding downward to the glen.<br/>"Strange tidings!--many a peril have I passed,<br/>Nor know I why this next appears the last!<br/>Yet so my heart forebodes, but must not fear,<br/>Nor shall my followers find me falter here.<br/>'Tis rash to meet--but surer death to wait<br/>Till here they hunt us to undoubted fate;<br/>And, if my plan but hold, and Fortune smile,<br/>We'll furnish mourners for our funeral pile.<br/>Aye, let them slumber--peaceful be their dreams!<br/>Morn ne'er awoke them with such brilliant beams<br/>As kindle high to-night (but blow, thou breeze!)<br/>To warm these slow avengers of the seas.<br/>Now to Medora--Oh! my sinking heart,<br/>Long may her own be lighter than thou art!<br/>Yet was I brave--mean boast where all are brave!<br/>Ev'n insects sting for aught they seek to save.<br/>This common courage which with brutes we share,<br/>That owes its deadliest efforts to Despair,<br/>Small merit claims--but 'twas my nobler hope<br/>To teach my few with numbers still to cope;<br/>Long have I led them--not to vainly bleed:<br/>No medium now--we perish or succeed!<br/>So let it be--it irks not me to die;<br/>But thus to urge them whence they cannot fly.<br/>My lot hath long had little of my care,<br/>But chafes my pride thus baffled in the snare:<br/>Is this my skill? my craft? to set at last<br/>Hope, Power and Life upon a single cast?<br/>Oh, Fate!--accuse thy folly--not thy fate;<br/>She may redeem thee still--nor yet too late."<br/><br/>Thus with himself communion held he, till<br/>He reached the summit of his tower-crowned hill:<br/>There at the portal paused--for wild and soft<br/>He heard those accents never heard too oft!<br/>Through the high lattice far yet sweet they rung,<br/>And these the notes his Bird of Beauty sung:<br/><br/>"Deep in my soul that tender secret dwells,<br/>  Lonely and lost to light for evermore,<br/>Save when to thine my heart responsive swells,<br/>  Then trembles into silence as before.<br/><br/>"There, in its centre, a sepulchral lamp<br/>  Burns the slow flame, eternal--but unseen;<br/>Which not the darkness of Despair can damp,<br/>  Though vain its ray as it had never been.<br/><br/>"Remember me--Oh! pass not thou my grave<br/>  Without one thought whose relics there recline:<br/>The only pang my bosom dare not brave<br/>  Must be to find forgetfulness in thine.<br/><br/>"My fondest--faintest--latest accents hear--<br/>  Grief for the dead not Virtue can reprove;<br/>Then give me all I ever asked--a tear,<br/>  The first--last--sole reward of so much love!"<br/><br/>He passed the portal, crossed the corridor,<br/>And reached the chamber as the strain gave o'er:<br/>"My own Medora! sure thy song is sad--"<br/><br/>"In Conrad's absence would'st thou have it glad?<br/>Without thine ear to listen to my lay,<br/>Still must my song my thoughts, my soul betray:<br/>Still must each accent to my bosom suit,<br/>My heart unhushed--although my lips were mute!<br/>Oh! many a night on this lone couch reclined,<br/>My dreaming fear with storms hath winged the wind,<br/>And deemed the breath that faintly fanned thy sail<br/>The murmuring prelude of the ruder gale;<br/>Though soft--it seemed the low prophetic dirge,<br/>That mourned thee floating on the savage surge:<br/>Still would I rise to rouse the beacon fire,<br/>Lest spies less true should let the blaze expire;<br/>And many a restless hour outwatched each star,<br/>And morning came--and still thou wert afar.<br/>Oh! how the chill blast on my bosom blew,<br/>And day broke dreary on my troubled view,<br/>And still I gazed and gazed--and not a prow<br/>Was granted to my tears--my truth--my vow!<br/>At length--'twas noon--I hailed and blest the mast<br/>That met my sight--it neared--Alas! it passed!<br/>Another came--Oh God! 'twas thine at last!<br/>Would that those days were over! wilt thou ne'er,<br/>My Conrad! learn the joys of peace to share?<br/>Sure thou hast more than wealth, and many a home<br/>As bright as this invites us not to roam:<br/>Thou know'st it is not peril that I fear,<br/>I only tremble when thou art not here;<br/>Then not for mine, but that far dearer life,<br/>Which flies from love and languishes for strife--<br/>How strange that heart, to me so tender still,<br/>Should war with Nature and its better will!"<br/><br/>"Yea, strange indeed--that heart hath long been changed;<br/>Worm-like 'twas trampled--adder-like avenged--<br/>Without one hope on earth beyond thy love,<br/>And scarce a glimpse of mercy from above.<br/>Yet the same feeling which thou dost condemn,<br/>My very love to thee is hate to them,<br/>So closely mingling here, that disentwined,<br/>I cease to love thee when I love Mankind:<br/>Yet dread not this--the proof of all the past<br/>Assures the future that my love will last;<br/>But--Oh, Medora! nerve thy gentler heart;<br/>This hour again--but not for long--we part."<br/><br/>"This hour we part!--my heart foreboded this:<br/>Thus ever fade my fairy dreams of bliss.<br/>This hour--it cannot be--this hour away!<br/>Yon bark hath hardly anchored in the bay:<br/>Her consort still is absent, and her crew<br/>Have need of rest before they toil anew;<br/>My Love! thou mock'st my weakness; and wouldst steel<br/>My breast before the time when it must feel;<br/>But trifle now no more with my distress,<br/>Such mirth hath less of play than bitterness.<br/>Be silent, Conrad!--dearest! come and share<br/>The feast these hands delighted to prepare;<br/>Light toil! to cull and dress thy frugal fare!<br/>See, I have plucked the fruit that promised best,<br/>And where not sure, perplexed, but pleased, I guessed<br/>At such as seemed the fairest; thrice the hill<br/>My steps have wound to try the coolest rill;<br/>Yes! thy Sherbet to-night will sweetly flow,<br/>See how it sparkles in its vase of snow!<br/>The grapes' gay juice thy bosom never cheers;<br/>Thou more than Moslem when the cup appears:<br/>Think not I mean to chide--for I rejoice<br/>What others deem a penance is thy choice.<br/>But come, the board is spread; our silver lamp<br/>Is trimmed, and heeds not the Sirocco's damp:<br/>Then shall my handmaids while the time along,<br/>And join with me the dance, or wake the song;<br/>Or my guitar, which still thou lov'st to hear,<br/>Shall soothe or lull--or, should it vex thine ear,<br/>We'll turn the tale, by Ariosto told,<br/>Of fair Olympia loved and left of old.<br/>Why, thou wert worse than he who broke his vow<br/>To that lost damsel, should thou leave me _now_--<br/>Or even that traitor chief--I've seen thee smile,<br/>When the clear sky showed Ariadne's Isle,<br/>Which I have pointed from these cliffs the while:<br/>And thus half sportive--half in fear--I said,<br/>Lest Time should raise that doubt to more than dread,<br/>Thus Conrad, too, will quit me for the main:<br/>And he deceived me--for--he came again!"<br/><br/>"Again, again--and oft again--my Love!<br/>If there be life below, and hope above,<br/>He will return--but now, the moments bring<br/>The time of parting with redoubled wing:<br/>The why, the where--what boots it now to tell?<br/>Since all must end in that wild word--Farewell!<br/>Yet would I fain--did time allow--disclose--<br/>Fear not--these are no formidable foes!<br/>And here shall watch a more than wonted guard,<br/>For sudden siege and long defence prepared:<br/>Nor be thou lonely, though thy Lord's away,<br/>Our matrons and thy handmaids with thee stay;<br/>And this thy comfort--that, when next we meet,<br/>Security shall make repose more sweet.<br/>List!--'tis the bugle!"--Juan shrilly blew--<br/>"One kiss--one more--another--Oh! Adieu!"<br/>She rose--she sprung--she clung to his embrace,<br/>Till his heart heaved beneath her hidden face:<br/>He dared not raise to his that deep-blue eye,<br/>Which downcast drooped in tearless agony.<br/>Her long fair hair lay floating o'er his arms,<br/>In all the wildness of dishevelled charms;<br/>Scarce beat that bosom where his image dwelt<br/>So full--_that_ feeling seem'd almost unfelt!<br/>Hark--peals the thunder of the signal-gun!<br/>It told 'twas sunset, and he cursed that sun.<br/>Again--again--that form he madly pressed,<br/>Which mutely clasped, imploringly caressed!<br/>And tottering to the couch his bride he bore,<br/>One moment gazed--as if to gaze no more;<br/>Felt that for him Earth held but her alone,<br/>Kissed her cold forehead--turned--is Conrad gone?<br/><br/>"And is he gone?"--on sudden solitude<br/>How oft that fearful question will intrude!<br/>"'Twas but an instant past, and here he stood!<br/>And now"--without the portal's porch she rushed,<br/>And then at length her tears in freedom gushed;<br/>Big, bright, and fast, unknown to her they fell;<br/>But still her lips refused to send--"Farewell!"<br/>For in that word--that fatal word--howe'er<br/>We promise--hope--believe--there breathes Despair.<br/>O'er every feature of that still, pale face,<br/>Had Sorrow fixed what Time can ne'er erase:<br/>The tender blue of that large loving eye<br/>Grew frozen with its gaze on vacancy,<br/>Till--Oh, how far!--it caught a glimpse of him,<br/>And then it flowed, and phrensied seemed to swim<br/>Through those long, dark, and glistening lashes dewed<br/>With drops of sadness oft to be renewed.<br/>"He's gone!"--against her heart that hand is driven,<br/>Convulsed and quick--then gently raised to Heaven:<br/>She looked and saw the heaving of the main:<br/>The white sail set--she dared not look again;<br/>But turned with sickening soul within the gate--<br/>"It is no dream--and I am desolate!"<br/><br/>From crag to crag descending, swiftly sped<br/>Stern Conrad down, nor once he turned his head;<br/>But shrunk whene'er the windings of his way<br/>Forced on his eye what he would not survey,<br/>His lone, but lovely dwelling on the steep,<br/>That hailed him first when homeward from the deep:<br/>And she--the dim and melancholy Star,<br/>Whose ray of Beauty reached him from afar,<br/>On her he must not gaze, he must not think--<br/>There he might rest--but on Destruction's brink:<br/>Yet once almost he stopped--and nearly gave<br/>His fate to chance, his projects to the wave:<br/>But no--it must not be--a worthy chief<br/>May melt, but not betray to Woman's grief.<br/>He sees his bark, he notes how fair the wind,<br/>And sternly gathers all his might of mind:<br/>Again he hurries on--and as he hears<br/>The clang of tumult vibrate on his ears,<br/>The busy sounds, the bustle of the shore,<br/>The shout, the signal, and the dashing oar;<br/>As marks his eye the seaboy on the mast,<br/>The anchors rise, the sails unfurling fast,<br/>The waving kerchiefs of the crowd that urge<br/>That mute Adieu to those who stem the surge;<br/>And more than all, his blood-red flag aloft,<br/>He marvelled how his heart could seem so soft.<br/>Fire in his glance, and wildness in his breast,<br/>He feels of all his former self possest;<br/>He bounds--he flies--until his footsteps reach<br/>The verge where ends the cliff, begins the beach,<br/>There checks his speed; but pauses less to breathe<br/>The breezy freshness of the deep beneath,<br/>Than there his wonted statelier step renew;<br/>Nor rush, disturbed by haste, to vulgar view:<br/>For well had Conrad learned to curb the crowd,<br/>By arts that veil, and oft preserve the proud;<br/>His was the lofty port, the distant mien,<br/>That seems to shun the sight--and awes if seen:<br/>The solemn aspect, and the high-born eye,<br/>That checks low mirth, but lacks not courtesy;<br/>All these he wielded to command assent:<br/>But where he wished to win, so well unbent,<br/>That Kindness cancelled fear in those who heard,<br/>And others' gifts showed mean beside his word,<br/>When echoed to the heart as from his own<br/>His deep yet tender melody of tone:<br/>But such was foreign to his wonted mood,<br/>He cared not what he softened, but subdued;<br/>The evil passions of his youth had made<br/>Him value less who loved--than what obeyed.<br/><br/>Around him mustering ranged his ready guard.<br/>Before him Juan stands--"Are all prepared?"<br/>"They are--nay more--embarked: the latest boat<br/>Waits but my chief----"<br/>   "My sword, and my capote."<br/>Soon firmly girded on, and lightly slung,<br/>His belt and cloak were o'er his shoulders flung:<br/>"Call Pedro here!" He comes--and Conrad bends,<br/>With all the courtesy he deigned his friends;<br/>"Receive these tablets, and peruse with care,<br/>Words of high trust and truth are graven there;<br/>Double the guard, and when Anselmo's bark<br/>Arrives, let him alike these orders mark:<br/>In three days (serve the breeze) the sun shall shine<br/>On our return--till then all peace be thine!"<br/>This said, his brother Pirate's hand he wrung,<br/>Then to his boat with haughty gesture sprung.<br/>Flashed the dipt oars, and sparkling with the stroke,<br/>Around the waves' phosphoric brightness broke;<br/>They gain the vessel--on the deck he stands,--<br/>Shrieks the shrill whistle, ply the busy hands--<br/>He marks how well the ship her helm obeys,<br/>How gallant all her crew, and deigns to praise.<br/>His eyes of pride to young Gonsalvo turn--<br/>Why doth he start, and inly seem to mourn?<br/>Alas! those eyes beheld his rocky tower,<br/>And live a moment o'er the parting hour;<br/>She--his Medora--did she mark the prow?<br/>Ah! never loved he half so much as now!<br/>But much must yet be done ere dawn of day--<br/>Again he mans himself and turns away;<br/>Down to the cabin with Gonsalvo bends,<br/>And there unfolds his plan--his means, and ends;<br/>Before them burns the lamp, and spreads the chart,<br/>And all that speaks and aids the naval art;<br/>They to the midnight watch protract debate;<br/>To anxious eyes what hour is ever late?<br/>Meantime, the steady breeze serenely blew,<br/>And fast and falcon-like the vessel flew;<br/>Passed the high headlands of each clustering isle,<br/>To gain their port--long--long ere morning smile:<br/>And soon the night-glass through the narrow bay<br/>Discovers where the Pacha's galleys lay.<br/>Count they each sail, and mark how there supine<br/>The lights in vain o'er heedless Moslem shine.<br/>Secure, unnoted, Conrad's prow passed by,<br/>And anchored where his ambush meant to lie;<br/>Screened from espial by the jutting cape,<br/>That rears on high its rude fantastic shape.<br/>Then rose his band to duty--not from sleep--<br/>Equipped for deeds alike on land or deep;<br/>While leaned their Leader o'er the fretting flood,<br/>And calmly talked--and yet he talked of blood!<br/><br/>CANTO THE SECOND.<br/><br/>          "Conosceste i dubbiosi desiri?"<br/>Dante, _Inferno_, v, 120.<br/><br/>In Coron's bay floats many a galley light,<br/>Through Coron's lattices the lamps are bright,<br/>For Seyd, the Pacha, makes a feast to-night:<br/>A feast for promised triumph yet to come,<br/>When he shall drag the fettered Rovers home;<br/>This hath he sworn by Allah and his sword,<br/>And faithful to his firman and his word,<br/>His summoned prows collect along the coast,<br/>And great the gathering crews, and loud the boast;<br/>Already shared the captives and the prize,<br/>Though far the distant foe they thus despise;<br/>'Tis but to sail--no doubt to-morrow's Sun<br/>Will see the Pirates bound--their haven won!<br/>Meantime the watch may slumber, if they will,<br/>Nor only wake to war, but dreaming kill.<br/>Though all, who can, disperse on shore and seek<br/>To flesh their glowing valour on the Greek;<br/>How well such deed becomes the turbaned brave--<br/>To bare the sabre's edge before a slave!<br/>Infest his dwelling--but forbear to slay,<br/>Their arms are strong, yet merciful to-day,<br/>And do not deign to smite because they may!<br/>Unless some gay caprice suggests the blow,<br/>To keep in practice for the coming foe.<br/>Revel and rout the evening hours beguile,<br/>And they who wish to wear a head must smile;<br/>For Moslem mouths produce their choicest cheer,<br/>And hoard their curses, till the coast is clear.<br/><br/>High in his hall reclines the turbaned Seyd;<br/>Around--the bearded chiefs he came to lead.<br/>Removed the banquet, and the last pilaff--<br/>Forbidden draughts, 'tis said, he dared to quaff,<br/>Though to the rest the sober berry's juice<br/>The slaves bear round for rigid Moslems' use;<br/>The long chibouque's dissolving cloud supply,<br/>While dance the Almas to wild minstrelsy.<br/>The rising morn will view the chiefs embark;<br/>But waves are somewhat treacherous in the dark:<br/>And revellers may more securely sleep<br/>On silken couch than o'er the rugged deep:<br/>Feast there who can--nor combat till they must,<br/>And less to conquest than to Korans trust;<br/>And yet the numbers crowded in his host<br/>Might warrant more than even the Pacha's boast.<br/><br/>With cautious reverence from the outer gate<br/>Slow stalks the slave, whose office there to wait,<br/>Bows his bent head--his hand salutes the floor,<br/>Ere yet his tongue the trusted tidings bore:<br/>"A captive Dervise, from the Pirate's nest<br/>Escaped, is here--himself would tell the rest."<br/>He took the sign from Seyd's assenting eye,<br/>And led the holy man in silence nigh.<br/>His arms were folded on his dark-green vest,<br/>His step was feeble, and his look deprest;<br/>Yet worn he seemed of hardship more than years,<br/>And pale his cheek with penance, not from fears.<br/>Vowed to his God--his sable locks he wore,<br/>And these his lofty cap rose proudly o'er:<br/>Around his form his loose long robe was thrown,<br/>And wrapt a breast bestowed on heaven alone;<br/>Submissive, yet with self-possession manned,<br/>He calmly met the curious eyes that scanned;<br/>And question of his coming fain would seek,<br/>Before the Pacha's will allowed to speak.<br/><br/>"Whence com'st thou, Dervise?"<br/>           "From the Outlaw's den<br/>A fugitive--"<br/>               "Thy capture where and when?"<br/>"From Scalanova's port to Scio's isle,<br/>The Saick was bound; but Allah did not smile<br/>Upon our course--the Moslem merchant's gains<br/>The Rovers won; our limbs have worn their chains.<br/>I had no death to fear, nor wealth to boast,<br/>Beyond the wandering freedom which I lost;<br/>At length a fisher's humble boat by night<br/>Afforded hope, and offered chance of flight;<br/>I seized the hour, and find my safety here--<br/>With thee--most mighty Pacha! who can fear?"<br/><br/>"How speed the outlaws? stand they well prepared,<br/>Their plundered wealth, and robber's rock, to guard?<br/>Dream they of this our preparation, doomed<br/>To view with fire their scorpion nest consumed?"<br/><br/>"Pacha! the fettered captive's mourning eye,<br/>That weeps for flight, but ill can play the spy;<br/>I only heard the reckless waters roar,<br/>Those waves that would not bear me from the shore;<br/>I only marked the glorious Sun and sky,<br/>Too bright--too blue--for my captivity;<br/>And felt that all which Freedom's bosom cheers<br/>Must break my chain before it dried my tears.<br/>This mayst thou judge, at least, from my escape,<br/>They little deem of aught in Peril's shape;<br/>Else vainly had I prayed or sought the Chance<br/>That leads me here--if eyed with vigilance:<br/>The careless guard that did not see me fly,<br/>May watch as idly when thy power is nigh.<br/>Pacha! my limbs are faint--and nature craves<br/>Food for my hunger, rest from tossing waves:<br/>Permit my absence--peace be with thee! Peace<br/>With all around!--now grant repose--release."<br/><br/>"Stay, Dervise! I have more to question--stay,<br/>I do command thee--sit--dost hear?--obey!<br/>More I must ask, and food the slaves shall bring;<br/>Thou shall not pine where all are banqueting:<br/>The supper done--prepare thee to reply,<br/>Clearly and full--I love not mystery."<br/>'Twere vain to guess what shook the pious man,<br/>Who looked not lovingly on that Divan;<br/>Nor showed high relish for the banquet prest,<br/>And less respect for every fellow guest.<br/>Twas but a moment's peevish hectic passed<br/>Along his cheek, and tranquillised as fast:<br/>He sate him down in silence, and his look<br/>Resumed the calmness which before forsook:<br/>The feast was ushered in--but sumptuous fare<br/>He shunned as if some poison mingled there.<br/>For one so long condemned to toil and fast,<br/>Methinks he strangely spares the rich repast.<br/>"What ails thee, Dervise? eat--dost thou suppose<br/>This feast a Christian's? or my friends thy foes?<br/>Why dost thou shun the salt? that sacred pledge,<br/>Which, once partaken, blunts the sabre's edge,<br/>Makes even contending tribes in peace unite,<br/>And hated hosts seem brethren to the sight!"<br/><br/>"Salt seasons dainties--and my food is still<br/>The humblest root, my drink the simplest rill;<br/>And my stern vow and Order's laws oppose<br/>To break or mingle bread with friends or foes;<br/>It may seem strange--if there be aught to dread<br/>That peril rests upon my single head;<br/>But for thy sway--nay more--thy Sultan's throne,<br/>I taste nor bread nor banquet--save alone;<br/>Infringed our Order's rule, the Prophet's rage<br/>To Mecca's dome might bar my pilgrimage."<br/><br/>"Well--as thou wilt--ascetic as thou art--<br/>One question answer; then in peace depart.<br/>How many?--Ha! it cannot sure be day?<br/>What Star--what Sun is bursting on the bay?<br/>It shines a lake of fire!--away--away!<br/>Ho! treachery! my guards! my scimitar!<br/>The galleys feed the flames--and I afar!<br/>Accurs√©d Dervise!--these thy tidings--thou<br/>Some villain spy--seize--cleave him--slay him now!"<br/><br/>Up rose the Dervise with that burst of light,<br/>Nor less his change of form appalled the sight:<br/>Up rose that Dervise--not in saintly garb,<br/>But like a warrior bounding on his barb,<br/>Dashed his high cap, and tore his robe away--<br/>Shone his mailed breast, and flashed his sabre's ray!<br/>His close but glittering casque, and sable plume,<br/>More glittering eye, and black brow's sabler gloom,<br/>Glared on the Moslems' eyes some Afrit Sprite,<br/>Whose demon death-blow left no hope for fight.<br/>The wild confusion, and the swarthy glow<br/>Of flames on high, and torches from below;<br/>The shriek of terror, and the mingling yell--<br/>For swords began to clash, and shouts to swell--<br/>Flung o'er that spot of earth the air of Hell!<br/>Distracted, to and fro, the flying slaves<br/>Behold but bloody shore and fiery waves;<br/>Nought heeded they the Pacha's angry cry,<br/>_They_ seize that Dervise!--seize on Zatanai!<br/>He saw their terror--checked the first despair<br/>That urged him but to stand and perish there,<br/>Since far too early and too well obeyed,<br/>The flame was kindled ere the signal made;<br/>He saw their terror--from his baldric drew<br/>His bugle--brief the blast--but shrilly blew;<br/>'Tis answered--"Well ye speed, my gallant crew!<br/>Why did I doubt their quickness of career?<br/>And deem design had left me single here?"<br/>Sweeps his long arm--that sabre's whirling sway<br/>Sheds fast atonement for its first delay;<br/>Completes his fury, what their fear begun,<br/>And makes the many basely quail to one.<br/>The cloven turbans o'er the chamber spread,<br/>And scarce an arm dare rise to guard its head:<br/>Even Seyd, convulsed, o'erwhelmed, with rage, surprise,<br/>Retreats before him, though he still defies.<br/>No craven he--and yet he dreads the blow,<br/>So much Confusion magnifies his foe!<br/>His blazing galleys still distract his sight,<br/>He tore his beard, and foaming fled the fight;<br/>For now the pirates passed the Haram gate,<br/>And burst within--and it were death to wait;<br/>Where wild Amazement shrieking--kneeling--throws<br/>The sword aside--in vain--the blood o'erflows!<br/>The Corsairs pouring, haste to where within<br/>Invited Conrad's bugle, and the din<br/>Of groaning victims, and wild cries for life,<br/>Proclaimed how well he did the work of strife.<br/>They shout to find him grim and lonely there,<br/>A glutted tiger mangling in his lair!<br/>But short their greeting, shorter his reply--<br/>"'Tis well--but Seyd escapes--and he must die--<br/>Much hath been done--but more remains to do--<br/>Their galleys blaze--why not their city too?"<br/><br/>Quick at the word they seized him each a torch,<br/>And fire the dome from minaret to porch.<br/>A stern delight was fixed in Conrad's eye,<br/>But sudden sunk--for on his ear the cry<br/>Of women struck, and like a deadly knell<br/>Knocked at that heart unmoved by Battle's yell.<br/>"Oh! burst the Haram--wrong not on your lives<br/>One female form--remember--_we_ have wives.<br/>On them such outrage Vengeance will repay;<br/>Man is our foe, and such 'tis ours to slay:<br/>But still we spared--must spare the weaker prey.<br/>Oh! I forgot--but Heaven will not forgive<br/>If at my word the helpless cease to live;<br/>Follow who will--I go--we yet have time<br/>Our souls to lighten of at least a crime."<br/>He climbs the crackling stair--he bursts the door,<br/>Nor feels his feet glow scorching with the floor;<br/>His breath choked gasping with the volumed smoke,<br/>But still from room to room his way he broke.<br/>They search--they find--they save: with lusty arms<br/>Each bears a prize of unregarded charms;<br/>Calm their loud fears; sustain their sinking frames<br/>With all the care defenceless Beauty claims:<br/>So well could Conrad tame their fiercest mood,<br/>And check the very hands with gore imbrued.<br/>But who is she? whom Conrad's arms convey,<br/>From reeking pile and combat's wreck, away--<br/>Who but the love of him he dooms to bleed?<br/>The Haram queen--but still the slave of Seyd!<br/><br/>Brief time had Conrad now to greet Gulnare,<br/>Few words to reassure the trembling Fair;<br/>For in that pause Compassion snatched from War,<br/>The foe before retiring, fast and far,<br/>With wonder saw their footsteps unpursued,<br/>First slowlier fled--then rallied--then withstood.<br/>This Seyd perceives, then first perceives how few,<br/>Compared with his, the Corsair's roving crew,<br/>And blushes o'er his error, as he eyes<br/>The ruin wrought by Panic and Surprise.<br/>Alla il Alla! Vengeance swells the cry--<br/>Shame mounts to rage that must atone or die!<br/>And flame for flame and blood for blood must tell.<br/>The tide of triumph ebbs that flowed too well--<br/>When Wrath returns to renovated strife,<br/>And those who fought for conquest strike for life.<br/>Conrad beheld the danger--he beheld<br/>His followers faint by freshening foes repelled:<br/>"One effort--one--to break the circling host!"<br/>They form--unite--charge--waver--all is lost!<br/>Within a narrower ring compressed, beset,<br/>Hopeless, not heartless, strive and struggle yet--<br/>Ah!

I look to none; my lips proclaim<br/>What last proclaimed they--Conrad still the same:<br/>Why should'st thou seek an outlaw's life to spare,<br/>And change the sentence I deserve to bear?<br/>Well have I earned--nor here alone--the meed<br/>Of Seyd's revenge, by many a lawless deed."<br/><br/>"Why should I seek? because--Oh! did'st thou not<br/>Redeem my life from worse than Slavery's lot?<br/>Why should I seek?--hath Misery made thee blind<br/>To the fond workings of a woman's mind?<br/>And must I say?--albeit my heart rebel<br/>With all that Woman feels, but should not tell--<br/>Because--despite thy crimes--that heart is moved:<br/>It feared thee--thanked thee--pitied--maddened--loved.<br/>Reply not, tell not now thy tale again,<br/>Thou lov'st another--and I love in vain:<br/>Though fond as mine her bosom, form more fair,<br/>I rush through peril which she would not dare.<br/>If that thy heart to hers were truly dear,<br/>Were I thine own--thou wert not lonely here:<br/>An outlaw's spouse--and leave her Lord to roam!<br/>What hath such gentle dame to do with home?<br/>But speak not now--o'er thine and o'er my head<br/>Hangs the keen sabre by a single thread;<br/>If thou hast courage still, and would'st be free,<br/>Receive this poniard--rise and follow me!"<br/><br/>"Aye--in my chains! my steps will gently tread,<br/>With these adornments, o'er such slumbering head!<br/>Thou hast forgot--is this a garb for flight?<br/>Or is that instrument more fit for fight?"<br/><br/>"Misdoubting Corsair! I have gained the guard,<br/>Ripe for revolt, and greedy for reward.<br/>A single word of mine removes that chain:<br/>Without some aid how here could I remain?<br/>Well, since we met, hath sped my busy time,<br/>If in aught evil, for thy sake the crime:<br/>The crime--'tis none to punish those of Seyd.<br/>That hatred tyrant, Conrad--he must bleed!<br/>I see thee shudder, but my soul is changed--<br/>Wronged--spurned--reviled--and it shall be avenged--<br/>Accused of what till now my heart disdained--<br/>Too faithful, though to bitter bondage chained.<br/>Yes, smile!--but he had little cause to sneer,<br/>I was not treacherous then, nor thou too dear:<br/>But he has said it--and the jealous well,--<br/>Those tyrants--teasing--tempting to rebel,--<br/>Deserve the fate their fretting lips foretell.<br/>I never loved--he bought me--somewhat high--<br/>Since with me came a heart he could not buy.<br/>I was a slave unmurmuring; he hath said,<br/>But for his rescue I with thee had fled.<br/>'Twas false thou know'st--but let such Augurs rue,<br/>Their words are omens Insult renders true.<br/>Nor was thy respite granted to my prayer;<br/>This fleeting grace was only to prepare<br/>New torments for thy life, and my despair.<br/>Mine too he threatens; but his dotage still<br/>Would fain reserve me for his lordly will:<br/>When wearier of these fleeting charms and me,<br/>There yawns the sack--and yonder rolls the sea!<br/>What, am I then a toy for dotard's play,<br/>To wear but till the gilding frets away?<br/>I saw thee--loved thee--owe thee all--would save,<br/>If but to show how grateful is a slave.<br/>But had he not thus menaced fame and life,--<br/>And well he keeps his oaths pronounced in strife--<br/>I still had saved thee--but the Pacha spared:<br/>Now I am all thine own--for all prepared:<br/>Thou lov'st me not--nor know'st--or but the worst.<br/>Alas! _this_ love--_that_ hatred--are the first--<br/>Oh! could'st thou prove my truth, thou would'st not start,<br/>Nor fear the fire that lights an Eastern heart;<br/>'Tis now the beacon of thy safety--now<br/>It points within the port a Mainote prow:<br/>But in one chamber, where our path must lead,<br/>There sleeps--he must not wake--the oppressor Seyd!"<br/><br/>"Gulnare--Gulnare--I never felt till now<br/>My abject fortune, withered fame so low:<br/>Seyd is mine enemy; had swept my band<br/>From earth with ruthless but with open hand,<br/>And therefore came I, in my bark of war,<br/>To smite the smiter with the scimitar;<br/>Such is my weapon--not the secret knife;<br/>Who spares a Woman's seeks not Slumber's life.<br/>Thine saved I gladly, Lady--not for this;<br/>Let me not deem that mercy shown amiss.<br/>Now fare thee well--more peace be with thy breast!<br/>Night wears apace, my last of earthly rest!"<br/><br/>"Rest! rest! by sunrise must thy sinews shake,<br/>And thy limbs writhe around the ready stake,<br/>I heard the order--saw--I will not see--<br/>If thou wilt perish, I will fall with thee.<br/>My life--my love--my hatred--all below<br/>Are on this cast--Corsair! 'tis but a blow!<br/>Without it flight were idle--how evade<br/>His sure pursuit?--my wrongs too unrepaid,<br/>My youth disgraced--the long, long wasted years,<br/>One blow shall cancel with our future fears;<br/>But since the dagger suits thee less than brand,<br/>I'll try the firmness of a female hand.<br/>The guards are gained--one moment all were o'er--<br/>Corsair! we meet in safety or no more;<br/>If errs my feeble hand, the morning cloud<br/>Will hover o'er thy scaffold, and my shroud."<br/><br/>She turned, and vanished ere he could reply,<br/>But his glance followed far with eager eye;<br/>And gathering, as he could, the links that bound<br/>His form, to curl their length, and curb their sound,<br/>Since bar and bolt no more his steps preclude,<br/>He, fast as fettered limbs allow, pursued.<br/>'Twas dark and winding, and he knew not where<br/>That passage led; nor lamp nor guard was there:<br/>He sees a dusky glimmering--shall he seek<br/>Or shun that ray so indistinct and weak?<br/>Chance guides his steps--a freshness seems to bear<br/>Full on his brow as if from morning air;<br/>He reached an open gallery--on his eye<br/>Gleamed the last star of night, the clearing sky:<br/>Yet scarcely heeded these--another light<br/>From a lone chamber struck upon his sight.<br/>Towards it he moved; a scarcely closing door<br/>Revealed the ray within, but nothing more.<br/>With hasty step a figure outward passed,<br/>Then paused, and turned--and paused--'tis She at last!<br/>No poniard in that hand, nor sign of ill--<br/>"Thanks to that softening heart--she could not kill!"<br/>Again he looked, the wildness of her eye<br/>Starts from the day abrupt and fearfully.<br/>She stopped--threw back her dark far-floating hair,<br/>That nearly veiled her face and bosom fair,<br/>As if she late had bent her leaning head<br/>Above some object of her doubt or dread.<br/>They meet--upon her brow--unknown--forgot--<br/>Her hurrying hand had left--'twas but a spot--<br/>Its hue was all he saw, and scarce withstood--<br/>Oh! slight but certain pledge of crime--'tis Blood!<br/><br/>He had seen battle--he had brooded lone<br/>O'er promised pangs to sentenced Guilt foreshown;<br/>He had been tempted--chastened--and the chain<br/>Yet on his arms might ever there remain:<br/>But ne'er from strife--captivity--remorse--<br/>From all his feelings in their inmost force--<br/>So thrilled, so shuddered every creeping vein,<br/>As now they froze before that purple stain.<br/>That spot of blood, that light but guilty streak,<br/>Had banished all the beauty from her cheek!<br/>Blood he had viewed--could view unmoved--but then<br/>It flowed in combat, or was shed by men!<br/><br/>"'Tis done--he nearly waked--but it is done.<br/>Corsair! he perished--thou art dearly won.<br/>All words would now be vain--away--away!<br/>Our bark is tossing--'tis already day.<br/>The few gained over, now are wholly mine,<br/>And these thy yet surviving band shall join:<br/>Anon my voice shall vindicate my hand,<br/>When once our sail forsakes this hated strand."<br/><br/>She clapped her hands, and through the gallery pour,<br/>Equipped for flight, her vassals--Greek and Moor;<br/>Silent but quick they stoop, his chains unbind;<br/>Once more his limbs are free as mountain wind!<br/>But on his heavy heart such sadness sate,<br/>As if they there transferred that iron weight.<br/>No words are uttered--at her sign, a door<br/>Reveals the secret passage to the shore;<br/>The city lies behind--they speed, they reach<br/>The glad waves dancing on the yellow beach;<br/>And Conrad following, at her beck, obeyed,<br/>Nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed;<br/>Resistance were as useless as if Seyd<br/>Yet lived to view the doom his ire decreed.<br/><br/>Embarked--the sail unfurled--the light breeze blew--<br/>How much had Conrad's memory to review!<br/>Sunk he in contemplation, till the Cape<br/>Where last he anchored reared its giant shape.<br/>Ah!--since that fatal night, though brief the time,<br/>Had swept an age of terror, grief, and crime.<br/>As its far shadow frowned above the mast,<br/>He veiled his face, and sorrowed as he passed;<br/>He thought of all--Gonsalvo and his band,<br/>His fleeting triumph and his failing hand;<br/>He thought on her afar, his lonely bride:<br/>He turned and saw--Gulnare, the Homicide!<br/><br/>She watched his features till she could not bear<br/>Their freezing aspect and averted air;<br/>And that strange fierceness foreign to her eye<br/>Fell quenched in tears, too late to shed or dry.<br/>She knelt beside him and his hand she pressed,<br/>"Thou may'st forgive though Allah's self detest;<br/>But for that deed of darkness what wert thou?<br/>Reproach me--but not yet--Oh! spare me _now!_<br/>I am not what I seem--this fearful night<br/>My brain bewildered--do not madden quite!<br/>If I had never loved--though less my guilt--<br/>Thou hadst not lived to--hate me--if thou wilt."<br/><br/>She wrongs his thoughts--they more himself upbraid<br/>Than her--though undesigned--the wretch he made;<br/>But speechless all, deep, dark, and unexprest,<br/>They bleed within that silent cell--his breast.<br/>Still onward, fair the breeze, nor rough the surge,<br/>The blue waves sport around the stern they urge;<br/>Far on the Horizon's verge appears a speck,<br/>A spot--a mast--a sail--an arm√©d deck!<br/>Their little bark her men of watch descry,<br/>And ampler canvass woos the wind from high;<br/>She bears her down majestically near,<br/>Speed on her prow, and terror in her tier;<br/>A flash is seen--the ball beyond her bow<br/>Booms harmless, hissing to the deep below.<br/>Up rose keen Conrad from his silent trance,<br/>A long, long absent gladness in his glance;<br/>"'Tis mine--my blood-rag flag! again--again--<br/>I am not all deserted on the main!"<br/>They own the signal, answer to the hail,<br/>Hoist out the boat at once, and slacken sail.<br/>"'Tis Conrad! Conrad!" shouting from the deck,<br/>Command nor Duty could their transport check!<br/>With light alacrity and gaze of Pride,<br/>They view him mount once more his vessel's side;<br/>A smile relaxing in each rugged face,<br/>Their arms can scarce forbear a rough embrace.<br/>He, half forgetting danger and defeat,<br/>Returns their greeting as a Chief may greet,<br/>Wrings with a cordial grasp Anselmo's hand,<br/>And feels he yet can conquer and command!<br/><br/>These greetings o'er, the feelings that o'erflow,<br/>Yet grieve to win him back without a blow;<br/>They sailed prepared for vengeance--had they known<br/>A woman's hand secured that deed her own,<br/>She were their Queen--less scrupulous are they<br/>Than haughty Conrad how they win their way.<br/>With many an asking smile, and wondering stare,<br/>They whisper round, and gaze upon Gulnare;<br/>And her, at once above--beneath her sex,<br/>Whom blood appalled not, their regards perplex.<br/>To Conrad turns her faint imploring eye,<br/>She drops her veil, and stands in silence by;<br/>Her arms are meekly folded on that breast,<br/>Which--Conrad safe--to Fate resigned the rest.<br/>Though worse than frenzy could that bosom fill,<br/>Extreme in love or hate, in good or ill,<br/>The worst of crimes had left her Woman still!<br/><br/>This Conrad marked, and felt--ah! could he less?--<br/>Hate of that deed--but grief for her distress;<br/>What she has done no tears can wash away,<br/>And Heaven must punish on its angry day:<br/>But--it was done: he knew, whate'er her guilt,<br/>For him that poniard smote, that blood was spilt;<br/>And he was free!--and she for him had given<br/>Her all on earth, and more than all in heaven!<br/>And now he turned him to that dark-eyed slave<br/>Whose brow was bowed beneath the glance he gave,<br/>Who now seemed changed and humbled, faint and meek,<br/>But varying oft the colour of her cheek<br/>To deeper shades of paleness--all its red<br/>That fearful spot which stained it from the dead!<br/>He took that hand--it trembled--now too late--<br/>So soft in love--so wildly nerved in hate;<br/>He clasped that hand--it trembled--and his own<br/>Had lost its firmness, and his voice its tone.<br/>"Gulnare!"--but she replied not--"dear Gulnare!"<br/>She raised her eye--her only answer there--<br/>At once she sought and sunk in his embrace:<br/>If he had driven her from that resting-place,<br/>His had been more or less than mortal heart,<br/>But--good or ill--it bade her not depart.<br/>Perchance, but for the bodings of his breast,<br/>His latest virtue then had joined the rest.<br/>Yet even Medora might forgive the kiss<br/>That asked from form so fair no more than this,<br/>The first, the last that Frailty stole from Faith--<br/>To lips where Love had lavished all his breath,<br/>To lips--whose broken sighs such fragrance fling,<br/>As he had fanned them freshly with his wing!<br/><br/>They gain by twilight's hour their lonely isle.<br/>To them the very rocks appear to smile;<br/>The haven hums with many a cheering sound,<br/>The beacons blaze their wonted stations round,<br/>The boats are darting o'er the curly bay,<br/>And sportive Dolphins bend them through the spray;<br/>Even the hoarse sea-bird's shrill, discordant shriek,<br/>Greets like the welcome of his tuneless beak!<br/>Beneath each lamp that through its lattice gleams,<br/>Their fancy paints the friends that trim the beams.<br/>Oh! what can sanctify the joys of home,<br/>Like Hope's gay glance from Ocean's troubled foam?<br/><br/>The lights are high on beacon and from bower,<br/>And 'midst them Conrad seeks Medora's tower:<br/>He looks in vain--'tis strange--and all remark,<br/>Amid so many, hers alone is dark.<br/>'Tis strange--of yore its welcome never failed,<br/>Nor now, perchance, extinguished--only veiled.<br/>With the first boat descends he for the shore,<br/>And looks impatient on the lingering oar.<br/>Oh! for a wing beyond the falcon's flight,<br/>To bear him like an arrow to that height!<br/>With the first pause the resting rowers gave,<br/>He waits not--looks not--leaps into the wave,<br/>Strives through the surge, bestrides the beach, and high<br/>Ascends the path familiar to his eye.<br/><br/>He reached his turret door--he paused--no sound<br/>Broke from within; and all was night around.<br/>He knocked, and loudly--footstep nor reply<br/>Announced that any heard or deemed him nigh:<br/>He knocked, but faintly--for his trembling hand<br/>Refused to aid his heavy heart's demand.<br/>The portal opens--'tis a well known face--<br/>But not the form he panted to embrace.<br/>Its lips are silent--twice his own essayed,<br/>And failed to frame the question they delayed;<br/>He snatched the lamp--its light will answer all--<br/>It quits his grasp, expiring in the fall.<br/>He would not wait for that reviving ray--<br/>As soon could he have lingered there for day;<br/>But, glimmering through the dusky corridor,<br/>Another chequers o'er the shadowed floor;<br/>His steps the chamber gain--his eyes behold<br/>All that his heart believed not--yet foretold!<br/><br/>He turned not--spoke not--sunk not--fixed his look,<br/>And set the anxious frame that lately shook:<br/>He gazed--how long we gaze despite of pain,<br/>And know, but dare not own, we gaze in vain!<br/>In life itself she was so still and fair,<br/>That Death with gentler aspect withered there;<br/>And the cold flowers her colder hand contained,<br/>In that last grasp as tenderly were strained<br/>As if she scarcely felt, but feigned a sleep--<br/>And made it almost mockery yet to weep:<br/>The long dark lashes fringed her lids of snow,<br/>And veiled--Thought shrinks from all that lurked below--Oh!<br/>o'er the eye Death most exerts his might,<br/>And hurls the Spirit from her throne of light;<br/>Sinks those blue orbs in that long last eclipse,<br/>But spares, as yet, the charm around her lips--<br/>Yet, yet they seem as they forebore to smile,<br/>And wished repose,--but only for a while;<br/>But the white shroud, and each extended tress,<br/>Long, fair--but spread in utter lifelessness,<br/>Which, late the sport of every summer wind,<br/>Escaped the baffled wreath that strove to bind;<br/>These--and the pale pure cheek, became the bier--<br/>But She is nothing--wherefore is he here?<br/><br/>He asked no question--all were answered now<br/>By the first glance on that still, marble brow.<br/>It was enough--she died--what recked it how?<br/>The love of youth, the hope of better years,<br/>The source of softest wishes, tenderest fears,<br/>The only living thing he could not hate,<br/>Was reft at once--and he deserved his fate,<br/>But did not feel it less;--the Good explore,<br/>For peace, those realms where Guilt can never soar:<br/>The proud, the wayward--who have fixed below<br/>Their joy, and find this earth enough for woe,<br/>Lose in that one their all--perchance a mite--<br/>But who in patience parts with all delight?<br/>Full many a stoic eye and aspect stern<br/>Mask hearts where Grief hath little left to learn;<br/>And many a withering thought lies hid, not lost,<br/>In smiles that least befit who wear them most.<br/><br/>By those, that deepest feel, is ill exprest<br/>The indistinctness of the suffering breast;<br/>Where thousand thoughts begin to end in one,<br/>Which seeks from all the refuge found in none;<br/>No words suffice the secret soul to show,<br/>For Truth denies all eloquence to Woe.<br/>On Conrad's stricken soul Exhaustion prest,<br/>And Stupor almost lulled it into rest;<br/>So feeble now--his mother's softness crept<br/>To those wild eyes, which like an infant's wept:<br/>It was the very weakness of his brain,<br/>Which thus confessed without relieving pain.<br/>None saw his trickling tears--perchance, if seen,<br/>That useless flood of grief had never been:<br/>Nor long they flowed--he dried them to depart,<br/>In helpless--hopeless--brokenness of heart:<br/>The Sun goes forth, but Conrad's day is dim:<br/>And the night cometh--ne'er to pass from him.<br/>There is no darkness like the cloud of mind,<br/>On Grief's vain eye--the blindest of the blind!<br/>Which may not--dare not see--but turns aside<br/>To blackest shade--nor will endure a guide!<br/><br/>His heart was formed for softness--warped to wrong,<br/>Betrayed too early, and beguiled too long;<br/>Each feeling pure--as falls the dropping dew<br/>Within the grot--like that had hardened too;<br/>Less clear, perchance, its earthly trials passed,<br/>But sunk, and chilled, and petrified at last.<br/>Yet tempests wear, and lightning cleaves the rock;<br/>If such his heart, so shattered it the shock.<br/>There grew one flower beneath its rugged brow,<br/>Though dark the shade--it sheltered--saved till now.<br/>The thunder came--that bolt hath blasted both,<br/>The Granite's firmness, and the Lily's growth:<br/>The gentle plant hath left no leaf to tell<br/>Its tale, but shrunk and withered where it fell;<br/>And of its cold protector, blacken round<br/>But shivered fragments on the barren ground!<br/><br/>'Tis morn--to venture on his lonely hour<br/>Few dare; though now Anselmo sought his tower.<br/>He was not there, nor seen along the shore;<br/>Ere night, alarmed, their isle is traversed o'er:<br/>Another morn--another bids them seek,<br/>And shout his name till Echo waxeth weak;<br/>Mount--grotto--cavern--valley searched in vain,<br/>They find on shore a sea-boat's broken chain:<br/>Their hope revives--they follow o'er the main.<br/>'Tis idle all--moons roll on moons away,<br/>And Conrad comes not, came not since that day:<br/>Nor trace nor tidings of his doom declare<br/>Where lives his grief, or perished his despair!<br/>Long mourned his band whom none could mourn beside;<br/>And fair the monument they gave his Bride:<br/>For him they raise not the recording stone--<br/>His death yet dubious, deeds too widely known;<br/>He left a Corsair's name to other times,<br/>Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes.
