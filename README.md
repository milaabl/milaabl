  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Prologue to Mr Addison's Tragedy of Cato. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    To wake the soul by tender strokes of art,<br/>To raise the genius, and to mend the heart;<br/>To make mankind, in conscious virtue bold,<br/>Live o'er each scene, and be what they behold:<br/>For this the tragic Muse first trod the stage,<br/>Commanding tears to stream through every age;<br/>Tyrants no more their savage nature kept,<br/>And foes to virtue wonder'd how they wept.<br/>Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move<br/>The hero's glory, or the virgin's love;<br/>In pitying love, we but our weakness show,<br/>And wild ambition well deserves its woe.<br/>Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause,<br/>Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws:<br/>He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise,<br/>And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes.<br/>Virtue confess'd in human shape he draws,<br/>What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was:<br/>No common object to your sight displays,<br/>But what with pleasure Heaven itself surveys,<br/>A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,<br/>And greatly falling with a falling state.<br/>While Cato gives his little senate laws,<br/>What bosom beats not in his country's cause?<br/>Who sees him act, but envies every deed?<br/>Who hears him groan, and does not wish to bleed?<br/>Even when proud Caesar, 'midst triumphal cars,<br/>The spoils of nations, and the pomp of wars,<br/>Ignobly vain and impotently great,<br/>Show'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state;<br/>As her dead father's reverend image pass'd,<br/>The pomp was darken'd and the day o'ercast;<br/>The triumph ceased, tears gush'd from every eye;<br/>The world's great victor pass'd unheeded by;<br/>Her last good man dejected Rome adored,<br/>And honour'd Caesar's less than Cato's sword.<br/><br/>Britons, attend: be worth like this approved,<br/>And show you have the virtue to be moved.<br/>With honest scorn the first famed Cato view'd<br/>Rome learning arts from Greece, whom she subdued;<br/>Your scene precariously subsists too long<br/>On French translation, and Italian song.<br/>Dare to have sense yourselves; assert the stage,<br/>Be justly warm'd with your own native rage;<br/>Such plays alone should win a British ear,<br/>As Cato's self had not disdain'd to hear.
</p>
