# üíÆ The Morgante Maggiore of Pulci by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    CANTO THE FIRST.<br/><br/>In the beginning was the Word next God;<br/>  God was the Word, the Word no less was He:<br/>This was in the beginning, to my mode<br/>  Of thinking, and without Him nought could be:<br/>Therefore, just Lord! from out thy high abode,<br/>  Benign and pious, bid an angel flee,<br/>One only, to be my companion, who<br/>Shall help my famous, worthy, old song through.<br/><br/>And thou, oh Virgin! daughter, mother, bride,<br/>  Of the same Lord, who gave to you each key<br/>Of Heaven, and Hell, and every thing beside,<br/>  The day thy Gabriel said "All hail!" to thee,<br/>Since to thy servants Pity's ne'er denied,<br/>  With flowing rhymes, a pleasant style and free,<br/>Be to my verses then benignly kind,<br/>And to the end illuminate my mind.<br/><br/>'Twas in the season when sad Philomel<br/>  Weeps with her sister, who remembers and<br/>Deplores the ancient woes which both befel,<br/>  And makes the nymphs enamoured, to the hand<br/>Of Pha√´ton, by Phoebus loved so well,<br/>  His car (but tempered by his sire's command)<br/>Was given, and on the horizon's verge just now<br/>Appeared, so that Tithonus scratched his brow:<br/><br/>When I prepared my bark first to obey,<br/>  As it should still obey, the helm, my mind,<br/>And carry prose or rhyme, and this my lay<br/>  Of Charles the Emperor, whom you will find<br/>By several pens already praised; but they<br/>  Who to diffuse his glory were inclined,<br/>For all that I can see in prose or verse,<br/>Have understood Charles badly, and wrote worse.<br/><br/>Leonardo Aretino said already,<br/>  That if, like Pepin, Charles had had a writer<br/>Of genius quick, and diligently steady,<br/>  No hero would in history look brighter;<br/>He in the cabinet being always ready,<br/>  And in the field a most victorious fighter,<br/>Who for the church and Christian faith had wrought,<br/>Certes, far more than yet is said or thought.<br/><br/>You still may see at Saint Liberatore,<br/>  The abbey, no great way from Manopell,<br/>Erected in the Abruzzi to his glory,<br/>  Because of the great battle in which fell<br/>A pagan king, according to the story,<br/>  And felon people whom Charles sent to Hell:<br/>And there are bones so many, and so many,<br/>Near them Giusaffa's would seem few, if any.<br/><br/>But the world, blind and ignorant, don't prize<br/>  His virtues as I wish to see them: thou,<br/>Florence, by his great bounty don't arise,<br/>  And hast, and may have, if thou wilt allow,<br/>All proper customs and true courtesies:<br/>  Whate'er thou hast acquired from then till now,<br/>With knightly courage, treasure, or the lance,<br/>Is sprung from out the noble blood of France.<br/><br/>Twelve Paladins had Charles in court, of whom<br/>  The wisest and most famous was Orlando;<br/>Him traitor Gan conducted to the tomb<br/>  In Roncesvalles, as the villain planned too,<br/>While the horn rang so loud, and knelled the doom<br/>  Of their sad rout, though he did all knight can do:<br/>And Dante in his comedy has given<br/>To him a happy seat with Charles in Heaven.<br/><br/>'Twas Christmas-day; in Paris all his court<br/>  Charles held; the Chief, I say, Orlando was,<br/>The Dane; Astolfo there too did resort,<br/>  Also Ansuigi, the gay time to pass<br/>In festival and in triumphal sport,<br/>  The much-renowned St. Dennis being the cause;<br/>Angiolin of Bayonne, and Oliver,<br/>And gentle Belinghieri too came there:<br/><br/>Avolio, and Arino, and Othone<br/>  Of Normandy, and Richard Paladin,<br/>Wise Hamo, and the ancient Salamone,<br/>  Walter of Lion's Mount, and Baldovin,<br/>Who was the son of the sad Ganellone,<br/>  Were there, exciting too much gladness in<br/>The son of Pepin:--when his knights came hither,<br/>He groaned with joy to see them altogether.<br/><br/>But watchful Fortune, lurking, takes good heed<br/>  Ever some bar 'gainst our intents to bring.<br/>While Charles reposed him thus, in word and deed,<br/>  Orlando ruled court, Charles, and every thing;<br/>Curst Gan, with envy bursting, had such need<br/>  To vent his spite, that thus with Charles the king<br/>One day he openly began to say,<br/>"Orlando must we always then obey?<br/><br/>"A thousand times I've been about to say,<br/>  Orlando too presumptuously goes on;<br/>Here are we, counts, kings, dukes, to own thy sway,<br/>  Hamo, and Otho, Ogier, Solomon,<br/>Each have to honour thee and to obey;<br/>  But he has too much credit near the throne,<br/>Which we won't suffer, but are quite decided<br/>By such a boy to be no longer guided.<br/><br/>"And even at Aspramont thou didst begin<br/>  To let him know he was a gallant knight,<br/>And by the fount did much the day to win;<br/>  But I know _who_ that day had won the fight<br/>If it had not for good Gherardo been;<br/>  The victory was Almonte's else; his sight<br/>He kept upon the standard--and the laurels,<br/>In fact and fairness, are his earning, Charles!<br/><br/>"If thou rememberest being in Gascony,<br/>  When there advanced the nations out of Spain<br/>The Christian cause had suffered shamefully,<br/>  Had not his valour driven them back again.<br/>Best speak the truth when there's a reason why:<br/>  Know then, oh Emperor! that all complain:<br/>As for myself, I shall repass the mounts<br/>O'er which I crossed with two and sixty counts.<br/><br/>"'Tis fit thy grandeur should dispense relief,<br/>  So that each here may have his proper part,<br/>For the whole court is more or less in grief:<br/>  Perhaps thou deem'st this lad a Mars in heart?"<br/>Orlando one day heard this speech in brief,<br/>  As by himself it chanced he sate apart:<br/>Displeased he was with Gan because he said it,<br/>But much more still that Charles should give him credit.<br/><br/>And with the sword he would have murdered Gan,<br/>  But Oliver thrust in between the pair,<br/>And from his hand extracted Durlindan,<br/>  And thus at length they separated were.<br/>Orlando angry too with Carloman,<br/>  Wanted but little to have slain him there;<br/>Then forth alone from Paris went the Chief,<br/>And burst and maddened with disdain and grief.<br/><br/>From Ermellina, consort of the Dane,<br/>  He took Cortana, and then took Rondell,<br/>And on towards Brara pricked him o'er the plain;<br/>  And when she saw him coming, Aldabelle<br/>Stretched forth her arms to clasp her lord again:<br/>  Orlando, in whose brain all was not well,<br/>As "Welcome, my Orlando, home," she said,<br/>Raised up his sword to smite her on the head.<br/><br/>Like him a Fury counsels, his revenge<br/>  On Gan in that rash act he seemed to take,<br/>Which Aldabella thought extremely strange;<br/>  But soon Orlando found himself awake;<br/>And his spouse took his bridle on this change,<br/>  And he dismounted from his horse, and spake<br/>Of every thing which passed without demur,<br/>And then reposed himself some days with her.<br/><br/>Then full of wrath departed from the place,<br/>  As far as pagan countries roamed astray,<br/>And while he rode, yet still at every pace<br/>  The traitor Gan remembered by the way;<br/>And wandering on in error a long space,<br/>  An abbey which in a lone desert lay,<br/>'Midst glens obscure, and distant lands, he found,<br/>Which formed the Christian's and the Pagan's bound.<br/><br/>The Abbot was called Clermont, and by blood<br/>  Descended from Angrante: under cover<br/>Of a great mountain's brow the abbey stood,<br/>  But certain savage giants looked him over;<br/>One Passamont was foremost of the brood,<br/>  And Alabaster and Morgante hover<br/>Second and third, with certain slings, and throw<br/>In daily jeopardy the place below.<br/><br/>The monks could pass the convent gate no more,<br/>  Nor leave their cells for water or for wood;<br/>Orlando knocked, but none would ope, before<br/>  Unto the Prior it at length seemed good;<br/>Entered, he said that he was taught to adore<br/>  Him who was born of Mary's holiest blood,<br/>And was baptized a Christian; and then showed<br/>How to the abbey he had found his road.<br/><br/>Said the Abbot, "You are welcome; what is mine<br/>  We give you freely, since that you believe<br/>With us in Mary Mother's Son divine;<br/>  And that you may not, Cavalier, conceive<br/>The cause of our delay to let you in<br/>  To be rusticity, you shall receive<br/>The reason why our gate was barred to you:<br/>Thus those who in suspicion live must do.<br/><br/>"When hither to inhabit first we came<br/>  These mountains, albeit that they are obscure,<br/>As you perceive, yet without fear or blame<br/>  They seemed to promise an asylum sure:<br/>From savage brutes alone, too fierce to tame,<br/>  'Twas fit our quiet dwelling to secure;<br/>But now, if here we'd stay, we needs must guard<br/>Against domestic beasts with watch and ward.<br/><br/>"These make us stand, in fact, upon the watch;<br/>  For late there have appeared three giants rough,<br/>What nation or what kingdom bore the batch<br/>  I know not, but they are all of savage stuff;<br/>When Force and Malice with some genius match,<br/>  You know, they can do all--_we_ are not enough:<br/>And these so much our orisons derange,<br/>I know not what to do, till matters change.<br/><br/>"Our ancient fathers, living the desert in,<br/>  For just and holy works were duly fed;<br/>Think not they lived on locusts sole, 'tis certain<br/>  That manna was rained down from heaven instead;<br/>But here 'tis fit we keep on the alert in<br/>  Our bounds, or taste the stones showered down for bread,<br/>From off yon mountain daily raining faster,<br/>And flung by Passamont and Alabaster.<br/><br/>"The third, Morgante, 's savagest by far; he<br/>  Plucks up pines, beeches, poplar-trees, and oaks,<br/>And flings them, our community to bury;<br/>  And all that I can do but more provokes."<br/>While thus they parley in the cemetery,<br/>  A stone from one of their gigantic strokes,<br/>Which nearly crushed Rondell, came tumbling over,<br/>So that he took a long leap under cover.<br/><br/>"For God-sake, Cavalier, come in with speed;<br/>  The manna's falling now," the Abbot cried.<br/>"This fellow does not wish my horse should feed,<br/>  Dear Abbot," Roland unto him replied,<br/>"Of restiveness he'd cure him had he need;<br/>  That stone seems with good will and aim applied."<br/>The holy father said, "I don't deceive;<br/>They'll one day fling the mountain, I believe."<br/><br/>Orlando bade them take care of Rondello,<br/>  And also made a breakfast of his own;<br/>"Abbot," he said, "I want to find that fellow<br/>  Who flung at my good horse yon corner-stone."<br/>Said the abbot, "Let not my advice seem shallow;<br/>  As to a brother dear I speak alone;<br/>I would dissuade you, Baron, from this strife,<br/>As knowing sure that you will lose your life.<br/><br/>"That Passamont has in his hand three darts--<br/>  Such slings, clubs, ballast-stones, that yield you must:<br/>You know that giants have much stouter hearts<br/>  Than us, with reason, in proportion just:<br/>If go you will, guard well against their arts,<br/>  For these are very barbarous and robust."<br/>Orlando answered," This I'll see, be sure,<br/>And walk the wild on foot to be secure."<br/><br/>The Abbot signed the great cross on his front,<br/>  "Then go you with God's benison and mine."<br/>Orlando, after he had scaled the mount,<br/>  As the Abbot had directed, kept the line<br/>Right to the usual haunt of Passamont;<br/>  Who, seeing him alone in this design,<br/>Surveyed him fore and aft with eyes observant,<br/>Then asked him, "If he wished to stay as servant?"<br/><br/>And promised him an office of great ease.<br/>  But, said Orlando, "Saracen insane!<br/>I come to kill you, if it shall so please<br/>  God, not to serve as footboy in your train;<br/>You with his monks so oft have broke the peace--<br/>  Vile dog! 'tis past his patience to sustain."<br/>The Giant ran to fetch his arms, quite furious,<br/>When he received an answer so injurious.<br/><br/>And being returned to where Orlando stood,<br/>  Who had not moved him from the spot, and swinging<br/>The cord, he hurled a stone with strength so rude,<br/>  As showed a sample of his skill in slinging;<br/>It rolled on Count Orlando's helmet good<br/>  And head, and set both head and helmet ringing,<br/>So that he swooned with pain as if he died,<br/>But more than dead, he seemed so stupified.<br/><br/>Then Passamont, who thought him slain outright,<br/>  Said, "I will go, and while he lies along,<br/>Disarm me: why such craven did I fight?"<br/>  But Christ his servants ne'er abandons long,<br/>Especially Orlando, such a knight,<br/>  As to desert would almost be a wrong.<br/>While the giant goes to put off his defences,<br/>Orlando has recalled his force and senses:<br/><br/>And loud he shouted, "Giant, where dost go?<br/>  Thou thought'st me doubtless for the bier outlaid;<br/>To the right about--without wings thou'rt too slow<br/>  To fly my vengeance--currish renegade!<br/>'Twas but by treachery thou laid'st me low."<br/>  The giant his astonishment betrayed,<br/>And turned about, and stopped his journey on,<br/>And then he stooped to pick up a great stone.<br/><br/>Orlando had Cortana bare in hand;<br/>  To split the head in twain was what he schemed:<br/>Cortana clave the skull like a true brand,<br/>  And pagan Passamont died unredeemed;<br/>Yet harsh and haughty, as he lay he banned,<br/>  And most devoutly Macon still blasphemed;<br/>But while his crude, rude blasphemies he heard,<br/>Orlando thanked the Father and the Word,--<br/><br/>Saying, "What grace to me thou'st this day given!<br/>  And I to thee, O Lord! am ever bound;<br/>I know my life was saved by thee from Heaven,<br/>  Since by the Giant I was fairly downed.<br/>All things by thee are measured just and even;<br/>  Our power without thine aid would nought be found:<br/>I pray thee take heed of me, till I can<br/>At least return once more to Carloman."<br/><br/>And having said thus much, he went his way;<br/>  And Alabaster he found out below,<br/>Doing the very best that in him lay<br/>  To root from out a bank a rock or two.<br/>Orlando, when he reached him, loud 'gan say,<br/>  "How think'st thou, glutton, such a stone to throw?"<br/>When Alabaster heard his deep voice ring,<br/>He suddenly betook him to his sling,<br/><br/>And hurled a fragment of a size so large<br/>  That if it had in fact fulfilled its mission,<br/>And Roland not availed him of his targe,<br/>  There would have been no need of a physician.<br/>Orlando set himself in turn to charge,<br/>  And in his bulky bosom made incision<br/>With all his sword. The lout fell; but o'erthrown, he<br/>However by no means forgot Macone.<br/><br/>Morgante had a palace in his mode,<br/>  Composed of branches, logs of wood, and earth,<br/>And stretched himself at ease in this abode,<br/>  And shut himself at night within his berth.<br/>Orlando knocked, and knocked again, to goad<br/>  The giant from his sleep; and he came forth,<br/>The door to open, like a crazy thing,<br/>For a rough dream had shook him slumbering.<br/><br/>He thought that a fierce serpent had attacked him,<br/>  And Mahomet he called; but Mahomet<br/>Is nothing worth, and, not an instant backed him;<br/>  But praying blessed Jesu, he was set<br/>At liberty from all the fears which racked him;<br/>  And to the gate he came with great regret--<br/>"Who knocks here?" grumbling all the while, said he.<br/>"That," said Orlando, "you will quickly see:<br/><br/>"I come to preach to you, as to your brothers,--<br/>  Sent by the miserable monks--repentance;<br/>For Providence divine, in you and others,<br/>  Condemns the evil done, my new acquaintance!<br/>'Tis writ on high--your wrong must pay another's:<br/>  From Heaven itself is issued out this sentence.<br/>Know then, that colder now than a pilaster<br/>I left your Passamont and Alabaster."<br/><br/>Morgante said, "Oh gentle Cavalier!<br/>  Now by thy God say me no villany;<br/>The favour of your name I fain would hear,<br/>  And if a Christian, speak for courtesy."<br/>Replied Orlando, "So much to your ear<br/>  I by my faith disclose contentedly;<br/>Christ I adore, who is the genuine Lord,<br/>And, if you please, by you may be adored."<br/><br/>The Saracen rejoined in humble tone,<br/>  "I have had an extraordinary vision;<br/>A savage serpent fell on me alone,<br/>  And Macon would not pity my condition;<br/>Hence to thy God, who for ye did atone<br/>  Upon the cross, preferred I my petition;<br/>His timely succour set me safe and free,<br/>And I a Christian am disposed to be."<br/><br/>Orlando answered, "Baron just and pious,<br/>  If this good wish your heart can really move<br/>To the true God, who will not then deny us<br/>  Eternal honour, you will go above,<br/>And, if you please, as friends we will ally us,<br/>  And I will love you with a perfect love.<br/>Your idols are vain liars, full of fraud:<br/>The only true God is the Christian's God.<br/><br/>"The Lord descended to the virgin breast<br/>  Of Mary Mother, sinless and divine;<br/>If you acknowledge the Redeemer blest,<br/>  Without whom neither sun nor star can shine,<br/>Abjure bad Macon's false and felon test,<br/>  Your renegado god, and worship mine,<br/>Baptize yourself with zeal, since you repent."<br/>To which Morgante answered, "I'm content."<br/><br/>And then Orlando to embrace him flew,<br/>  And made much of his convert, as he cried,<br/>"To the abbey I will gladly marshal you."<br/>  To whom Morgante, "Let us go," replied:<br/>"I to the friars have for peace to sue."<br/>  Which thing Orlando heard with inward pride,<br/>Saying, "My brother, so devout and good,<br/>Ask the Abbot pardon, as I wish you would:<br/><br/>"Since God has granted your illumination,<br/>  Accepting you in mercy for his own,<br/>Humility should be your first oblation."<br/>  Morgante said, "For goodness' sake, make known,--<br/>Since that your God is to be mine--your station,<br/>  And let your name in verity be shown;<br/>Then will I everything at your command do."<br/>On which the other said, he was Orlando.<br/><br/>"Then," quoth the Giant, "blessed be Jesu<br/>  A thousand times with gratitude and praise!<br/>Oft, perfect Baron! have I heard of you<br/>  Through all the different periods of my days:<br/>And, as I said, to be your vassal too<br/>  I wish, for your great gallantry always."<br/>Thus reasoning, they continued much to say,<br/>And onwards to the abbey went their way.<br/><br/>And by the way about the giants dead<br/>  Orlando with Morgante reasoned: "Be,<br/>For their decease, I pray you, comforted,<br/>  And, since it is God's pleasure, pardon me;<br/>A thousand wrongs unto the monks they bred;<br/>  And our true Scripture soundeth openly,<br/>Good is rewarded, and chastised the ill,<br/>Which the Lord never faileth to fulfil:<br/><br/>"Because His love of justice unto all<br/>  Is such, He wills His judgment should devour<br/>All who have sin, however great or small;<br/>  But good He well remembers to restore.<br/>Nor without justice holy could we call<br/>  Him, whom I now require you to adore.<br/>All men must make His will their wishes sway,<br/>And quickly and spontaneously obey.<br/><br/>"And here our doctors are of one accord,<br/>  Coming on this point to the same conclusion,--<br/>That in their thoughts, who praise in Heaven the Lord,<br/>  If Pity e'er was guilty of intrusion<br/>For their unfortunate relations stored<br/>  In Hell below, and damned in great confusion,<br/>Their happiness would be reduced to nought,--<br/>And thus unjust the Almighty's self be thought.<br/><br/>"But they in Christ have firmest hope, and all<br/>  Which seems to Him, to them too must appear<br/>Well done; nor could it otherwise befall;<br/>  He never can in any purpose err.<br/>If sire or mother suffer endless thrall,<br/>  They don't disturb themselves for him or her:<br/>What pleases God to them must joy inspire;--<br/>Such is the observance of the eternal choir."<br/><br/>"A word unto the wise," Morgante said,<br/>  "Is wont to be enough, and you shall see<br/>How much I grieve about my brethren dead;<br/>  And if the will of God seem good to me,<br/>Just, as you tell me, 'tis in Heaven obeyed--<br/>  Ashes to ashes,--merry let us be!<br/>I will cut off the hands from both their trunks,<br/>And carry them unto the holy monks.<br/><br/>"So that all persons may be sure and certain<br/>  That they are dead, and have no further fear<br/>To wander solitary this desert in,<br/>  And that they may perceive my spirit clear<br/>By the Lord's grace, who hath withdrawn the curtain<br/>  Of darkness, making His bright realm appear."<br/>He cut his brethren's hands off at these words,<br/>And left them to the savage beasts and birds.<br/><br/>Then to the abbey they went on together,<br/>  Where waited them the Abbot in great doubt.<br/>The monks, who knew not yet the fact, ran thither<br/>  To their superior, all in breathless rout,<br/>Saying with tremor, "Please to tell us whether<br/>  You wish to have this person in or out?"<br/>The Abbot, looking through upon the Giant,<br/>Too greatly feared, at first, to be compliant.<br/><br/>Orlando seeing him thus agitated,<br/>  Said quickly, "Abbot, be thou of good cheer;<br/>He Christ believes, as Christian must be rated,<br/>  And hath renounced his Macon false;" which here<br/>Morgante with the hands corroborated,<br/>  A proof of both the giants' fate quite clear:<br/>Thence, with due thanks, the Abbot God adored,<br/>Saying, "Thou hast contented me, O Lord!"<br/><br/>He gazed; Morgante's height he calculated,<br/>  And more than once contemplated his size;<br/>And then he said, "O Giant celebrated!<br/>  Know, that no more my wonder will arise,<br/>How you could tear and fling the trees you late did,<br/>  When I behold your form with my own eyes.<br/>You now a true and perfect friend will show<br/>Yourself to Christ, as once you were a foe.<br/><br/>"And one of our apostles, Saul once named,<br/>  Long persecuted sore the faith of Christ,<br/>Till, one day, by the Spirit being inflamed,<br/>  'Why dost thou persecute me thus?' said Christ;<br/>And then from his offence he was reclaimed,<br/>  And went for ever after preaching Christ,<br/>And of the faith became a trump, whose sounding<br/>O'er the whole earth is echoing and rebounding.<br/><br/>"So, my Morgante, you may do likewise:<br/>  He who repents--thus writes the Evangelist--<br/>Occasions more rejoicing in the skies<br/>  Than ninety-nine of the celestial list.<br/>You may be sure, should each desire arise<br/>  With just zeal for the Lord, that you'll exist<br/>Among the happy saints for evermore;<br/>But you were lost and damned to Hell before!"<br/><br/>And thus great honour to Morgante paid<br/>  The Abbot: many days they did repose.<br/>One day, as with Orlando they both strayed,<br/>  And sauntered here and there, where'er they chose,<br/>The Abbot showed a chamber, where arrayed<br/>  Much armour was, and hung up certain bows;<br/>And one of these Morgante for a whim<br/>Girt on, though useless, he believed, to him.<br/><br/>There being a want of water in the place,<br/>  Orlando, like a worthy brother, said,<br/>"Morgante, I could wish you in this case<br/>  To go for water." "You shall be obeyed<br/>In all commands," was the reply, "straight ways."<br/>  Upon his shoulder a great tub he laid,<br/>And went out on his way unto a fountain,<br/>Where he was wont to drink, below the mountain.<br/><br/>Arrived there, a prodigious noise he hears,<br/>  Which suddenly along the forest spread;<br/>Whereat from out his quiver he prepares<br/>  An arrow for his bow, and lifts his head;<br/>And lo! a monstrous herd of swine appears,<br/>  And onward rushes with tempestuous tread,<br/>And to the fountain's brink precisely pours;<br/>So that the Giant's joined by all the boars.<br/><br/>Morgante at a venture shot an arrow,<br/>  Which pierced a pig precisely in the ear,<br/>And passed unto the other side quite through;<br/>  So that the boar, defunct, lay tripped up near.<br/>Another, to revenge his fellow farrow,<br/>  Against the Giant rushed in fierce career,<br/>And reached the passage with so swift a foot,<br/>Morgante was not now in time to shoot.<br/><br/>Perceiving that the pig was on him close,<br/>  He gave him such a punch upon the head,<br/>As floored him so that he no more arose,<br/>  Smashing the very bone; and he fell dead<br/>Next to the other. Having seen such blows,<br/>  The other pigs along the valley fled;<br/>Morgante on his neck the bucket took,<br/>Full from the spring, which neither swerved nor shook.<br/><br/>The tub was on one shoulder, and there were<br/>  The hogs on t'other, and he brushed apace<br/>On to the abbey, though by no means near,<br/>  Nor spilt one drop of water in his race.<br/>Orlando, seeing him so soon appear<br/>  With the dead boars, and with that brimful vase,<br/>Marvelled to see his strength so very great;<br/>So did the Abbot, and set wide the gate.<br/><br/>The monks, who saw the water fresh and good,<br/>  Rejoiced, but much more to perceive the pork;<br/>All animals are glad at sight of food:<br/>  They lay their breviaries to sleep, and work<br/>With greedy pleasure, and in such a mood,<br/>  That the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork.<br/>Of rankness and of rot there is no fear,<br/>For all the fasts are now left in arrear.<br/><br/>As though they wished to burst at once, they ate;<br/>  And gorged so that, as if the bones had been<br/>In water, sorely grieved the dog and cat,<br/>  Perceiving that they all were picked too clean.<br/>The Abbot, who to all did honour great,<br/>  A few days after this convivial scene,<br/>Gave to Morgante a fine horse, well trained,<br/>Which he long time had for himself maintained.<br/><br/>The horse Morgante to a meadow led,<br/>  To gallop, and to put him to the proof,<br/>Thinking that he a back of iron had,<br/>  Or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough;<br/>But the horse, sinking with the pain, fell dead,<br/>  And burst, while cold on earth lay head and hoof.<br/>Morgante said, "Get up, thou sulky cur!"<br/>And still continued pricking with the spur.<br/><br/>But finally he thought fit to dismount,<br/>  And said, "I am as light as any feather,<br/>And he has burst;--to this what say you, Count?"<br/>  Orlando answered, "Like a ship's mast rather<br/>You seem to me, and with the truck for front:<br/>  Let him go! Fortune wills that we together<br/>Should march, but you on foot Morgante still."<br/>To which the Giant answered," So I will.<br/><br/>"When there shall be occasion, you will see<br/>  How I approve my courage in the fight."<br/>Orlando said, "I really think you'll be,<br/>  If it should prove God's will, a goodly knight;<br/>Nor will you napping there discover me.<br/>  But never mind your horse, though out of sight<br/>'Twere best to carry him into some wood,<br/>If but the means or way I understood."<br/><br/>The Giant said, "Then carry him I will,<br/>  Since that to carry me he was so slack--<br/>To render, as the gods do, good for ill;<br/>  But lend a hand to place him on my back."<br/>Orlando answered, "If my counsel still<br/>  May weigh, Morgante, do not undertake<br/>To lift or carry this dead courser, who,<br/>As you have done to him, will do to you.<br/><br/>"Take care he don't revenge himself, though dead,<br/>  As Nessus did of old beyond all cure.<br/>I don't know if the fact you've heard or read;<br/>  But he will make you burst, you may be sure."<br/>"But help him on my back," Morgante said,<br/>  "And you shall see what weight I can endure.<br/>In place, my gentle Roland, of this palfrey,<br/>With all the bells, I'd carry yonder belfry."<br/><br/>The Abbot said, "The steeple may do well,<br/>  But for the bells, you've broken them, I wot."<br/>Morgante answered, "Let them pay in Hell<br/>  The penalty who lie dead in yon grot;"<br/>And hoisting up the horse from where he fell,<br/>  He said, "Now look if I the gout have got,<br/>Orlando, in the legs,--or if I have force;"--<br/>And then he made two gambols with the horse.<br/><br/>Morgante was like any mountain framed;<br/>  So if he did this 'tis no prodigy;<br/>But secretly himself Orlando blamed,<br/>  Because he was one of his family;<br/>And fearing that he might be hurt or maimed,<br/>  Once more he bade him lay his burden by:<br/>"Put down, nor bear him further the desert in."<br/>Morgante said, "I'll carry him for certain."<br/><br/>He did; and stowed him in some nook away,<br/>  And to the abbey then returned with speed.<br/>Orlando said, "Why longer do we stay?<br/>  Morgante, here is nought to do indeed."<br/>The Abbot by the hand he took one day,<br/>  And said, with great respect, he had agreed<br/>To leave his reverence; but for this decision<br/>He wished to have his pardon and permission.<br/><br/>The honours they continued to receive<br/>  Perhaps exceeded what his merits claimed:<br/>He said, "I mean, and quickly, to retrieve<br/>  The lost days of time past, which may be blamed;<br/>Some days ago I should have asked your leave,<br/>  Kind father, but I really was ashamed,<br/>And know not how to show my sentiment,<br/>So much I see you with our stay content.<br/><br/>"But in my heart I bear through every clime<br/>  The Abbot, abbey, and this solitude--<br/>So much I love you in so short a time;<br/>  For me, from Heaven reward you with all good<br/>The God so true, the eternal Lord sublime!<br/>  Whose kingdom at the last hath open stood.<br/>Meantime we stand expectant of your blessing.<br/>And recommend us to your prayers with pressing."<br/><br/>Now when the Abbot Count Orlando heard,<br/>  His heart grew soft with inner tenderness,<br/>Such fervour in his bosom bred each word;<br/>  And, "Cavalier," he said, "if I have less<br/>Courteous and kind to your great worth appeared,<br/>  Than fits me for such gentle blood to express,<br/>I know I have done too little in this case;<br/>But blame our ignorance, and this poor place.<br/><br/>"We can indeed but honour you with masses,<br/>  And sermons, thanksgivings, and pater-nosters,<br/>Hot suppers, dinners (fitting other places<br/>  In verity much rather than the cloisters);<br/>But such a love for you my heart embraces,<br/>  For thousand virtues which your bosom fosters,<br/>That wheresoe'er you go I too shall be,<br/>And, on the other part, you rest with me.<br/><br/>"This may involve a seeming contradiction;<br/>  But you I know are sage, and feel, and taste,<br/>And understand my speech with full conviction.<br/>  For your just pious deeds may you be graced<br/>With the Lord's great reward and benediction,<br/>  By whom you were directed to this waste:<br/>To His high mercy is our freedom due,<br/>For which we render thanks to Him and you.<br/><br/>"You saved at once our life and soul: such fear<br/>  The Giants caused us, that the way was lost<br/>By which we could pursue a fit career<br/>  In search of Jesus and the saintly Host;<br/>And your departure breeds such sorrow here,<br/>  That comfortless we all are to our cost;<br/>But months and years you would not stay in sloth,<br/>Nor are you formed to wear our sober cloth,<br/><br/>"But to bear arms, and wield the lance; indeed,<br/>  With these as much is done as with this cowl;<br/>In proof of which the Scripture you may read,<br/>  This Giant up to Heaven may bear his soul<br/>By your compassion: now in peace proceed.<br/>  Your state and name I seek not to unroll;<br/>But, if I'm asked, this answer shall be given,<br/>That here an angel was sent down from Heaven.<br/><br/>"If you want armour or aught else, go in,<br/>  Look o'er the wardrobe, and take what you choose,<br/>And cover with it o'er this Giant's skin."<br/>  Orlando answered, "If there should lie loose<br/>Some armour, ere our journey we begin,<br/>  Which might be turned to my companion's use,<br/>The gift would be acceptable to me."<br/>The Abbot said to him, "Come in and see."<br/><br/>And in a certain closet, where the wall<br/>  Was covered with old armour like a crust,<br/>The Abbot said to them, "I give you all."<br/>  Morgante rummaged piecemeal from the dust<br/>The whole, which, save one cuirass, was too small,<br/>  And that too had the mail inlaid with rust.<br/>They wondered how it fitted him exactly,<br/>Which ne'er had suited others so compactly.<br/><br/>'Twas an immeasurable Giant's, who<br/>  By the great Milo of Agrante fell<br/>Before the abbey many years ago.<br/>  The story on the wall was figured well;<br/>In the last moment of the abbey's foe,<br/>  Who long had waged a war implacable:<br/>Precisely as the war occurred they drew him,<br/>And there was Milo as he overthrew him.<br/><br/>Seeing this history, Count Orlando said<br/>  In his own heart, "O God who in the sky<br/>Know'st all things! how was Milo hither led?<br/>  Who caused the Giant in this place to die?"<br/>And certain letters, weeping, then he read,<br/>  So that he could not keep his visage dry,--<br/>As I will tell in the ensuing story:<br/>From evil keep you the high King of Glory!
