# üíÆ Homer's Hymn to Venus by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    [VERSES 1-55, WITH SOME OMISSIONS.]<br/><br/>Muse, sing the deeds of golden Aphrodite,<br/>Who wakens with her smile the lulled delight<br/>Of sweet desire, taming the eternal kings<br/>Of Heaven, and men, and all the living things<br/>That fleet along the air, or whom the sea,<br/>Or earth, with her maternal ministry,<br/>Nourish innumerable, thy delight<br/>All seek ... O crowned Aphrodite!<br/>Three spirits canst thou not deceive or quell:--<br/>Minerva, child of Jove, who loves too well<br/>Fierce war and mingling combat, and the fame<br/>Of glorious deeds, to heed thy gentle flame.<br/>Diana ... golden-shafted queen,<br/>Is tamed not by thy smiles; the shadows green<br/>Of the wild woods, the bow, the...<br/>And piercing cries amid the swift pursuit<br/>Of beasts among waste mountains,--such delight<br/>Is hers, and men who know and do the right.<br/>Nor Saturn's first-born daughter, Vesta chaste,<br/>Whom Neptune and Apollo wooed the last,<br/>Such was the will of aegis-bearing Jove;<br/>But sternly she refused the ills of Love,<br/>And by her mighty Father's head she swore<br/>An oath not unperformed, that evermore<br/>A virgin she would live mid deities<br/>Divine: her father, for such gentle ties<br/>Renounced, gave glorious gifts--thus in his hall<br/>She sits and feeds luxuriously. O'er all<br/>In every fane, her honours first arise<br/>From men--the eldest of Divinities.<br/><br/>These spirits she persuades not, nor deceives,<br/>But none beside escape, so well she weaves<br/>Her unseen toils; nor mortal men, nor gods<br/>Who live secure in their unseen abodes.<br/>She won the soul of him whose fierce delight<br/>Is thunder--first in glory and in might.<br/>And, as she willed, his mighty mind deceiving,<br/>With mortal limbs his deathless limbs inweaving,<br/>Concealed him from his spouse and sister fair,<br/>Whom to wise Saturn ancient Rhea bare.<br/>but in return,<br/>In Venus Jove did soft desire awaken,<br/>That by her own enchantments overtaken,<br/>She might, no more from human union free,<br/>Burn for a nursling of mortality.<br/>For once amid the assembled Deities,<br/>The laughter-loving Venus from her eyes<br/><br/>Shot forth the light of a soft starlight smile,<br/>And boasting said, that she, secure the while,<br/>Could bring at Will to the assembled Gods<br/>The mortal tenants of earth's dark abodes,<br/>And mortal offspring from a deathless stem<br/>She could produce in scorn and spite of them.<br/>Therefore he poured desire into her breast<br/>Of young Anchises,<br/>Feeding his herds among the mossy fountains<br/>Of the wide Ida's many-folded mountains,--<br/>Whom Venus saw, and loved, and the love clung<br/>Like wasting fire her senses wild among.
