# üíÆ An Hymn Of Heavenly Beauty by *Edmund Spenser*

<p>
    Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,<br/>Through contemplation of those goodly sights,<br/>And glorious images in heaven wrought,<br/>Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights<br/>Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;<br/>I fain to tell the things that I behold,<br/>But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.<br/><br/>Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,<br/>From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,<br/>To shed into my breast some sparkling light<br/>Of thine eternal truth, that I may show<br/>Some little beams to mortal eyes below<br/>Of that immortal beauty, there with thee,<br/>Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;<br/><br/>That with the glory of so goodly sight<br/>The hearts of men, which fondly here admire<br/>Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,<br/>Transported with celestial desire<br/>Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,<br/>And learn to love, with zealous humble duty,<br/>Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.<br/><br/>Beginning then below, with th' easy view<br/>Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye,<br/>From thence to mount aloft, by order due,<br/>To contemplation of th' immortal sky;<br/>Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly,<br/>That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,<br/>Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.<br/><br/>Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed<br/>With sight of that is fair, look on the frame<br/>Of this wide universe, and therein reed<br/>The endless kinds of creatures which by name<br/>Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim;<br/>All which are made with wondrous wise respect,<br/>And all with admirable beauty deckt.<br/><br/>First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,<br/>Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;<br/>Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded<br/>On every side, with piles of flaming brands,<br/>Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;<br/>And last, that mighty shining crystal wall,<br/>Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.<br/><br/>By view whereof it plainly may appear,<br/>That still as every thing doth upward tend,<br/>And further is from earth, so still more clear<br/>And fair it grows, till to his perfect end<br/>Of purest beauty it at last ascend;<br/>Air more than water, fire much more than air,<br/>And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.<br/><br/>Look thou no further, but affix thine eye<br/>On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,<br/>The house of blessed gods, which men call sky,<br/>All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,<br/>Whereof each other doth in brightness pass,<br/>But those two most, which ruling night and day,<br/>As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;<br/><br/>And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen<br/>That to their beauty may compared be,<br/>Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen<br/>Endure their captain's flaming head to see?<br/>How much less those, much higher in degree,<br/>And so much fairer, and much more than these,<br/>As these are fairer than the land and seas?<br/><br/>For far above these heavens, which here we see,<br/>Be others far exceeding these in light,<br/>Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,<br/>But infinite in largeness and in height,<br/>Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,<br/>That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,<br/>But their own native light far passing theirs.<br/><br/>And as these heavens still by degrees arise,<br/>Until they come to their first Mover's bound,<br/>That in his mighty compass doth comprise,<br/>And carry all the rest with him around;<br/>So those likewise do by degrees redound,<br/>And rise more fair; till they at last arrive<br/>To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.<br/><br/>Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place,<br/>In full enjoyment of felicity,<br/>Whence they do still behold the glorious face<br/>Of the divine eternal Majesty;<br/>More fair is that, where those Ideas on high<br/>Enranged be, which Plato so admired,<br/>And pure Intelligences from God inspired.<br/><br/>Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign<br/>The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,<br/>Which in their high protections do contain<br/>All mortal princes and imperial states;<br/>And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats<br/>And heavenly Dominations are set,<br/>From whom all earthly governance is fet.<br/><br/>Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,<br/>Which all with golden wings are overdight,<br/>And those eternal burning Seraphins,<br/>Which from their faces dart out fiery light;<br/>Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright,<br/>Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend<br/>On God's own person, without rest or end.<br/><br/>These thus in fair each other far excelling,<br/>As to the highest they approach more near,<br/>Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,<br/>Fairer than all the rest which there appear,<br/>Though all their beauties join'd together were;<br/>How then can mortal tongue hope to express<br/>The image of such endless perfectness?<br/><br/>Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind<br/>Leave to bethink how great that beauty is,<br/>Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;<br/>How much more those essential parts of his,<br/>His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,<br/>His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,<br/>By which he lends us of himself a sight.<br/><br/>Those unto all he daily doth display,<br/>And shew himself in th' image of his grace,<br/>As in a looking-glass, through which he may<br/>Be seen of all his creatures vile and base,<br/>That are unable else to see his face,<br/>His glorious face which glistereth else so bright,<br/>That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.<br/><br/>But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain<br/>The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,<br/>But that their points rebutted back again<br/>Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne<br/>The glory of that Majesty Divine,<br/>In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,<br/>Compared to his least resplendent spark?<br/><br/>The means, therefore, which unto us is lent<br/>Him to behold, is on his works to look,<br/>Which he hath made in beauty excellent,<br/>And in the same, as in a brazen book,<br/>To read enregister'd in every nook<br/>His goodness, which his beauty doth declare;<br/>For all that's good is beautiful and fair.<br/><br/>Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,<br/>To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,<br/>Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,<br/>From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,<br/>And, like the native brood of eagles' kind,<br/>On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,<br/>Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.<br/><br/>Humbled with fear and awful reverence,<br/>Before the footstool of his majesty<br/>Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence,<br/>Ne dare look up with corruptible eye<br/>On the dread face of that great Deity,<br/>For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,<br/>Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.<br/><br/>But lowly fall before his mercy seat,<br/>Close covered with the Lamb's integrity<br/>From the just wrath of his avengeful threat<br/>That sits upon the righteous throne on high;<br/>His throne is built upon eternity,<br/>More firm and durable than steel or brass,<br/>Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.<br/><br/>His sceptre is the rod of righteousness,<br/>With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,<br/>And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,<br/>Under the rigour of his judgement just;<br/>His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,<br/>From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright<br/>That all about him sheddeth glorious light:<br/><br/>Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark<br/>Which darted is from Titan's flaming head,<br/>That with his beams enlumineth the dark<br/>And dampish air, whereby all things are read;<br/>Whose nature yet so much is marvelled<br/>Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze<br/>The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.<br/><br/>But that immortal light, which there doth shine,<br/>Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,<br/>More excellent, more glorious, more divine,<br/>Through which to God all mortal actions here,<br/>And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;<br/>For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,<br/>Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.<br/><br/>With the great glory of that wondrous light<br/>His throne is all encompassed around,<br/>And hid in his own brightness from the sight<br/>Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;<br/>And underneath his feet are to be found<br/>Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,<br/>The instruments of his avenging ire.<br/><br/>There in his bosom Sapience doth sit,<br/>The sovereign darling of the Deity,<br/>Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit<br/>For so great power and peerless majesty,<br/>And all with gems and jewels gorgeously<br/>Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,<br/>And make her native brightness seem more clear.<br/><br/>And on her head a crown of purest gold<br/>Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty;<br/>And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,<br/>With which she rules the house of God on high,<br/>And manageth the ever-moving sky,<br/>And in the same these lower creatures all<br/>Subjected to her power imperial.<br/><br/>Both heaven and earth obey unto her will,<br/>And all the creatures which they both contain;<br/>For of her fullness which the world doth fill<br/>They all partake, and do in state remain<br/>As their great Maker did at first ordain,<br/>Through observation of her high behest,<br/>By which they first were made, and still increast.<br/><br/>The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;<br/>For she the daughters of all women's race,<br/>And angels eke, in beauty doth excel,<br/>Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face,<br/>And more increas'd by her own goodly grace,<br/>That it doth far exceed all human thought,<br/>Ne can on earth compared be to aught.<br/><br/>Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)<br/>Which pictured Venus with so curious quill,<br/>That all posterity admired it,<br/>Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;<br/>Ne she herself, had she remained still,<br/>And were as fair as fabling wits do feign,<br/>Could once come near this beauty sovereign.<br/><br/>But had those wits, the wonders of their days,<br/>Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend<br/>His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,<br/>Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,<br/>How wondrously would he her face commend,<br/>Above that idol of his feigning thought,<br/>That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.<br/><br/>How then dare I, the novice of his art,<br/>Presume to picture so divine a wight,<br/>Or hope t' express her least perfection's part,<br/>Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light,<br/>And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?<br/>Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint<br/>The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.<br/><br/>Let angels, which her goodly face behold<br/>And see at will, her sovereign praises sing,<br/>And those most sacred mysteries unfold<br/>Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;<br/>Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,<br/>And being thus with her huge love possest,<br/>In th' only wonder of herself to rest.<br/><br/>But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,<br/>Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace<br/>And lets his own beloved to behold;<br/>For in the view of her celestial face<br/>All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;<br/>Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight<br/>Who of herself can win the wishful sight.<br/><br/>For she, out of her secret treasury,<br/>Plenty of riches forth on him will pour,<br/>Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie<br/>Within the closet of her chastest bower,<br/>Th' eternal portion of her precious dower,<br/>Which mighty God hath given to her free,<br/>And to all those which thereof worthy be.<br/><br/>None thereof worthy be, but those whom she<br/>Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,<br/>And letteth them her lovely face to see,<br/>Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,<br/>And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave<br/>Their soul of sense, through infinite delight,<br/>And them transport from flesh into the spright.<br/><br/>In which they see such admirable things,<br/>As carries them into an ecstasy,<br/>And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings<br/>Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;<br/>And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,<br/>That maketh them all worldly cares forget,<br/>And only think on that before them set.<br/><br/>Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,<br/>Or idle thought of earthly things, remain;<br/>But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,<br/>And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;<br/>Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,<br/>Is fixed all on that which now they see;<br/>All other sights but feigned shadows be.<br/><br/>And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame<br/>The hearts of men with self-consuming fire<br/>Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;<br/>And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire<br/>By name of honour, and so much desire,<br/>Seems to them baseness, and all riches dross,<br/>And all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.<br/><br/>So full their eyes are of that glorious sight,<br/>And senses fraught with such satiety,<br/>That in nought else on earth they can delight,<br/>But in th' aspect of that felicity,<br/>Which they have written in their inward eye;<br/>On which they feed, and in their fastened mind<br/>All happy joy and full contentment find.<br/><br/>Ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed<br/>On idle fancies of thy foolish thought,<br/>And, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,<br/>Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought,<br/>Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought<br/>But late repentance through thy follies prief;<br/>Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:<br/><br/>And look at last up to that sovereign light,<br/>From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,<br/>That kindleth love in every godly sprite,<br/>Even the love of God, which loathing brings<br/>Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;<br/>With whose sweet pleasures being so possest,<br/>Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.
