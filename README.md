# üíÆ Satire II. to Mr Bethel. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    SATIRES AND EPISTLES OF HORACE IMITATED.<br/><br/>What, and how great, the virtue and the art<br/>To live on little with a cheerful heart;<br/>(A doctrine sage, but truly none of mine)<br/>Let's talk, my friends, but talk before we dine;<br/>Not when a gilt buffet's reflected pride<br/>Turns you from sound philosophy aside;<br/>Not when from plate to plate your eyeballs roll,<br/>And the brain dances to the mantling bowl.<br/><br/>Hear Bethel's sermon, one not versed in schools,<br/>But strong in sense, and wise without the rules.<br/><br/>Go, work, hunt, exercise! (he thus began)<br/>Then scorn a homely dinner, if you can.<br/>Your wine lock'd up, your butler stroll'd abroad,<br/>Or fish denied (the river yet unthaw'd),<br/>If then plain bread and milk will do the feat,<br/>The pleasure lies in you, and not the meat.<br/><br/>Preach as I please, I doubt our curious men<br/>Will choose a pheasant still before a hen;<br/>Yet hens of Guinea full as good I hold,<br/>Except you eat the feathers green and gold.<br/>Of carps and mullets why prefer the great,<br/>(Though cut in pieces ere my lord can eat)<br/>Yet for small turbots such esteem profess?<br/>Because God made these large, the other less.<br/><br/>Oldfield, with more than harpy throat endued,<br/>Cries, 'Send me, gods! a whole hog barbecued!'<br/>Oh, blast it, south-winds! till a stench exhale<br/>Rank as the ripeness of a rabbit's tail.<br/>By what criterion do ye eat, d' ye think,<br/>If this is prized for sweetness, that for stink?<br/>When the tired glutton labours through a treat,<br/>He finds no relish in the sweetest meat,<br/>He calls for something bitter, something sour,<br/>And the rich feast concludes extremely poor:<br/>Cheap eggs, and herbs, and olives still we see;<br/>Thus much is left of old simplicity!<br/><br/>The robin redbreast till of late had rest,<br/>And children sacred held a martin's nest,<br/>Till beccaficos sold so devilish dear<br/>To one that was, or would have been, a peer.<br/>Let me extol a cat, on oysters fed,<br/>I'll have a party at the Bedford-head;<br/>Or even to crack live crawfish recommend;<br/>I'd never doubt at court to make a friend.<br/><br/>'Tis yet in vain, I own, to keep a pother<br/>About one vice, and fall into the other:<br/>Between excess and famine lies a mean;<br/>Plain, but not sordid; though not splendid, clean.<br/><br/>Avidien, or his wife (no matter which,<br/>For him you'll call a dog, and her a bitch)<br/>Sell their presented partridges, and fruits,<br/>And humbly live on rabbits and on roots:<br/>One half-pint bottle serves them both to dine,<br/>And is at once their vinegar and wine.<br/>But on some lucky day (as when they found<br/>A lost bank-bill, or heard their son was drown'd)<br/>At such a feast, old vinegar to spare,<br/>Is what two souls so generous cannot bear:<br/>Oil, though it stink, they drop by drop impart,<br/>But souse the cabbage with a bounteous heart.<br/><br/>He knows to live, who keeps the middle state,<br/>And neither leans on this side, nor on that;<br/>Nor stops, for one bad cork, his butler's pay;<br/>Swears, like Albutius, a good cook away;<br/>Nor lets, like Naevius, every error pass,<br/>The musty wine, foul cloth, or greasy glass.<br/>Now hear what blessings temperance can bring:<br/>(Thus said our friend, and what he said I sing)<br/>First health: the stomach (cramm'd from every dish,<br/>A tomb of boil'd and roast, and flesh and fish,<br/>Where bile, and wind, and phlegm, and acid jar,<br/>And all the man is one intestine war)<br/>Remembers oft the school-boy's simple fare,<br/>The temperate sleeps, and spirits light as air.<br/><br/>How pale each worshipful and reverend guest<br/>Rise from a clergy or a city feast!<br/>What life in all that ample body, say?<br/>What heavenly particle inspires the clay?<br/>The soul subsides, and wickedly inclines<br/>To seem but mortal, even in sound divines.<br/><br/>On morning wings how active springs the mind<br/>That leaves the load of yesterday behind!<br/>How easy every labour it pursues!<br/>How coming to the poet every Muse!<br/>Not but we may exceed some holy time,<br/>Or tired in search of truth, or search of rhyme;<br/>Ill health some just indulgence may engage,<br/>And more the sickness of long life, old age;<br/>For fainting age what cordial drop remains,<br/>If our intemperate youth the vessel drains?<br/><br/>Our fathers praised rank ven'son. You suppose,<br/>Perhaps, young men! our fathers had no nose.<br/>Not so: a buck was then a week's repast,<br/>And 'twas their point, I ween, to make it last;<br/>More pleased to keep it till their friends could come,<br/>Than eat the sweetest by themselves at home.<br/>Why had not I in those good times my birth,<br/>Ere coxcomb-pies or coxcombs were on earth?<br/><br/>Unworthy he, the voice of fame to hear--<br/>That sweetest music to an honest ear--<br/>(For, faith! Lord Fanny, you are in the wrong,<br/>The world's good word is better than a song,)<br/>Who has not learn'd, fresh sturgeon and ham-pie<br/>Are no rewards for want, and infamy!<br/>When luxury has lick'd up all thy pelf,<br/>Cursed by thy neighbours, thy trustees, thyself,<br/>To friends, to fortune, to mankind a shame,<br/>Think how posterity will treat thy name;<br/>And buy a rope, that future times may tell<br/>Thou hast at least bestow'd one penny well.<br/><br/>'Right,' cries his lordship, 'for a rogue in need<br/>To have a taste is insolence indeed:<br/>In me 'tis noble, suits my birth and state,<br/>My wealth unwieldy, and my heap too great.'<br/>Then, like the sun, let bounty spread her ray,<br/>And shine that superfluity away.<br/>Oh, impudence of wealth! with all thy store,<br/>How dar'st thou let one worthy man be poor?<br/>Shall half the new-built churches round thee fall?<br/>Make quays, build bridges, or repair Whitehall:<br/>Or to thy country let that heap be lent,<br/>As Marlbro's was, but not at five per cent.<br/><br/>Who thinks that Fortune cannot change her mind,<br/>Prepares a dreadful jest for all mankind.<br/>And who stands safest? tell me, is it he<br/>That spreads and swells in puff'd prosperity,<br/>Or, blest with little, whose preventing care<br/>In peace provides fit arms against a war?<br/><br/>Thus Bethel spoke, who always speaks his thought,<br/>And always thinks the very thing he ought:<br/>His equal mind I copy what I can,<br/>And as I love, would imitate the man.<br/>In South-sea days not happier, when surmised<br/>The lord of thousands, than if now excised;<br/>In forest planted by a father's hand,<br/>Than in five acres now of rented land.<br/>Content with little, I can piddle here<br/>On broccoli and mutton, round the year;<br/>But ancient friends (though poor, or out of play)<br/>That touch my bell, I cannot turn away.<br/>'Tis true, no turbots dignify my boards,<br/>But gudgeons, flounders, what my Thames affords:<br/>To Hounslow Heath I point, and Bansted Down,<br/>Thence comes your mutton, and these chicks my own:<br/>From yon old walnut-tree a shower shall fall;<br/>And grapes, long lingering on my only wall,<br/>And figs from standard and espalier join;<br/>The devil is in you if you cannot dine:<br/>Then cheerful healths (your mistress shall have place)  150<br/>And, what's more rare, a poet shall say grace.<br/><br/>Fortune not much of humbling me can boast;<br/>Though double tax'd, how little have I lost?<br/>My life's amusements have been just the same,<br/>Before and after standing armies came.<br/>My lands are sold, my father's house is gone;<br/>I'll hire another's; is not that my own,<br/>And yours, my friends? through whose free-opening gate<br/>None comes too early, none departs too late;<br/>(For I, who hold sage Homer's rule the best,<br/>Welcome the coming, speed the going guest).<br/>'Pray Heaven it last!' (cries Swift) 'as you go on;<br/>I wish to God this house had been your own:<br/>Pity to build, without a son or wife:<br/>Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life.'<br/>Well, if the use be mine, can it concern one,<br/>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?<br/>What's property, dear Swift? You see it alter<br/>From you to me, from me to Peter Walter;<br/>Or, in a mortgage, prove a lawyer's share;<br/>Or, in a jointure, vanish from the heir;<br/>Or in pure equity (the case not clear)<br/>The Chancery takes your rents for twenty year:<br/>At best, it falls to some ungracious son,<br/>Who cries, 'My father's damn'd, and all's my own.'<br/>Shades, that to Bacon could retreat afford,<br/>Become the portion of a booby lord;<br/>And Helmsley, once proud Buckingham's delight,<br/>Slides to a scrivener or a city knight.<br/>Let lands and houses have what lords they will,<br/>Let us be fix'd, and our own masters still.<br/><br/>       *       *       *       *       *<br/><br/>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE.<br/><br/>TO LORD BOLINGBROKE.<br/><br/>St John, whose love indulged my labours past,<br/>Matures my present, and shall bound my last!<br/>Why will you break the Sabbath of my days?<br/>Now sick alike of envy and of praise.<br/>Public too long, ah, let me hide my age!<br/>See, modest Cibber now has left the stage:<br/>Our generals now, retired to their estates,<br/>Hang their old trophies o'er the garden gates,<br/>In life's cool evening satiate of applause,<br/>Nor fond of bleeding, even in Brunswick's cause.<br/><br/>A voice there is, that whispers in my ear,<br/>('Tis reason's voice, which sometimes one can hear)<br/>'Friend Pope! be prudent, let your Muse take breath,<br/>And never gallop Pegasus to death;<br/>Lest, still and stately, void of fire or force,<br/>You limp, like Blackmore on a Lord Mayor's horse.'<br/><br/>Farewell, then, verse, and love, and every toy,<br/>The rhymes and rattles of the man or boy;<br/>What right, what true, what fit we justly call,<br/>Let this be all my care--for this is all:<br/>To lay this harvest up, and hoard with haste<br/>What every day will want, and most, the last.<br/><br/>But ask not, to what doctors I apply;<br/>Sworn to no master, of no sect am I:<br/>As drives the storm, at any door I knock:<br/>And house with Montaigne now, or now with Locke.<br/>Sometimes a patriot, active in debate,<br/>Mix with the world, and battle for the state,<br/>Free as young Lyttelton, her cause pursue,<br/>Still true to virtue, and as warm as true:<br/>Sometimes with Aristippus, or St Paul,<br/>Indulge my candour, and grow all to all;<br/>Back to my native moderation slide,<br/>And win my way by yielding to the tide.<br/><br/>Long, as to him who works for debt, the day,<br/>Long as the night to her whose love's away,<br/>Long as the year's dull circle seems to run,<br/>When the brisk minor pants for twenty-one:<br/>So slow the unprofitable moments roll,<br/>That lock up all the functions of my soul;<br/>That keep me from myself; and still delay<br/>Life's instant business to a future day:<br/>That task, which, as we follow, or despise,<br/>The eldest is a fool, the youngest wise.<br/>Which done, the poorest can no wants endure;<br/>And which, not done, the richest must be poor.<br/><br/>Late as it is, I put myself to school,<br/>And feel some comfort not to be a fool.<br/>Weak though I am of limb, and short of sight,<br/>Far from a lynx, and not a giant quite;<br/>I'll do what Mead and Cheselden advise,<br/>To keep these limbs, and to preserve these eyes.<br/>Not to go back, is somewhat to advance,<br/>And men must walk at least before they dance.<br/><br/>Say, does thy blood rebel, thy bosom move<br/>With wretched avarice, or as wretched love?<br/>Know, there are words and spells which can control<br/>Between the fits this fever of the soul:<br/>Know, there are rhymes, which, fresh and fresh applied,<br/>Will cure the arrant'st puppy of his pride.<br/>Be furious, envious, slothful, mad, or drunk,<br/>Slave to a wife, or vassal to a punk,<br/>A Switz, a High-Dutch, or a Low-Dutch bear;<br/>All that we ask is but a patient ear.<br/><br/>'Tis the first virtue, vices to abhor:<br/>And the first wisdom, to be fool no more.<br/>But to the world no bugbear is so great,<br/>As want of figure, and a small estate.<br/>To either India see the merchant fly,<br/>Scared at the spectre of pale poverty!<br/>See him, with pains of body, pangs of soul,<br/>Burn through the tropic, freeze beneath the pole!<br/>Wilt thou do nothing for a nobler end,<br/>Nothing, to make philosophy thy friend?<br/>To stop thy foolish views, thy long desires,<br/>And ease thy heart of all that it admires?<br/><br/>Here, Wisdom calls: 'Seek Virtue first, be bold!<br/>As gold to silver, Virtue is to gold.'<br/>There, London's voice: 'Get money, money still!<br/>And then let virtue follow, if she will.'<br/>This, this the saving doctrine, preach'd to all,<br/>From low St James's up to high St Paul;<br/>From him whose quill stands quiver'd at his ear,<br/>To him who notches sticks at Westminster.<br/><br/>Barnard in spirit, sense, and truth abounds;<br/>'Pray then, what wants he?' Fourscore thousand pounds;<br/>A pension, or such harness for a slave<br/>As Bug now has, and Dorimant would have.<br/>Barnard, thou art a cit, with all thy worth;<br/>But Bug and D----l, their Honours, and so forth.<br/><br/>Yet every child another song will sing,<br/>'Virtue, brave boys! 'tis virtue makes a king.'<br/>True, conscious honour is to feel no sin,<br/>He's arm'd without that's innocent within;<br/>Be this thy screen, and this thy wall of brass;<br/>Compared to this, a minister's an ass.<br/><br/>And say, to which shall our applause belong,<br/>This new court-jargon, or the good old song?<br/>The modern language of corrupted peers,<br/>Or what was spoke at Cressy and Poictiers?<br/>Who counsels best? who whispers, 'Be but great,<br/>With praise or infamy leave that to fate;<br/>Get place and wealth, if possible, with grace;<br/>If not, by any means get wealth and place.'<br/>For what? to have a box where eunuchs sing,<br/>And foremost in the circle eye a king.<br/>Or he, who bids thee face with steady view<br/>Proud fortune, and look shallow greatness through:<br/>And, while he bids thee, sets th' example too?<br/>If such a doctrine, in St James's air,<br/>Should chance to make the well-dress'd rabble stare;<br/>If honest S----z take scandal at a spark,<br/>That less admires the palace than the park:<br/>Faith, I shall give the answer Reynard gave:<br/>'I cannot like, dread sir, your royal cave:<br/>Because I see, by all the tracks about,<br/>Full many a beast goes in, but none comes out.'<br/>Adieu to virtue, if you're once a slave:<br/>Send her to court, you send her to her grave.<br/><br/>Well, if a king's a lion, at the least<br/>The people are a many-headed beast:<br/>Can they direct what measures to pursue,<br/>Who know themselves so little what to do?<br/>Alike in nothing but one lust of gold,<br/>Just half the land would buy, and half be sold:<br/>Their country's wealth our mightier misers drain,<br/>Or cross, to plunder provinces, the main;<br/>The rest, some farm the poor-box, some the pews;<br/>Some keep assemblies, and would keep the stews;<br/>Some with fat bucks on childless dotards fawn;<br/>Some win rich widows by their chine and brawn;<br/>While with the silent growth of ten per cent,<br/>In dirt and darkness, hundreds stink content.<br/><br/>Of all these ways, if each pursues his own,<br/>Satire, be kind, and let the wretch alone:<br/>But show me one who has it in his power<br/>To act consistent with himself an hour.<br/>Sir Job sail'd forth, the evening bright and still,<br/>'No place on earth' (he cried) 'like Greenwich hill!'<br/>Up starts a palace, lo, the obedient base<br/>Slopes at its foot, the woods its sides embrace,<br/>The silver Thames reflects its marble face.<br/>Now let some whimsy, or that devil within,<br/>Which guides all those who know not what they mean,<br/>But give the knight (or give his lady) spleen;<br/>'Away, away! take all your scaffolds down,<br/>For, snug's the word: my dear! we'll live in town.'<br/><br/>At amorous Flavio is the stocking thrown?<br/>That very night he longs to lie alone.<br/>The fool, whose wife elopes some thrice a quarter,<br/>For matrimonial solace dies a martyr.<br/>Did ever Proteus, Merlin, any witch,<br/>Transform themselves so strangely as the rich?<br/>Well, but the poor--the poor have the same itch;<br/>They change their weekly barber, weekly news,<br/>Prefer a new japanner to their shoes,<br/>Discharge their garrets, move their beds, and run<br/>(They know not whither) in a chaise and one;<br/>They hire their sculler, and when once aboard,<br/>Grow sick, and damn the climate--like a lord.<br/><br/>You laugh, half-beau, half-sloven if I stand;<br/>My wig all powder, and all snuff my band;<br/>You laugh, if coat and breeches strangely vary,<br/>White gloves, and linen worthy Lady Mary!<br/>But, when no prelate's lawn with hair-shirt lined<br/>Is half so incoherent as my mind,<br/>When (each opinion with the next at strife,<br/>One ebb and flow of follies all my life)<br/>I plant, root up; I build, and then confound;<br/>Turn round to square, and square again to round;<br/>You never change one muscle of your face,<br/>You think this madness but a common case,<br/>Nor once to Chancery, nor to Hale apply;<br/>Yet hang your lip, to see a seam awry!<br/>Careless how ill I with myself agree,<br/>Kind to my dress, my figure, not to me.<br/>Is this my guide, philosopher, and friend?<br/>This, he who loves me, and who ought to mend?<br/>Who ought to make me (what he can, or none),<br/>That man divine whom Wisdom calls her own;<br/>Great without title, without fortune bless'd;<br/>Rich even when plunder'd, honour'd while oppress'd;<br/>Loved without youth, and follow'd without power;<br/>At home, though exiled; free, though in the Tower;<br/>In short, that reasoning, high, immortal thing,<br/>Just less than Jove, and much above a king,<br/>Nay, half in heaven--except (what's mighty odd)<br/>A fit of vapours clouds this demi-god.<br/><br/>       *       *       *       *       *<br/><br/>THE SIXTH EPISTLE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE.<br/><br/>TO MR MURRAY.<br/><br/>'Not to admire, is all the art I know,<br/>To make men happy, and to keep them so.'<br/>(Plain truth, dear Murray, needs no flowers of speech,<br/>So take it in the very words of Creech.)<br/><br/>This vault of air, this congregated ball,<br/>Self-centred sun, and stars that rise and fall,<br/>There are, my friend!

The author thought them<br/>considerable enough to address them to his prince; whom he paints with<br/>all the great and good qualities of a monarch, upon whom the Romans<br/>depended for the increase of an absolute empire. But to make the poem<br/>entirely English, I was willing to add one or two of those which<br/>contribute to the happiness of a free people, and are more consistent<br/>with the welfare of our neighbours.<br/><br/>This epistle will show the learned world to have fallen into two<br/>mistakes: One, that Augustus was a patron of poets in general; whereas<br/>he not only prohibited all but the best writers to name him, but<br/>recommended that care even to the civil magistrate: _Admonebat<br/>praetores, ne paterentur nomen suum obsolefieri_, &c. The other, that<br/>this piece was only a general discourse of poetry; whereas it was an<br/>apology for the poets, in order to render Augustus more their patron.<br/>Horace here pleads the cause of his contemporaries, first against the<br/>taste of the town, whose humour it was to magnify the authors of the<br/>preceding age; secondly against the court and nobility, who encouraged<br/>only the writers for the theatre; and lastly against the emperor<br/>himself, who had conceived them of little use to the government. He<br/>shows (by a view of the progress of learning, and the change of taste<br/>among the Romans) that the introduction of the polite arts of Greece had<br/>given the writers of his time great advantages over their predecessors;<br/>that their morals were much improved, and the license of those ancient<br/>poets restrained; that satire and comedy were become more just and<br/>useful; that whatever extravagances were left on the stage, were owing<br/>to the ill taste of the nobility; that poets, under due regulations,<br/>were in many respects useful to the state; and concludes, that it was<br/>upon them the emperor himself must depend for his fame with posterity.<br/><br/>We may further learn from this epistle, that Horace made his court to<br/>this great prince by writing with a decent freedom toward him, with a<br/>just contempt of his low flatterers, and with a manly regard to his own<br/>character.<br/><br/>TO AUGUSTUS.<br/><br/>While you, great patron of mankind! sustain<br/>The balanced world, and open all the main;<br/>Your country, chief, in arms abroad defend,<br/>At home, with morals, arts, and laws amend;<br/>How shall the Muse, from such a monarch,

rise.<br/><br/>Just in one instance, be it yet confess'd,<br/>Your people, sir, are partial in the rest:<br/>Foes to all living worth except your own,<br/>And advocates for folly dead and

sound,<br/>Or damn to all eternity at once,<br/>At ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce?<br/><br/>'We shall not quarrel for a year or two;<br/>By courtesy of England, he may do.'<br/><br/>Then, by the rule that made the horse-tail bare,<br/>I pluck out year by year, as hair by hair,<br/>And melt down ancients like a heap of snow:<br/>While you, to measure merits, look in Stowe,<br/>And estimating authors by the year,<br/>Bestow a garland only on a bier.<br/><br/>Shakspeare (whom you and every play-house bill<br/>Style the divine, the matchless, what you will),<br/>For gain, not glory, wing'd

I have none.'<br/>I wish you joy, sir, of a tyrant gone;<br/>But does no other lord it at this hour,<br/>As wild and mad--the avarice of power?<br/>Does neither rage inflame, nor fear appal?<br/>Not the black fear of death, that saddens all?<br/>With terrors round, can reason hold her throne,<br/>Despise the known, nor tremble at the unknown?<br/>Survey both worlds, intrepid and entire,<br/>In spite of witches, devils, dreams, and fire?<br/>Pleased to look forward, pleased to look behind,<br/>And count each birthday with a grateful mind?<br/>Has life no sourness, drawn so near its end?<br/>Canst thou endure a foe, forgive a friend?<br/>Has age but melted the rough parts away,<br/>As winter-fruits grow mild ere they decay?<br/>Or will you think, my friend, your business done,<br/>When, of a hundred thorns, you pull out one?<br/><br/>Learn to live well, or fairly make your will;<br/>You've play'd, and loved, and eat, and drank your fill:<br/>Walk sober off, before a sprightlier age<br/>Comes tittering on, and shoves you from the stage:<br/>Leave such to trifle with more grace and ease,<br/>Whom folly pleases, and whose follies please.<br/><br/>       *       *       *       *       *<br/><br/>BOOK I. EPISTLE VII.<br/><br/>IMITATED IN THE MANNER OF DR SWIFT.<br/><br/>'Tis true, my lord, I gave my word,<br/>I would be with you, June the third;<br/>Changed it to August, and (in short)<br/>Have kept it--as you do at court.<br/>You humour me when I am sick,<br/>Why not when I am splenetic?<br/>In town, what objects could I meet?<br/>The shops shut up in every street,<br/>And funerals blackening all the doors,<br/>And yet more melancholy whores:<br/>And what a dust in every place!<br/>And a thin court that wants your face,<br/>And fevers raging up and down,<br/>And W---- and H---- both in town!<br/><br/>'The dog-days are no more the case.'<br/>'Tis true, but winter comes apace:<br/>Then southward let your bard retire,<br/>Hold out some months 'twixt sun and fire,<br/>And you shall see, the first warm weather,<br/>Me and the butterflies together.<br/><br/>My lord, your favours well I know;<br/>'Tis with distinction you bestow;<br/>And not to every one that comes,<br/>Just as a Scotchman does his plums.<br/>'Pray, take them, sir,--enough's a feast:<br/>Eat some, and pocket up the rest.'<br/>What! rob your boys? those pretty rogues<br/>'No, sir, you'll leave them to the hogs.'<br/>Thus fools with compliments besiege ye,<br/>Contriving never to oblige ye.<br/>Scatter your favours on a fop,<br/>Ingratitude's the certain crop;<br/>And 'tis but just, I'll tell ye wherefore,<br/>You give the things you never care for.<br/>A wise man always is, or should,<br/>Be mighty ready to do good;<br/>But makes a difference in his thought<br/>Betwixt a guinea and a groat.<br/><br/>Now this I'll say, you'll find in me<br/>A safe companion, and a free;<br/>But if you'd have me always near--<br/>A word, pray, in your honour's ear.<br/>I hope it is your resolution<br/>To give me back my constitution!<br/>The sprightly wit, the lively eye,<br/>Th' engaging smile, the gaiety,<br/>That laugh'd down many a summer sun,<br/>And kept you up so oft till one:<br/>And all that voluntary vein,<br/>As when Belinda raised my strain.<br/><br/>A weasel once made shift to slink<br/>In at a corn-loft through a chink;<br/>But having amply stuff'd his skin,<br/>Could not get out as he got in:<br/>Which one belonging to the house<br/>('Twas not a man, it was a mouse)<br/>Observing, cried, 'You 'scape not so;<br/>Lean as you came, sir, you must go.'<br/><br/>Sir, you may spare your application,<br/>I'm no such beast, nor his relation;<br/>Nor one that temperance advance,<br/>Cramm'd to the throat with ortolans:<br/>Extremely ready to resign<br/>All that may make me none of mine.<br/>South-Sea subscriptions take who please,<br/>Leave me but liberty and ease.<br/>'Twas what I said to Craggs and Child,<br/>Who praised my modesty, and smiled.<br/>Give me, I cried, (enough for me)<br/>My bread, and independency!<br/>So bought an annual rent or two,<br/>And lived--just as you see I do;<br/>Near fifty, and without a wife,<br/>I trust that sinking fund, my life.<br/>Can I retrench? Yes, mighty well,<br/>Shrink back to my paternal cell,<br/>A little house, with trees a-row,<br/>And, like its master, very low.<br/>There died my father, no man's debtor,<br/>And there I'll die, nor worse, nor better.<br/><br/>To set this matter full before ye,<br/>Our old friend Swift will tell his story.<br/><br/>'Harley, the nation's great support'--<br/>But you may read it,--I stop short.
