# üíÆ The Character Of Holland by *Andrew Marvell*

<p>
    Holland, that scarce deserves the name of Land,<br/>As but th'Off-scouring of the Brittish Sand;<br/>And so much Earth as was contributed<br/>By English Pilots when they heav'd the Lead;<br/>Or what by th' Oceans slow alluvion fell,<br/>Of shipwrackt Cockle and the Muscle-shell;<br/>This indigested vomit of the Sea<br/>Fell to the Dutch by just Propriety.<br/>Glad then, as Miners that have found the Oar,<br/>They with mad labour fish'd the Land to Shoar;<br/>And div'd as desperately for each piece<br/>Of Earth, as if't had been of Ambergreece;<br/>Collecting anxiously small Loads of Clay,<br/>Less then what building Swallows bear away;<br/>Transfursing into them their Dunghil Soul.<br/>How did they rivet, with Gigantick Piles,<br/>Thorough the Center their new-catched Miles;<br/>And to the stake a strugling Country bound,<br/>Where barking Waves still bait the forced Ground;<br/>Building their watry Babel far more high<br/>To reach the Sea, then those to scale the Sky.<br/>Yet still his claim the Injur'd Ocean laid,<br/>And oft at Leap-frog ore their Steeples plaid:<br/>As if on purpose it on Land had come<br/>To shew them what's their Mare Liberum.<br/>A daily deluge over them does boyl;<br/>The Earth and Water play at Level-coyl;<br/>The Fish oft-times the Burger dispossest,<br/>And sat not as a Meat but as a Guest;<br/>And oft the Tritons and the Sea-Nymphs saw<br/>Whole sholes of Dutch serv'd up for Cabillan;<br/>Or as they over the new Level rang'd<br/>For pickled Herring, pickled Heeren chang'd.<br/>Nature, it seem'd, asham'd of her mistake,<br/>Would throw their land away at Duck and Drake.<br/>Therefore Necessity, that first made Kings,<br/>Something like Government among them brings.<br/>For as with Pygmees who best kills the Crane,<br/>Among the hungry he that treasures Grain,<br/>Among the blind the one-ey'd blinkard reigns,<br/>So rules among the drowned he that draines.<br/>Not who first see the rising Sun commands,<br/>But who could first discern the rising Lands.<br/>Who best could know to pump an Earth so leak<br/>Him they their Lord and Country's Father speak.<br/>To make a Bank was a great Plot of State;<br/>Invent a Shov'l and be a Magistrate.<br/>Hence some small Dyke-grave unperceiv'd invades<br/>The Pow'r, and grows as 'twere a King of Spades.<br/>But for less envy some Joynt States endures,<br/>Who look like a Commission of the Sewers.<br/>For these Half-anders, half wet, and half dry,<br/>Nor bear strict service, nor pure Liberty.<br/>'Tis probable Religion after this<br/>Came next in order; which they could not miss.<br/>How could the Dutch but be converted, when<br/>Th' Apostles were so many Fishermen?<br/>Besides the Waters of themselves did rise,<br/>And, as their Land, so them did re-baptise.<br/>Though Herring for their God few voices mist,<br/>And Poor-John to have been th' Evangelist.<br/>Faith, that could never Twins conceive before,<br/>Never so fertile, spawn'd upon this shore:<br/>More pregnant then their Marg'ret, that laid down<br/>For Hans-in-Kelder of a whole Hans-Town.<br/>Sure when Religion did it self imbark,<br/>And from the east would Westward steer its Ark,<br/>It struck, and splitting on this unknown ground,<br/>Each one thence pillag'd the first piece he found:<br/>Hence Amsterdam, Turk-Christian-Pagan-Jew,<br/>Staple of Sects and Mint of Schisme grew;<br/>That Bank of Conscience, where not one so strange<br/>Opinion but finds Credit, and Exchange.<br/>In vain for Catholicks our selves we bear;<br/>The Universal Church is onely there.<br/>Nor can Civility there want for Tillage,<br/>Where wisely for their Court they chose a Village.<br/>How fit a Title clothes their Governours,<br/>Themselves the Hogs as all their Subjects Bores<br/>Let it suffice to give their Country Fame<br/>That it had one Civilis call'd by Name,<br/>Some Fifteen hundred and more years ago,<br/>But surely never any that was so.<br/>See but their Mairmaids with their Tails of Fish,<br/>Reeking at Church over the Chafing-Dish.<br/>A vestal Turf enshrin'd in Earthen Ware<br/>Fumes through the loop-holes of wooden Square.<br/>Each to the Temple with these Altars tend,<br/>But still does place it at her Western End:<br/>While the fat steam of Female Sacrifice<br/>Fills the Priests Nostrils and puts out his Eyes.<br/>Or what a Spectacle the Skipper gross,<br/>A Water-Hercules Butter-Coloss,<br/>Tunn'd up with all their sev'ral Towns of Beer;<br/>When Stagg'ring upon some Land, Snick and Sneer,<br/>They try, like Statuaries, if they can,<br/>Cut out each others Athos to a Man:<br/>And carve in their large Bodies, where they please,<br/>The Armes of the United Provinces.<br/>But when such Amity at home is show'd;<br/>What then are their confederacies abroad?<br/>Let this one court'sie witness all the rest;<br/>When their hole Navy they together prest,<br/>Not Christian Captives to redeem from Bands:<br/>Or intercept the Western golden Sands:<br/>No, but all ancient Rights and Leagues must vail,<br/>Rather then to the English strike their sail;<br/>to whom their weather-beaten Province ows<br/>It self, when as some greater Vessal tows<br/>A Cock-boat tost with the same wind and fate;<br/>We buoy'd so often up their Sinking State.<br/>Was this Jus Belli & Pacis; could this be<br/>Cause why their Burgomaster of the Sea<br/>Ram'd with Gun-powder, flaming with Brand wine,<br/>Should raging hold his Linstock to the Mine?<br/>While, with feign'd Treaties, they invade by stealth<br/>Our sore new circumcised Common wealth.<br/>Yet of his vain Attempt no more he sees<br/>Then of Case-Butter shot and Bullet-Cheese.<br/>And the torn Navy stagger'd with him home,<br/>While the Sea laught it self into a foam,<br/>'Tis true since that (as fortune kindly sports,)<br/>A wholesome Danger drove us to our ports.<br/>While half their banish'd keels the Tempest tost,<br/>Half bound at home in Prison to the frost:<br/>That ours mean time at leisure might careen,<br/>In a calm Winter, under Skies Serene.<br/>As the obsequious Air and waters rest,<br/>Till the dear Halcyon hatch out all its nest.<br/>The Common wealth doth by its losses grow;<br/>And, like its own Seas, only Ebbs to flow.<br/>Besides that very Agitation laves,<br/>And purges out the corruptible waves.<br/>And now again our armed Bucentore<br/>Doth yearly their Sea-Nuptials restore.<br/>And how the Hydra of seaven Provinces<br/>Is strangled by our Infant Hercules.<br/>Their Tortoise wants its vainly stretched neck;<br/>Their Navy all our Conquest or our Wreck:<br/>Or, what is left, their Carthage overcome<br/>Would render fain unto our better Rome.<br/>Unless our Senate, lest their Youth disuse,<br/>The War, (but who would) Peace if begg'd refuse.<br/>For now of nothing may our State despair,<br/>Darling of Heaven, and of Men the Care;<br/>Provided that they be what they have been,<br/>Watchful abroad, and honest still within.<br/>For while our Neptune doth a Trident shake, Blake,<br/>Steel'd with those piercing Heads, Dean, Monck and<br/>And while Jove governs in the highest Sphere,<br/>Vainly in Hell let Pluto domineer.
