<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ An Occasional Prologue, by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Since the refinement of this polish'd age<br/>Has swept immoral raillery from the stage;<br/>Since taste has now expung'd licentious wit,<br/>Which stamp'd disgrace on all an author writ;<br/>Since, now, to please with purer scenes we seek,<br/>Nor dare to call the blush from Beauty's cheek;<br/>Oh! let the modest Muse some pity claim,<br/>And meet indulgence--though she find not fame.<br/>Still, not for _her_ alone, we wish respect,<br/>_Others_ appear more conscious of defect:<br/>To-night no _vet'ran Roscii_ you behold,<br/>In all the arts of scenic action old;<br/>No COOKE, no KEMBLE, can salute you here,<br/>No SIDDONS draw the sympathetic tear;<br/>To-night you throng to witness the _d√©but_<br/>Of embryo Actors, to the Drama new:<br/>Here, then, our almost unfledg'd wings we try;<br/>Clip not our _pinions_, ere the _birds can fly_:<br/>Failing in this our first attempt to soar,<br/>Drooping, alas! we fall to rise no more.<br/>Not one poor trembler, only, fear betrays,<br/>Who hopes, yet almost dreads to meet your praise;<br/>But all our Dramatis Person√¶ wait,<br/>In fond suspense this crisis of their fate.<br/>No venal views our progress can retard,<br/>Your generous plaudits are our sole reward;<br/>For these, each _Hero_ all his power displays,<br/>Each timid _Heroine_ shrinks before your gaze:<br/>Surely the last will some protection find?<br/>None, to the softer sex, can prove unkind:<br/>While Youth and Beauty form the female shield,<br/>The sternest Censor to the fair must yield.<br/>Yet, should our feeble efforts nought avail,<br/>Should, _after all_, our best endeavours fail;<br/>Still, let some mercy in your bosoms live,<br/>And, if you can't applaud, at least _forgive_.
</p>
