<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ To the Duke of Dorset by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Dorset! whose early steps with mine have stray'd,<br/>Exploring every path of Ida's glade;<br/>Whom, still, affection taught me to defend,<br/>And made me less a tyrant than a friend,<br/>Though the harsh custom of our youthful band<br/>Bade _thee_ obey, and gave _me_ to command;<br/>Thee, on whose head a few short years will shower<br/>The gift of riches, and the pride of power;<br/>E'en now a name illustrious is thine own,<br/>Renown'd in rank, not far beneath the throne.<br/>Yet, Dorset, let not this seduce thy soul<br/>To shun fair science, or evade controul;<br/>Though passive tutors, fearful to dispraise<br/>The titled child, whose future breath may raise,<br/>View ducal errors with indulgent eyes,<br/>And wink at faults they tremble to chastise.<br/>When youthful parasites, who bend the knee<br/>To wealth, their golden idol, not to thee,--<br/>And even in simple boyhood's opening dawn<br/>Some slaves are found to flatter and to fawn,--<br/>When these declare, "that pomp alone should wait<br/>On one by birth predestin'd to be great;<br/>That books were only meant for drudging fools,<br/>That gallant spirits scorn the common rules;"<br/>Believe them not,--they point the path to shame,<br/>And seek to blast the honours of thy name:<br/>Turn to the few in Ida's early throng,<br/>Whose souls disdain not to condemn the wrong;<br/>Or if, amidst the comrades of thy youth,<br/>None dare to raise the sterner voice of truth,<br/>Ask thine own heart--'twill bid thee, boy, forbear!<br/>For _well_ I know that virtue lingers there.<br/><br/>Yes! I have mark'd thee many a passing day,<br/>But now new scenes invite me far away;<br/>Yes! I have mark'd within that generous mind<br/>A soul, if well matur'd, to bless mankind;<br/>Ah! though myself, by nature haughty, wild,<br/>Whom Indiscretion hail'd her favourite child;<br/>Though every error stamps me for her own,<br/>And dooms my fall, I fain would fall alone;<br/>Though my proud heart no precept, now, can tame,<br/>I love the virtues which I cannot claim.<br/><br/>'Tis not enough, with other sons of power,<br/>To gleam the lambent meteor of an hour;<br/>To swell some peerage page in feeble pride,<br/>With long-drawn names that grace no page beside;<br/>Then share with titled crowds the common lot--<br/>In life just gaz'd at, in the grave forgot;<br/>While nought divides thee from the vulgar dead,<br/>Except the dull cold stone that hides thy head,<br/>The mouldering 'scutcheon, or the Herald's roll,<br/>That well-emblazon'd but neglected scroll,<br/>Where Lords, unhonour'd, in the tomb may find<br/>One spot, to leave a worthless name behind.<br/>There sleep, unnotic'd as the gloomy vaults<br/>That veil their dust, their follies, and their faults,<br/>A race, with old armorial lists o'erspread,<br/>In records destin'd never to be read.<br/>Fain would I view thee, with prophetic eyes,<br/>Exalted more among the good and wise;<br/>A glorious and a long career pursue,<br/>As first in Rank, the first in Talent too:<br/>Spurn every vice, each little meanness shun;<br/>Not Fortune's minion, but her noblest son.<br/>  Turn to the annals of a former day;<br/>Bright are the deeds thine earlier Sires display;<br/>One, though a courtier, lived a man of worth,<br/>And call'd, proud boast! the British drama forth.<br/>Another view! not less renown'd for Wit;<br/>Alike for courts, and camps, or senates fit;<br/>Bold in the field, and favour'd by the Nine;<br/>In every splendid part ordain'd to shine;<br/>Far, far distinguished from the glittering throng,<br/>The pride of Princes, and the boast of Song.<br/>Such were thy Fathers; thus preserve their name,<br/>Not heir to titles only, but to Fame.<br/>The hour draws nigh, a few brief days will close,<br/>To me, this little scene of joys and woes;<br/>Each knell of Time now warns me to resign<br/>Shades where Hope, Peace, and Friendship all were mine:<br/>Hope, that could vary like the rainbow's hue,<br/>And gild their pinions, as the moments flew;<br/>Peace, that reflection never frown'd away,<br/>By dreams of ill to cloud some future day;<br/>Friendship, whose truth let Childhood only tell;<br/>Alas! they love not long, who love so well.<br/><br/>To these adieu! nor let me linger o'er<br/>Scenes hail'd, as exiles hail their native shore,<br/>Receding slowly, through the dark-blue deep,<br/>Beheld by eyes that mourn, yet cannot weep.<br/><br/>  Dorset, farewell! I will not ask one part<br/>Of sad remembrance in so young a heart;<br/>The coming morrow from thy youthful mind<br/>Will sweep my name, nor leave a trace behind.<br/>And, yet, perhaps, in some maturer year,<br/>Since chance has thrown us in the self-same sphere,<br/>Since the same senate, nay, the same debate,<br/>May one day claim our suffrage for the state,<br/>We hence may meet, and pass each other by<br/>With faint regard, or cold and distant eye.<br/>For me, in future, neither friend nor foe,<br/>A stranger to thyself, thy weal or woe--<br/>With thee no more again I hope to trace<br/>The recollection of our early race;<br/>No more, as once, in social hours rejoice,<br/>Or hear, unless in crowds, thy well-known voice;<br/>Still, if the wishes of a heart untaught<br/>To veil those feelings, which, perchance, it ought,<br/>If these,--but let me cease the lengthen'd strain,--<br/>Oh! if these wishes are not breath'd in vain,<br/>The Guardian Seraph who directs thy fate<br/>Will leave thee glorious, as he found thee great.
</p>
