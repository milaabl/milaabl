<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ A Version of Ossian's Address to the Sun.  From the Poem "Carthon." by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    O THOU! who rollest in yon azure field,<br/>Round as the orb of my forefather's shield,<br/>Whence are thy beams? From what eternal store<br/>Dost thou, O Sun! thy vast effulgence pour?<br/>In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high,<br/>The stars start back and hide them in the sky;<br/>The pale Moon sickens in thy brightening blaze,<br/>And in the western wave avoids thy gaze.<br/>Alone thou shinest forth--for who can rise<br/>Companion of thy splendour in the skies!<br/>The mountain oaks are seen to fall away--<br/>Mountains themselves by length of years decay--<br/>With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost;<br/>In heaven the Moon is for a season lost,<br/>But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy,<br/>The same art ever, blazing in the sky!<br/>When tempests wrap the world from pole to pole,<br/>When vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll,<br/>Thou far above their utmost fury borne,<br/>Look'st forth in beauty, laughing them to scorn.<br/>But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze--<br/>Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze!<br/>Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay,<br/>On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play,<br/>Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest,<br/>Thou tremblest at the portals of the west,<br/>I see no more! But thou mayest fail at length,<br/>Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength,<br/>Like him--but for a season--in thy sphere<br/>To shine with splendour, then to disappear!<br/>Thy years shall have an end, and thou no more<br/>Bright through the world enlivening radiance pour,<br/>But sleep within thy clouds, and fail to rise,<br/>Heedless when Morning calls thee to the skies!<br/>Then now exult, O Sun! and gaily shine,<br/>While Youth and Strength and Beauty all are thine.<br/>For Age is dark, unlovely, as the light<br/>Shed by the Moon when clouds deform the night,<br/>Glimmering uncertain as they hurry past.<br/>Loud o'er the plain is heard the northern blast,<br/>Mists shroud the hills, and 'neath the growing gloom,<br/>The weary traveller shrinks and sighs for home.
</p>
