# üíÆ Beautiful Aberfoyle by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    The mountains and glens of Aberfoyle are beautiful to sight,<br/>Likewise the rivers and lakes are sparkling and bright;<br/>And its woods were frequented by the Lady of the Lake,<br/>And on its Lakes many a sail in her boat she did take.<br/><br/>The scenery there will fill the tourist with joy,<br/>Because 'tis there once lived the bold Rob Roy,<br/>Who spent many happy days with his Helen there,<br/>By chasing the deer in the woods so fair.<br/><br/>The little vale of Aberfoyle and its beautiful river<br/>Is a sight, once seen, forget it you'll never;<br/>And romantic ranges of rock on either side<br/>Form a magnificent background far and wide.<br/><br/>And the numerous lochs there abound with trout<br/>Which can be had for the taking out,<br/>Especially from the Lochs Chon and Ard,<br/>There the angler can make a catch which will his toil reward.<br/><br/>And between the two lochs the Glasgow Water Works are near,<br/>Which convey water of Loch Katrine in copious streams clear<br/>To the inhabitants of the Great Metropolis of the West,<br/>And for such pure water they should think themselves blest.<br/><br/>The oak and birch woods there are beautiful to view,<br/>Also the Ochil hills which are blue in hue,<br/>Likewise the Lake of Menteith can be seen far eastward,<br/>Also Stirling Castle, which long ago the English beseiged very hard.<br/><br/>Then away to Aberfoyle, Rob Roy's country,<br/>And gaze on the magnificent scenery.<br/>A region of rivers and mountains towering majestically<br/>Which is lovely and fascinating to see.<br/><br/>But no words can describe the beautiful scenery.<br/>Aberfoyle must be visited in order to see,<br/>So that the mind may apprehend its beauties around,<br/>Which will charm the hearts of the visitors I'll be bound.<br/><br/>As for the clachan of aberfoyle, little remains but a hotel,<br/>Which for accomodation which will suit the traveller very well.<br/>And the bedding thereis clean and good,<br/>And good cooks there to cook the food.<br/><br/>Then away to the mountains and lakes of bonnie Aberfoyle,<br/>Ye hard-working sons and daughters of daily toil;<br/>And traverse its heathery mountains and viewits lakes so clear,<br/>When the face of Nature's green in the spring of the year.
