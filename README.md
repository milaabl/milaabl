# üíÆ A poem on divine revelation by *Hugh Henry Brackenridge*

<p>
    This is a day of happiness, sweet peace,<br/>And heavenly sunshine; upon which conven'd<br/>In full assembly fair, once more we view,<br/>And hail with voice expressive of the heart,<br/>Patrons and sons of this illustrious hall.<br/>This hall more worthy of its rising fame<br/>Than hall on mountain or romantic hill,<br/>Where Druid bards sang to the hero's praise,<br/>While round their woods and barren heaths was heard<br/>The shrill calm echo of th' enchanting shell.<br/>Than all those halls and lordly palaces<br/>Where in the days of chivalry, each knight,<br/>And baron brave in military pride<br/>Shone in the brass and burning steel of war;<br/>For in this hall more worthy of a strain<br/>No envious sound forbidding peace is heard,<br/>Fierce song of battle kindling martial rage<br/>And desp'rate purpose in heroic minds:<br/>But sacred truth fair science and each grace<br/>Of virtue born; health, elegance and ease<br/>And temp'rate mirth in social intercourse<br/>Convey rich pleasure to the mind; and oft<br/>The sacred muse in heaven-breathing song<br/>Doth wrap the soul in extasy divine,<br/>Inspiring joy and sentiment which not<br/>The tale of war or song of Druids gave.<br/>The song of Druids or the tale of war<br/>With martial vigour every breast inspir'd,<br/>With valour fierce and love of deathless fame;<br/>But here a rich and splendid throng conven'd<br/>From many a distant city and fair town,<br/>Or rural seat by shore or mountain-stream,<br/>Breathe joy and blessing to the human race,<br/>Give countenance to arts themselves have known,<br/>Inspire the love of heights themselves have reach'd,<br/>Of noble science to enlarge the mind,<br/>Of truth and virtue to adorn the soul,<br/>And make the human nature grow divine.<br/><br/><br/>Oh could the muse on this auspicious day<br/>Begin a song of more majestic sound,<br/>Or touch the lyre on some sublimer key,<br/>Meet entertainment for the noble mind.<br/>How shall the muse from this poetic bow'r<br/>So long remov'd, and from this happy hill,<br/>Where ev'ry grace and ev'ry virtue dwells,<br/>And where the springs of knowledge and of thought<br/>In riv'lets clear and gushing streams flow down<br/>Attempt a strain? How sing in rapture high<br/>Or touch in vari'd melody the lyre<br/>The lyre so long neglected and each strain<br/>Unmeditated, and long since forgot?<br/>But yet constrain'd on this occasion sweet<br/>To this fam'd hall and this assembly fair<br/>With comely presence honouring the day,<br/>She fain would pay a tributary strain.<br/>A purer strain though not of equal praise<br/>To that which Fingal heard when Ossian sung<br/>With voice high rais'd in Selma hall of shells;<br/>Or that which Pindar on th' Elean plain,<br/>Sang with immortal skill and voice divine,<br/>When native Thebes and ev'ry Grecian state<br/>Pour'd forth her sons in rapid chariot race,<br/>To shun the goal and reach the glorious palm.<br/>He sang the pride of some ambitious chief,<br/>For olive crowns and wreaths of glory won;<br/>I sing the rise of that all glorious light,<br/>Whose sacred dawn the aged fathers saw<br/>By faith's clear eye, through many a cloud obscure<br/>And heavy mist between: they saw it beam<br/>From Judah's royal tribe, they saw it shine<br/>O'er Judah's happy land, and bade the hills,<br/>The rocky hills and barren vallies smile,<br/>The desert blossom and the wilds rejoice.<br/><br/><br/>This is that light and revelation pure,<br/>Which Jacob saw and in prophetic view,<br/>Did hail its author from the skies, and bade<br/>The sceptre wait with sov'reignty and sway<br/>On Judah's hand till Shiloh came. That light<br/>Which Beor's son in clearer vision saw,<br/>Its beams sore piercing his malignant eye;<br/>But yet constrain'd by the eternal truth<br/>Confess'd its origin and hail'd its rise,<br/>Fresh as a star from Judah's sacred line.<br/>This, Amos' son touch'd with seraphic fire<br/>In after times beheld. He saw it beam<br/>From Judah's royal tribe; he saw it shine<br/>O'er Judah's happy land, and bade the hills,<br/>The rocky hills and barren vallies smile,<br/>The desert blossom and the wilds rejoice.<br/><br/><br/>This is that light which purifies the soul,<br/>From mist obscure, of envy, hate, and pride;<br/>Bids love celestial in the bosom glow,<br/>Fresh kindling up the intellectual eye<br/>Of faith divine, in beatific view<br/>Of that high glory and seraphic bliss,<br/>Which he who reigns invisible, shall give<br/>To wait on virtue in the realms of day.<br/><br/><br/>This is that light which from remotest times<br/>Shone to the just; gave sweet serenity,<br/>And sunshine to the soul, of each wise sage,<br/>Fam'd patriarch, and holy man of God,<br/>Who in the infancy of time did walk<br/>With step unerring, through those dreary shades,<br/>Which veil'd the world e'er yet the golden sun<br/>Of revelation beam'd. Seth, Enos, and<br/>The family of him preserv'd from death<br/>By flood of waters. Abram and that swain<br/>Who erst exil'd in Midian did sing<br/>The world from chaos rising, and the birth<br/>Of various nature in the earth, or sea,<br/>Or element of air, or heav'n above.<br/><br/><br/>This is that light which on fair Zion hill<br/>Descending gradual, in full radiance beam'd<br/>O'er Canaan's happy land. Her fav'rite seers<br/>Had intercourse divine with this pure source,<br/>And oft from them a stream of light did flow,<br/>To each adjoining vale and desert plain,<br/>Lost in the umbrage of dark heathen shades.<br/>'Twas at this stream the fabling poets drank<br/>And sang how heav'n and earth from chaos rose;<br/>'Twas at this stream the wiser sages drank<br/>And straightway knew the soul immortal lives<br/>Beyond the grave and all the wrecks of time.<br/><br/><br/>From Judah's sacred hills a partial ray<br/>Extraneous, visited and cheer'd the gloom<br/>Spread o'er the shaded earth; yet more than half<br/>In superstition and the dreams of night<br/>Each hoary sage by long experience wise,<br/>And high philosopher of learning fam'd<br/>Lay buried deep shut from the light of day.<br/>Shut from the light of revelation clear<br/>In devious path they wandered oft,<br/>Nor could strong reason with the partial beam<br/>Of revelation, wholly dissipate<br/>The midnight horrors of so dark an age.<br/>Vain were their searches, and their reason vain,<br/>Else whence the visionary tales receiv'd,<br/>Of num'rous deities in earth, or heav'n<br/>Or sea, or river, or the shades profound<br/>Of Erebus, dark kingdom of the dead.<br/>Weak deities of fabled origin<br/>From king or hero, to the skies advanc'd<br/>For sanguinary appetite, and skill<br/>In cruel feats of arms, and tyranny<br/>O'er ev'ry right, and privilege of man.<br/>Vain were their searches, and their reason vain,<br/>Else whence the sculptur'd image of a god,<br/>And marble bust ador'd as deity,<br/>Altar and hecatomb prepar'd for these,<br/>Or human sacrifice when hecatomb<br/>Consum'd in vain with ceremony dire,<br/>And rites abhorr'd, denied the wish'd success.<br/>Reason is dark, else why heroic deem'd<br/>Fell suicide, as if 'twere fortitude<br/>And higher merit to recede from life,<br/>Shunning the ills of poverty, or pain,<br/>Or wasting sickness, or the victor's sword,<br/>Than to support with patience fully tried<br/>As Job, thence equall'd with him in renown.<br/><br/><br/>Shut from the light of revelation clear<br/>The world lay hid in shades, and reason's lamp<br/>Serv'd but to show how dark it was; but now<br/>The joyous time with hasty steps advanc'd,<br/>When truth no more should with a partial ray<br/>Shine on the shaded earth; now on swift wings<br/>The rosy hours brought on in beauty mild,<br/>The day-spring from on high, and from the top<br/>Of some fair mount Chaldean shepherds view<br/>That orient star which Beor's son beheld,<br/>From Aram east, and mark'd its lucid ray,<br/>Shedding sweet influence on Judah's land.<br/>Now o'er the plain of Bethl'em to the swains<br/>Who kept their flocks beneath the dews of night,<br/>A light appears expressive of that day<br/>More general, which o'er the shaded earth<br/>Breaks forth, and in the radiance of whose beams,<br/>The humble shepherd, and the river-swain<br/>By Jordan stream, or Galilea's lake,<br/>Can see each truth and paradox explain'd,<br/>Which not each wise philosopher of Greece,<br/>Could tell, nor sage of India, nor the sons<br/>Of Zoroaster, in deep secrets skill'd.<br/><br/><br/>Such light on Canaan shone but not confin'd<br/>With partial ray to Judah's favour'd land,<br/>Each vale and region to the utmost bound<br/>Of habitable earth, distant or nigh<br/>Soon finds a gleam of this celestial day:<br/>Fam'd Persia's mountains and rough Bactria's woods<br/>And Media's vales and Shinar's distant plain:<br/>The Lybian desert near Cyrene smiles<br/>And Ethiopia hails it to her shores.<br/>Arabia drinks the lustre of its ray<br/>Than fountain sweeter, or the cooling brook<br/>Which laves her burning sands; than stream long sought<br/>Through desert flowing and the scorched plain<br/>To Sheba's troop or Tema's caravan.<br/><br/><br/>Egypt beholds the dawn of this fair morn<br/>And boasts her rites mysterious no more;<br/>Her hidden learning wrapt in symbols strange<br/>Of hieroglyphic character, engrav'd<br/>On marble pillar, or the mountain rock,<br/>Or pyramid enduring many an age.<br/>She now receives asserted and explain'd<br/>That holy law, which on mount Sinai writ<br/>By God's own finger, and to Moses giv'n,<br/>And to the chosen seed, a rule of life.<br/>And strict obedience due; but now once more<br/>Grav'd on the living tablet of the heart,<br/>And deep impress'd by energy divine,<br/>Is legible through an eternal age.<br/><br/><br/>North of Judea now this day appears<br/>On Syria west, and in each city fair<br/>Full many a church of noble fame doth rise.<br/>In Antioch the seat of Syrian kings,<br/>And old Damascus, where Hazael reign'd.<br/>Now Cappadocia Mithridates' realm,<br/>And poison-bearing Pontus, whose deep shades<br/>Were shades of death, admit the light of truth.<br/>In Asia less seven luminaries rise,<br/>Bright lights, which with celestial vigour burn,<br/>And give the day in fullest glory round.<br/>There Symrna shines, and Thyatira there,<br/>There Ephesus a sister light appears,<br/>And Pergamus with kindred glory burns:<br/>She burns enkindled with a purer flame<br/>Than Troy of old, when Grecian kings combin'd<br/>Had set her gates on fire: The Hellespont<br/>And all th' Egean sea shone to the blaze.<br/><br/><br/>But now more west the gracious day serene<br/>On Athens rising, throws a dark eclipse<br/>On that high learning by her sages taught,<br/>In each high school of philosophic fame;<br/>Vain wisdom, useless sophistry condemn'd,<br/>As ignorance and foolishness of men.<br/>Let her philosophers debate no more<br/>In the Lyceum, or the Stoics porch,<br/>Holding high converse, but in error lost<br/>Of pain, and happiness, and fate supreme.<br/>Fair truth from heav'n draws all their reas'ning high<br/>In captive chains bound at her chariot wheels.<br/><br/><br/>Now Rome imperial, mistress of the world<br/>Drinks the pure lustre of the orient ray<br/>Assuaging her fierce thirst of bloody war,<br/>Dominion boundless, victory and fame;<br/>Each bold centurion, and each pr√¶tor finds<br/>A nobler empire to subdue themselves.<br/><br/><br/>From Rome the mistress of the world in peace,<br/>Far to the north the golden light ascends;<br/>To Gaul and Britain and the utmost bound<br/>Of Thule famous in poetic song,<br/>Victorious there where not Rome's consuls brave,<br/>Heroes, or conquering armies, ever came.<br/>Far in the artic skies a light is seen,<br/>Unlike that sun, which shall ere long retreat,<br/>And leave their hills one half the year in shades.<br/>Or that Aurora which the sailor sees<br/>Beneath the pole in dancing beams of light,<br/>Playing its gambols on the northern hills.<br/>That light is vain and gives no genial heat,<br/>To warm the tenants of those frozen climes,<br/>Or give that heav'nly vigour to the soul,<br/>Which truth divine and revelation brings;<br/>And but for which each heart must still remain,<br/>Hard as the rock on Scandanavia's shore,<br/>Cold as the ice which bridges up her streams,<br/>Fierce as the storm which tempests all her waves.<br/><br/><br/>Thus in its dawn did sacred truth prevail,<br/>In either hemisphere from north to south,<br/>From east to west through the long tract of day.<br/>From Shinar's plain to Thule's utmost isle,<br/>From Persia's bay to Scandanavia's shores.<br/>Cheer'd by its ray now ev'ry valley smiles,<br/>And ev'ry lawn smote by its morning beam.<br/>Now ev'ry hill reflects a purer ray,<br/>Than when Aurora paints his woods in gold,<br/>Or when the sun first in the orient sky,<br/>Sets thick with gems the dewy mountain's brow.<br/><br/><br/>The earth perceives a sov'reign virtue shed<br/>And from each cave, and midnight haunt retires<br/>Dark superstition, with her vot'ries skill'd,<br/>In potent charm, or spell of magic pow'r;<br/>In augury, by voice, or flight of birds,<br/>Or boding sign at morn, or noon, or eve,<br/>Portent and prodigy and omen dire.<br/>Each oracle by Demon, or the craft<br/>Of priests, made vocal, can declare no more<br/>Of high renown, and victory secure,<br/>To kings low prostrate at their bloody shrines.<br/>No more with vain uncertainty perplex<br/>Mistaken worshippers, or give unseen<br/>Response ambiguous in some mystic sound,<br/>And hollow murmer from the dark recess.<br/>No more of Lybian Jove; Dodona's oaks,<br/>In sacred grove give prophecy no more.<br/>Th' infernal deities retire abash'd,<br/>Our God himself on earth begins his reign;<br/>Pure revelation beams on ev'ry land,<br/>On ev'ry heart exerts a sov'reign sway,<br/>And makes the human nature grow divine.<br/><br/><br/>Now hideous war forgets one half her rage,<br/>And smoothes her visage horible to view.<br/>Celestial graces better sooth the soul,<br/>Than vocal music, or the charming sound<br/>Of harp or lyre. More than the golden lyre<br/>Which Orpheus tun'd in melancholy notes,<br/>Which almost pierc'd the dull cold ear of death,<br/>And mov'd the grave to give him back his bride.<br/><br/><br/>Peace with the graces and fair science now<br/>Wait on the gospel car; science improv'd<br/>Puts on a fairer dress; a fairer form<br/>Now ev'ry art assumes; bold eloquence<br/>Moves in a higher sphere than senates grave,<br/>Or mix'd assembly, or the hall of kings,<br/>Which erst with pompous panegyric rung.<br/>Vain words and soothing flattery she hates,<br/>And feigned tears, and tongue which silver-tipt<br/>Moves in the cause of wickedness and pride.<br/>She mourns not that fair liberty depress'd<br/>Which kings tyrannic can extort, but that<br/>Pure freedom of the soul to truth divine<br/>Which first indulg'd her and with envious hand<br/>Pluck'd thence, left hideous slavery behind.<br/>She weeps not loss of property on earth,<br/>Nor stirs the multitude to dire revenge<br/>With headlong violence, but soothes the soul<br/>To harmony and peace, bids them aspire<br/>With emulation and pure zeal of heart,<br/>To that high glory in the world unseen,<br/>And crown celestial, which pure virtue gives.<br/><br/><br/>Thus eloquence and poesy divine<br/>A nobler range of sentiment receive;<br/>Life brought to view and immortality,<br/>A recent world through which bold fancy roves,<br/>And gives new magic to the pow'r of song;<br/>For where the streams of revelation flow<br/>Unknown to bards of Helicon, or those<br/>Who on the top of Pindus, or the banks<br/>Of Arethusa and Eurotas stray'd,<br/>The poet drinks, and glorying in new strength,<br/>Soars high in rapture of sublimer strains;<br/>Such as that prophet sang who tun'd his harp<br/>On Zion hill and with seraphic praise<br/>In psalm and sacred ode by Siloa's brook,<br/>Drew HIS attention who first touch'd the soul<br/>With taste of harmony, and bade the spheres<br/>Move in rich measure to the songs on high.<br/>Fill'd with this spirit poesy no more<br/>Adorns that vain mythology believ'd,<br/>By rude barbarian, and no more receives,<br/>The tale traditional, and hymn profane,<br/>Sung by high genius, basely prostitute.<br/>New strains are heard, such as first in the morn<br/>Of time, were sung by the angelic choirs,<br/>When rising from chaotic state the earth<br/>Orbicular was seen, and over head<br/>The blazing sun, moon, planet, and each light<br/>That gilds the firmament, rush'd into view.<br/><br/><br/>Thus did the sun of revelation shine<br/>Full on the earth, and grateful were its beams:<br/>Its beams were grateful to the chosen seed,<br/>To all whose works were worthy of the day.<br/>But creatures lucifuge, whose ways were dark,<br/>Ere this in shades of paganism hid,<br/>Did vent their poison, and malignant breath,<br/>To stain the splendour of the light divine,<br/>Which pierc'd their cells and brought their deeds to view<br/>Num'rous combin'd of ev'ry tongue and tribe,<br/>Made battle proud, and impious war brought on,<br/>Against the chosen sanctified by light.<br/>Riches and pow'r leagu'd in their train were seen,<br/>Sword, famine, flames and death before them prey'd.<br/>Those faithful found, who undismay'd did bear<br/>A noble evidence to truth, were slain.<br/>Why should I sing of these or here record,<br/>As if 'twere praise, in poesy or song,<br/>Or sculptur'd stone, to eternize the names,<br/>Which writ elsewhere in the fair book of life,<br/>Shall live unsullied when each strain shall die:<br/>Shall undefac'd remain when sculptur'd stone,<br/>And monument, and bust, and storied urn<br/>Perpetuates its sage and king no more.<br/><br/><br/>The pow'r of torture and reproach was vain,<br/>But what not torture or reproach could do,<br/>Dark superstition did in part effect.<br/>That superstition, which saint John beheld,<br/>Rise in thick darkness from th' infernal lake.<br/>Locust and scorpion in the smoke ascend,<br/>False teacher, heretic, and Antichrist.<br/>The noon day sun is dark'ned in the sky,<br/>The moon forbears to give her wonted light.<br/>Full many a century the darkness rul'd,<br/>With heavier gloom than once on Egypt came,<br/>Save that on some lone coast, or desert isle,<br/>Where sep'rate far a chosen spirit dwelt,<br/>A Goshen shone, with partial-streaming ray.<br/>Night on the one side settles dark; on Rome,<br/>It settles dark, and ev'ry land more west<br/>Is wrapt in shades. Night on the east comes down<br/>With gloom Tartarean, and in part it rose<br/>From Tartary beneath the dusky pole.<br/>The ruthless Turk, and Saracen in arms,<br/>O'er-run the land the gospel once illum'd;<br/>The holy land Judea once so nam'd,<br/>And Syria west where many churches rose.<br/>Those golden luminaries are remov'd,<br/>Which once in Asia shone. Athens no more<br/>For truth and learning fam'd. Corinth obscur'd,<br/>Ionia mourns through all her sea-girt isles.<br/><br/><br/>But yet once more the light of truth shall shine<br/>In this obscure sojourn; shall shoot its beam<br/>In morning beauty mild, o'er hill and dale.<br/>See in Bohemia and the lands more west<br/>The heavenly ray of revelation shines,<br/>Fresh kindling up true love and purest zeal.<br/><br/><br/>Britannia next beholds the risen day<br/>In reformation bright; cheerful she hails<br/>It from her snow-white cliffs, and bids her sons,<br/>Rise from the mist of popery obscure.<br/>Her worthier sons, whom not Rome's pontiff high,<br/>Nor king with arbitrary sway could move.<br/>Those mightier who with constancy untam'd,<br/>Did quench the violence of fire, at death<br/>Did smile, and maugre ev'ry pain, of bond,<br/>Cold dark imprisonment, and scourge severe,<br/>By hell-born popery devis'd, held fast<br/>The Christian hope firm anchor of the soul.<br/>Or those who shunning that fell rage of war,<br/>And persecution dire, when civil pow'r,<br/>Leagu'd in with sacerdotal sway triumph'd,<br/>O'er ev'ry conscience, and the lives of men,<br/>Did brave th' Atlantic deep and through its storms<br/>Sought these Americ shores: these happier shores<br/>Where birds of calm delight to play, where not<br/>Rome's pontiff high, nor arbitrary king,<br/>Leagu'd in with sacerdotal sway are known.<br/>But peace and freedom link'd together dwell,<br/>And reformation in full glory shines.<br/>Oh for a muse of more exalted wing,<br/>To celebrate those men who planted first<br/>The christian church in these remotest lands;<br/>From those high plains where spreads a colony,<br/>Gen'rous and free, from Massachusett-shores,<br/>To the cold lakes margin'd with snow: from that<br/>Long dreary tract of shady woods and hills,<br/>Where Hudson's icy stream rolls his cold wave,<br/>To those more sunny bowers where zephyrs breath,<br/>And round which flow in circling current swift<br/>The Delaware and Susquehannah streams.<br/>Thence to those smiling plains where Chesapeak<br/>Spreads her maternal arms, encompassing<br/>In soft embrace, full many a settlement,<br/>Where opulence, with hospitality,<br/>And polish'd manners, and the living plant<br/>Of science blooming, sets their glory high [1].<br/>Thence to Virginia, sister colony,<br/>Lib'ral in sentiment, and breathing high,<br/>The noble ardour of the freeborn soul.<br/>To Carolina thence, and that warm clime<br/>Where Georgia south in summer heat complains,<br/>And distant thence towards the burning line.<br/><br/><br/>These men deserve our song, and those who still,<br/>With industry severe, and steady aim<br/>Diffuse the light in this late dreary land,<br/>In whose lone wastes and solitudes forlorn,<br/>Death long sat brooding with his raven wing.<br/>Who many 'a structure of great fame have rais'd,<br/>College, and school, upon th' Atlantic coast,<br/>Or inland town, through ev'ry province wide,<br/>Which rising up like pyramids of fire,<br/>Give light and glory to the western world.<br/><br/><br/>These men we honour, and their names shall last<br/>Sweet in the mouths and memory of men;<br/>Or if vain man unconscious of their worth,<br/>Refuse a tear when in some lonely vale<br/>He sees those faithful laid; each breeze shall sigh,<br/>Each passing gale shall mourn, each tree shall bend<br/>Its heavy head, in sorrow o'er their tombs,<br/>And some sad stream run ever weeping by.<br/>Weep not O stream, nor mourn thou passing gale,<br/>Beneath those grassy tombs their bodies lie,<br/>But they have risen from each labour bere<br/>To make their entrance on a nobler stage.<br/>What though with us they walk the humble vale<br/>Of indigence severe, with want oppress'd?<br/>Riches belong not to their family,<br/>Nor sloth luxurious nor the pride of kings;<br/>But truth meek-ey'd and warm benevolence<br/>Wisdom's high breeding in her sons rever'd<br/>Bespeaks them each the children[2] of a king.<br/>The christian truth of origin divine,<br/>Grows not beneath the shade of civil pow'r,<br/>Riches or wealth accompanied with pride;<br/>Nor shall it bloom transplanted to that soil,<br/>Where persecution, in malignant streams,<br/>Flows out to water it; black streams and foul<br/>Which from the lake of Tartarus break forth,<br/>The sickly tide of Acheron which flows,<br/>With putrid waves through the infernal shades.<br/>This plant of heaven loves the gentle beams,<br/>Of truth and meekness, and the kindly dew<br/>Which fell on Zion hill; it loves the care<br/>Of humble shepherds, and the rural swain,<br/>And tended by their hands it flourishes<br/>With fruit and blossoms, and soon gives a shade,<br/>Beneath which ev'ry traveller shall rest,<br/>Safe from the burning east-wind and the sun.<br/>A vernal shade not with'ring like the gourd<br/>Of him who warned Nineveh, but like<br/>The aged oaks immortal on the plain<br/>Of Kadesh, or tall cedars on the hill<br/>Of Lebanon, and Hermon's shady top.<br/><br/><br/>High is their fame through each succeeding age<br/>Who build the walls of Zion upon earth.<br/>Let mighty kings and potentates combine,<br/>To raise a pyramid, which neither storm,<br/>Nor sea indignant, nor the raging fire,<br/>Nor time can waste, or from firm basis move.<br/>Or let them strive by counsel or by arms,<br/>To fix a throne, and in imperial sway,<br/>Build up a kingdom shadowing the earth,<br/>Unmov'd by thunder or impetuous storm<br/>Of civil war, dark treason, or the shock<br/>Of hostile nations, in dire league combin'd.<br/>They build a kingdom of a nobler date,<br/>Who build the kingdom of the Saviour God.<br/>This, not descending rain, nor mighty storm,<br/>Nor sea indignant, nor the raging fire,<br/>Nor time shall waste, or from firm basis move.<br/>Rounded on earth its head doth reach the skies,<br/>Secure from thunder, and impetuous storm,<br/>Of civil war, dark treason, or the shock<br/>Of hostile nations in dire league combin'd.<br/>This still shall flourish and survive the date,<br/>Of each wide state and empire of the earth<br/>Which yet shall rise, as now of those which once<br/>From richest Asia or from Europe spread<br/>On mighty base and shaded half the world.<br/>Great Babylon which vex'd the chosen seed,<br/>And by whose streams the captive Hebrews sat,<br/>In desolation lies, and Syria west,<br/>Where the Seleucid√¶ did fix their throne,<br/>Loud-thund'ring thence o'er Judah's spoiled land,<br/>Boasts her proud rule no more. Rome pagan next,<br/>The raging furnace where the saints were tried,<br/>No more enslaves mankind. Rome papal too<br/>Contracts her reign and speaks proud things no more.<br/>The throne of Ottoman is made to shake,<br/>The Russian thund'ring to his firmest seat;<br/>Another age shall see his empire fall.<br/>Yet in the east the light of truth shall shine,<br/>And like the sun returning after storms<br/>Which long had raged through a sunless sky,<br/>Shall beam beningly on forsaken lands.<br/>The day serene once more on Zion hill<br/>Descending gradual, shall in radiance beam<br/>On Canaan's happy land. Her fav'rite seers<br/>Have intercourse divine with this pure source;<br/>Perennial thence rich streams of light shall flow,<br/>To each adjoining vale and desert plain<br/>Lost in the umbrage of dark heathen shades.<br/>The gospel light shall gloriously survive<br/>The wasting blaze of ev'ry baser fire.<br/>The fire of Vesta, an eternal fire,<br/>So falsely call'd and kept alive at Rome;<br/>Sepulchral lamp in burial place of kings,<br/>Burn'd unconsum'd for many ages down;<br/>But yet not Vesta's fire eternal call'd<br/>And kept alive at Rome, nor burning lamp<br/>Hid in sepulchral monument of kings,<br/>Shall bear an equal date with that true light,<br/>Which shone from earth to heav'n, and which shall shine<br/>Up through eternity, and be the light<br/>Of heav'n, the new Jerusalem above.<br/>This light from heav'n shall yet illume the earth<br/>And give its beams to each benighted land<br/>Now with new glory lighted up again.<br/>Then ruthless Turk and Saracen shall know<br/>The fallacies of him Medina bred,<br/>And whose vain tomb, in Mecca they adore.<br/>Then Jews shall view the great Messiah come,<br/>And each rent tribe in caravan by land,<br/>Or ship by sea, shall visit Palestine<br/>Thrice holy then, with vile Idolatry<br/>No more defil'd, altar on mountain head,<br/>Green shady hill, or idol of the grove.<br/>For there a light appears, with which compar'd,<br/>That was a twilight shed by rite obscure,<br/>And ceremony dark and sacrifice<br/>Dimly significant of things to come.<br/>Blest with this light no more they deviate<br/>In out-way path; distinguished no more<br/>By school or sect, Essene or Saducee,<br/>Cairite or Scribe of Pharisaic mould.<br/>Jew and Samaritan debate no more,<br/>Whether on Gerizim or Zion hill<br/>They shall bow down. Above Moriah's mount<br/>Each eye is raised to him, whose temple is<br/>Th' infinitude of space, whom earth, sea, sky<br/>And heav'n itself cannot contain. No more<br/>The noise of battle shall be heard, or shout<br/>Of war by heathen princes wag'd; There's nought<br/>Shall injure or destroy; they shall not hurt<br/>In all my holy mountain saith the Lord.<br/>The earth in peace and ev'ry shadow fled,<br/>Bespeaks Emmanuel's happy reign when Jew,<br/>And kindred Gentile shall no more contend,<br/>Save in the holier strife of hymn and song,<br/>To him who leads captive captivity,<br/>Who shall collect the sons of Jacob's line,<br/>And bring the fulness of the Gentiles in.<br/>Thrice happy day when Gentiles are brought in<br/>Complete and full; when with its genial beams<br/>The day shall break on each benighted land<br/>Which yet in darkness and in vision lies:<br/>On Scythia and Tartary's bleak hills;<br/>On mount Imaus, and Hyrcanian cliffs<br/>Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;<br/>Japan and China, and the sea-girt isles<br/>The ancient Ophir deem'd; for there rich gems<br/>And diamond pearl, and purest gold is found.<br/><br/><br/>Thrice happy day when this whole earth shall feel<br/>The sacred ray of revelation shed,<br/>Far to the west, through each remotest land<br/>With equal glory rivalling the day<br/>Pour'd on the east. When these Americ shores<br/>Shall far and wide be light, and heav'nly day<br/>Shall in full glory rise on many a reign,<br/>Kingdom and empire bending to the south,<br/>And nation touching the Pacific shore.<br/>When Christian churches shall adorn the streams<br/>Which now unheeded flow with current swift<br/>Circling the hills, where fiercest beasts of prey,<br/>Panther and wolf in nightly concert howl.<br/>The Indian sage from superstition freed,<br/>Be taught a nobler heav'n than cloud-topt-hill,<br/>Or sep'rate island in the wat'ry waste.<br/>The aged Sachem fix his moving tribe,<br/>And grow humane now taught the arts of peace.<br/>In human sacrifice delight no more,<br/>Mad cantico or savage feast of war.<br/>Such scenes of fierce barbarity no more<br/>Be perpetrated there, but truth divine<br/>Shine on the earth in one long cloudless day,<br/>Till that last hour which shuts the scene of things,<br/>When this pure light shall claim its native skies;<br/>When the pure stream of revelation shall,<br/>With refluent current visit its first hills:<br/>There shall it mix with that crystalline wave,<br/>Which laves the walls of Paradise on high,<br/>And from beneath the seat of God doth spring.<br/>This is that river from whose sacred head<br/>The sanctified in golden arms draw light,<br/>On either side of which that tree doth grow<br/>Which yields immortal fruit, and in whose shade<br/>If shade were needed there, the rapt shall sing,<br/>In varied melody to harp and lyre,<br/>The sacred song of Moses and the Lamb:<br/>Eternity's high arches ring; 'Tis heard<br/>Through both infinitudes of space and time.<br/><br/><br/>Thus have I sung to this high-favour'd bow'r,<br/>And sacred shades which taught me first to sing,<br/>With grateful mind a tributary strain.<br/>Sweet grove no more I visit you, no more<br/>Beneath your shades shall meditate my lay.<br/>Adieu ye lawns and thou fair hill adieu,<br/>And you O shepherds, and ye graces fair<br/>With comely presence honouring the day,<br/>Far hence I go to some sequest'red vale<br/>By woody hill or shady mountain side,<br/>Where far from converse and the social band,<br/>My days shall pass inglorious away: [3]<br/>But this shall be my exultation still<br/>My chiefest merit and my only joy,<br/>That when the hunter on some western hill,<br/>Or furzy glade shall see my grassy tomb,<br/>And know the stream which mourns unheeded by,<br/>He for a moment shall repress his step,<br/>And say, There lies a Son of Nassau-Hall.
