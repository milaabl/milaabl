# üíÆ The Devil's Walk. a Ballad by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Once, early in the morning, Beelzebub arose,<br/>With care his sweet person adorning,<br/>He put on his Sunday clothes.<br/><br/>He drew on a boot to hide his hoof,<br/>He drew on a glove to hide his claw,<br/>His horns were concealed by a Bras Chapeau,<br/>And the Devil went forth as natty a Beau<br/>As Bond-street ever saw.<br/><br/>He sate him down, in London town,<br/>Before earth's morning ray;<br/>With a favourite imp he began to chat,<br/>On religion, and scandal, this and that,<br/>Until the dawn of day.<br/><br/>And then to St. James's Court he went,<br/>And St. Paul's Church he took on his way;<br/>He was mighty thick with every Saint,<br/>Though they were formal and he was gay.<br/><br/>The Devil was an agriculturist,<br/>And as bad weeds quickly grow,<br/>In looking over his farm, I wist,<br/>He wouldn't find cause for woe.<br/><br/>He peeped in each hole, to each chamber stole,<br/>His promising live-stock to view;<br/>Grinning applause, he just showed them his claws,<br/>And they shrunk with affright from his ugly sight,<br/>Whose work they delighted to do.<br/><br/>Satan poked his red nose into crannies so small<br/>One would think that the innocents fair,<br/>Poor lambkins! were just doing nothing at all<br/>But settling some dress or arranging some ball,<br/>But the Devil saw deeper there.<br/><br/>A Priest, at whose elbow the Devil during prayer<br/>Sate familiarly, side by side,<br/>Declared that, if the Tempter were there,<br/>His presence he would not abide.<br/>Ah! ah! thought Old Nick, that's a very stale trick,<br/>For without the Devil, O favourite of Evil,<br/>In your carriage you would not ride.<br/><br/>Satan next saw a brainless King,<br/>Whose house was as hot as his own;<br/>Many Imps in attendance were there on the wing,<br/>They flapped the pennon and twisted the sting,<br/>Close by the very Throne.<br/><br/>Ah! ah! thought Satan, the pasture is good,<br/>My Cattle will here thrive better than others;<br/>They dine on news of human blood,<br/>They sup on the groans of the dying and dead,<br/>And supperless never will go to bed;<br/>Which will make them fat as their brothers.<br/><br/>Fat as the Fiends that feed on blood,<br/>Fresh and warm from the fields of Spain,<br/>Where Ruin ploughs her gory way,<br/>Where the shoots of earth are nipped in the bud,<br/>Where Hell is the Victor's prey,<br/>Its glory the meed of the slain.<br/><br/>Fat--as the Death-birds on Erin's shore,<br/>That glutted themselves in her dearest gore,<br/>And flitted round Castlereagh,<br/>When they snatched the Patriot's heart, that HIS grasp<br/>Had torn from its widow's maniac clasp,<br/>--And fled at the dawn of day.<br/><br/>Fat--as the Reptiles of the tomb,<br/>That riot in corruption's spoil,<br/>That fret their little hour in gloom,<br/>And creep, and live the while.<br/><br/>Fat as that Prince's maudlin brain,<br/>Which, addled by some gilded toy,<br/>Tired, gives his sweetmeat, and again<br/>Cries for it, like a humoured boy.<br/><br/>For he is fat,--his waistcoat gay,<br/>When strained upon a levee day,<br/>Scarce meets across his princely paunch;<br/>And pantaloons are like half-moons<br/>Upon each brawny haunch.<br/><br/>How vast his stock of calf! when plenty<br/>Had filled his empty head and heart,<br/>Enough to satiate foplings twenty,<br/>Could make his pantaloon seams start.<br/><br/>The Devil (who sometimes is called Nature),<br/>For men of power provides thus well,<br/>Whilst every change and every feature,<br/>Their great original can tell.<br/><br/>Satan saw a lawyer a viper slay,<br/>That crawled up the leg of his table,<br/>It reminded him most marvellously<br/>Of the story of Cain and Abel.<br/><br/>The wealthy yeoman, as he wanders<br/>His fertile fields among,<br/>And on his thriving cattle ponders,<br/>Counts his sure gains, and hums a song;<br/>Thus did the Devil, through earth walking,<br/>Hum low a hellish song.<br/><br/>For they thrive well whose garb of gore<br/>Is Satan's choicest livery,<br/>And they thrive well who from the poor<br/>Have snatched the bread of penury,<br/>And heap the houseless wanderer's store<br/>On the rank pile of luxury.<br/><br/>The Bishops thrive, though they are big;<br/>The Lawyers thrive, though they are thin;<br/>For every gown, and every wig,<br/>Hides the safe thrift of Hell within.<br/><br/>Thus pigs were never counted clean,<br/>Although they dine on finest corn;<br/>And cormorants are sin-like lean,<br/>Although they eat from night to morn.<br/><br/>Oh! why is the Father of Hell in such glee,<br/>As he grins from ear to ear?<br/>Why does he doff his clothes joyfully,<br/>As he skips, and prances, and flaps his wing,<br/>As he sidles, leers, and twirls his sting,<br/>And dares, as he is, to appear?<br/><br/>A statesman passed--alone to him,<br/>The Devil dare his whole shape uncover,<br/>To show each feature, every limb,<br/>Secure of an unchanging lover.<br/><br/>At this known sign, a welcome sight,<br/>The watchful demons sought their King,<br/>And every Fiend of the Stygian night,<br/>Was in an instant on the wing.<br/><br/>Pale Loyalty, his guilt-steeled brow,<br/>With wreaths of gory laurel crowned:<br/>The hell-hounds, Murder, Want and Woe,<br/>Forever hungering, flocked around;<br/>From Spain had Satan sought their food,<br/>'Twas human woe and human blood!<br/><br/>Hark! the earthquake's crash I hear,--<br/>Kings turn pale, and Conquerors start,<br/>Ruffians tremble in their fear,<br/>For their Satan doth depart.<br/><br/>This day Fiends give to revelry<br/>To celebrate their King's return,<br/>And with delight its Sire to see<br/>Hell's adamantine limits burn.<br/><br/>But were the Devil's sight as keen<br/>As Reason's penetrating eye,<br/>His sulphurous Majesty I ween,<br/>Would find but little cause for joy.<br/><br/>For the sons of Reason see<br/>That, ere fate consume the Pole,<br/>The false Tyrant's cheek shall be<br/>Bloodless as his coward soul.
