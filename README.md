# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Shipman's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE<br/><br/>Our Host upon his stirrups stood anon,<br/>And saide; "Good men, hearken every one,<br/>This was a thrifty tale for the nones.<br/>Sir Parish Priest," quoth he, "for Godde's bones,<br/>Tell us a tale, as was thy forword yore:<br/>I see well that ye learned men in lore<br/>Can muche good, by Godde's dignity."<br/>The Parson him answer'd, "Ben'dicite!<br/>What ails the man, so sinfully to swear?"<br/>Our Host answer'd, "O Jankin, be ye there?<br/>Now, good men," quoth our Host, "hearken to me.<br/>I smell a Lollard  in the wind," quoth he.<br/>"Abide, for Godde's digne passion,<br/>For we shall have a predication:<br/>This Lollard here will preachen us somewhat."<br/>"Nay, by my father's soul, that shall he not,<br/>Saide the Shipman; "Here shall he not preach,<br/>He shall no gospel glose here nor teach.<br/>We all believe in the great God," quoth he.<br/>"He woulde sowe some difficulty,<br/>Or springe cockle  in our cleane corn.<br/>And therefore, Host, I warne thee beforn,<br/>My jolly body shall a tale tell,<br/>And I shall clinke you so merry a bell,<br/>That I shall waken all this company;<br/>But it shall not be of philosophy,<br/>Nor of physic, nor termes quaint of law;<br/>There is but little Latin in my maw."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>A Merchant whilom dwell'd at Saint Denise,<br/>That riche was, for which men held him wise.<br/>A wife he had of excellent beauty,<br/>And companiable and revellous was she,<br/>Which is a thing that causeth more dispence<br/>Than worth is all the cheer and reverence<br/>That men them do at feastes and at dances.<br/>Such salutations and countenances<br/>Passen, as doth the shadow on the wall;<br/>Put woe is him that paye must for all.<br/>The sely husband algate he must pay,<br/>He must us  clothe and he must us array<br/>All for his owen worship richely:<br/>In which array we dance jollily.<br/>And if that he may not, paraventure,<br/>Or elles list not such dispence endure,<br/>But thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,<br/>Then must another paye for our cost,<br/>Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.<br/><br/>This noble merchant held a noble house;<br/>For which he had all day so great repair,<br/>For his largesse, and for his wife was fair,<br/>That wonder is; but hearken to my tale.<br/>Amonges all these guestes great and smale,<br/>There was a monk, a fair man and a bold,<br/>I trow a thirty winter he was old,<br/>That ever-in-one was drawing to that place.<br/>This younge monk, that was so fair of face,<br/>Acquainted was so with this goode man,<br/>Since that their firste knowledge began,<br/>That in his house as familiar was he<br/>As it is possible any friend to be.<br/>And, for as muchel as this goode man,<br/>And eke this monk of which that I began,<br/>Were both the two y-born in one village,<br/>The monk him claimed, as for cousinage,<br/>And he again him said not once nay,<br/>But was as glad thereof as fowl of day;<br/>"For to his heart it was a great pleasance.<br/>Thus be they knit with etern' alliance,<br/>And each of them gan other to assure<br/>Of brotherhood while that their life may dure.<br/><br/>As in that house, and full of diligence<br/>To do pleasance, and also great costage;<br/>He not forgot to give the leaste page<br/>In all that house; but, after their degree,<br/>He gave the lord, and sithen his meinie,<br/>When that he came, some manner honest thing;<br/>For which they were as glad of his coming<br/>As fowl is fain when that the sun upriseth.<br/>No more of this as now, for it sufficeth.<br/><br/>But so befell, this merchant on a day<br/>Shope him to make ready his array<br/>Toward the town of Bruges  for to fare,<br/>To buye there a portion of ware;<br/>For which he hath to Paris sent anon<br/>A messenger, and prayed hath Dan John<br/>That he should come to Saint Denis, and play<br/>With him, and with his wife, a day or tway,<br/>Ere he to Bruges went, in alle wise.<br/>This noble monk, of which I you devise,<br/>Had of his abbot, as him list, licence,<br/>(Because he was a man of high prudence,<br/>And eke an officer out for to ride,<br/>To see their granges and their barnes wide);<br/>And unto Saint Denis he came anon.<br/>Who was so welcome as my lord Dan John,<br/>Our deare cousin, full of courtesy?<br/>With him he brought a jub of malvesie,<br/>And eke another full of fine vernage,<br/>And volatile, as aye was his usage:<br/>And thus I let them eat, and drink, and play,<br/>This merchant and this monk, a day or tway.<br/>The thirde day the merchant up ariseth,<br/>And on his needeis sadly him adviseth;<br/>And up into his countour-house went he,<br/>To reckon with himself as well may be,<br/>Of thilke year, how that it with him stood,<br/>And how that he dispended bad his good,<br/>And if that he increased were or non.<br/>His bookes and his bagges many a one<br/>He laid before him on his counting-board.<br/>Full riche was his treasure and his hoard;<br/>For which full fast his countour door he shet;<br/>And eke he would that no man should him let<br/>Of his accountes, for the meane time:<br/>And thus he sat, till it was passed prime.<br/><br/>Dan John was risen in the morn also,<br/>And in the garden walked to and fro,<br/>And had his thinges said full courteously.<br/>The good wife came walking full privily<br/>Into the garden, where he walked soft,<br/>And him saluted, as she had done oft;<br/>A maiden child came in her company,<br/>Which as her list she might govern and gie,<br/>For yet under the yarde was the maid.<br/>"O deare cousin mine, Dan John," she said,<br/>"What aileth you so rath for to arise?"<br/>"Niece," quoth he, "it ought enough suffice<br/>Five houres for to sleep upon a night;'<br/>But it were for an old appalled wight,<br/>As be these wedded men, that lie and dare,<br/>As in a forme sits a weary hare,<br/>Alle forstraught with houndes great and smale;<br/>But, deare niece, why be ye so pale?<br/>I trowe certes that our goode man<br/>Hath you so laboured, since this night began,<br/>That you were need to reste hastily."<br/>And with that word he laugh'd full merrily,<br/>And of his owen thought he wax'd all red.<br/>This faire wife gan for to shake her head,<br/>And saide thus; "Yea, God wot all" quoth she.<br/>"Nay, cousin mine, it stands not so with me;<br/>For by that God, that gave me soul and life,<br/>In all the realm of France is there no wife<br/>That lesse lust hath to that sorry play;<br/>For I may sing alas and well-away!<br/>That I was born; but to no wight," quoth she,<br/>"Dare I not tell how that it stands with me.<br/>Wherefore I think out of this land to wend,<br/>Or elles of myself to make an end,<br/>So full am I of dread and eke of care."<br/><br/>This monk began upon this wife to stare,<br/>And said, "Alas! my niece, God forbid<br/>That ye for any sorrow, or any dread,<br/>Fordo yourself: but telle me your grief,<br/>Paraventure I may, in your mischief,<br/>Counsel or help; and therefore telle me<br/>All your annoy, for it shall be secre.<br/>For on my portos here I make an oath,<br/>That never in my life, for lief nor loth,<br/>Ne shall I of no counsel you bewray."<br/>"The same again to you," quoth she, "I say.<br/>By God and by this portos I you swear,<br/>Though men me woulden all in pieces tear,<br/>Ne shall I never, for to go to hell,<br/>Bewray one word of thing that ye me tell,<br/>For no cousinage, nor alliance,<br/>But verily for love and affiance."<br/>Thus be they sworn, and thereupon they kiss'd,<br/>And each of them told other what them list.<br/>"Cousin," quoth she, "if that I hadde space,<br/>As I have none, and namely in this place,<br/>Then would I tell a legend of my life,<br/>What I have suffer'd since I was a wife<br/>With mine husband, all be he your cousin.<br/>"Nay," quoth this monk, "by God and Saint Martin,<br/>He is no more cousin unto me,<br/>Than is the leaf that hangeth on the tree;<br/>I call him so, by Saint Denis of France,<br/>To have the more cause of acquaintance<br/>Of you, which I have loved specially<br/>Aboven alle women sickerly,<br/>This swear I you on my professioun;<br/>Tell me your grief, lest that he come adown,<br/>And hasten you, and go away anon."<br/><br/>"My deare love," quoth she, "O my Dan John,<br/>Full lief were me this counsel for to hide,<br/>But out it must, I may no more abide.<br/>My husband is to me the worste man<br/>That ever was since that the world began;<br/>But since I am a wife, it sits not me<br/>To telle no wight of our privity,<br/>Neither in bed, nor in none other place;<br/>God shield I shoulde tell it for his grace;<br/>A wife shall not say of her husband<br/>But all honour, as I can understand;<br/>Save unto you thus much I telle shall;<br/>As help me God, he is nought worth at all<br/>In no degree, the value of a fly.<br/>But yet me grieveth most his niggardy.<br/>And well ye wot, that women naturally<br/>Desire thinges six, as well as I.<br/>They woulde that their husbands shoulde be<br/>Hardy, and wise, and rich, and thereto free,<br/>And buxom to his wife, and fresh in bed.<br/>But, by that ilke Lord that for us bled,<br/>For his honour myself for to array,<br/>On Sunday next I muste needes pay<br/>A hundred francs, or elles am I lorn.<br/>Yet were me lever that I were unborn,<br/>Than me were done slander or villainy.<br/>And if mine husband eke might it espy,<br/>I were but lost; and therefore I you pray,<br/>Lend me this sum, or elles must I dey.<br/>Dan John, I say, lend me these hundred francs;<br/>Pardie, I will not faile you, my thanks,<br/>If that you list to do that I you pray;<br/>For at a certain day I will you pay,<br/>And do to you what pleasance and service<br/>That I may do, right as you list devise.<br/>And but I do, God take on me vengeance,<br/>As foul as e'er had Ganilion  of France."<br/><br/>This gentle monk answer'd in this mannere;<br/>"Now truely, mine owen lady dear,<br/>I have," quoth he, "on you so greate ruth,<br/>That I you swear, and plighte you my truth,<br/>That when your husband is to Flanders fare,<br/>I will deliver you out of this care,<br/>For I will bringe you a hundred francs."<br/>And with that word he caught her by the flanks,<br/>And her embraced hard, and kissed her oft.<br/>"Go now your way," quoth he, "all still and soft,<br/>And let us dine as soon as that ye may,<br/>For by my cylinder 'tis prime of day;<br/>Go now, and be as true as I shall be ."<br/>"Now elles God forbidde, Sir," quoth she;<br/>And forth she went, as jolly as a pie,<br/>And bade the cookes that they should them hie,<br/>So that men mighte dine, and that anon.<br/>Up to her husband is this wife gone,<br/>And knocked at his contour boldely.<br/>"Qui est la?" quoth he. "Peter! it am I,"<br/>Quoth she; "What, Sir, how longe all will ye fast?<br/>How longe time will ye reckon and cast<br/>Your summes, and your bookes, and your things?<br/>The devil have part of all such reckonings!<br/>Ye have enough, pardie, of Godde's sond.<br/>Come down to-day, and let your bagges stond.<br/>Ne be ye not ashamed, that Dan John<br/>Shall fasting all this day elenge gon?<br/>What? let us hear a mass, and go we dine."<br/>"Wife," quoth this man, "little canst thou divine<br/>The curious businesse that we have;<br/>For of us chapmen, all so God me save,<br/>And by that lord that cleped is Saint Ive,<br/>Scarcely amonges twenty, ten shall thrive<br/>Continually, lasting unto our age.<br/>We may well make cheer and good visage,<br/>And drive forth the world as it may be,<br/>And keepen our estate in privity,<br/>Till we be dead, or elles that we play<br/>A pilgrimage, or go out of the way.<br/>And therefore have I great necessity<br/>Upon this quaint world to advise me.<br/>For evermore must we stand in dread<br/>Of hap and fortune in our chapmanhead.<br/>To Flanders will I go to-morrow at day,<br/>And come again as soon as e'er I may:<br/>For which, my deare wife, I thee beseek<br/>As be to every wight buxom and meek,<br/>And for to keep our good be curious,<br/>And honestly governe well our house.<br/>Thou hast enough, in every manner wise,<br/>That to a thrifty household may suffice.<br/>Thee lacketh none array, nor no vitail;<br/>Of silver in thy purse thou shalt not fail."<br/><br/>And with that word his contour door he shet,<br/>And down he went; no longer would he let;<br/>And hastily a mass was there said,<br/>And speedily the tables were laid,<br/>And to the dinner faste they them sped,<br/>And richely this monk the chapman fed.<br/>And after dinner Dan John soberly<br/>This chapman took apart, and privily<br/>He said him thus: "Cousin, it standeth so,<br/>That, well I see, to Bruges ye will go;<br/>God and Saint Austin speede you and guide.<br/>I pray you, cousin, wisely that ye ride:<br/>Governe you also of your diet<br/>Attemperly, and namely in this heat.<br/>Betwixt us two needeth no strange fare;<br/>Farewell, cousin, God shielde you from care.<br/>If any thing there be, by day or night,<br/>If it lie in my power and my might,<br/>That ye me will command in any wise,<br/>It shall be done, right as ye will devise.<br/>But one thing ere ye go, if it may be;<br/>I woulde pray you for to lend to me<br/>A hundred frankes, for a week or twy,<br/>For certain beastes that I muste buy,<br/>To store with a place that is ours<br/>(God help me so, I would that it were yours);<br/>I shall not faile surely of my day,<br/>Not for a thousand francs, a mile way.<br/>But let this thing be secret, I you pray;<br/>For yet to-night these beastes must I buy.<br/>And fare now well, mine owen cousin dear;<br/>Grand mercy of your cost and of your cheer."<br/><br/>This noble merchant gentilly anon<br/>Answer'd and said, "O cousin mine, Dan John,<br/>Now sickerly this is a small request:<br/>My gold is youres, when that it you lest,<br/>And not only my gold, but my chaffare;<br/>Take what you list, God shielde that ye spare.<br/>But one thing is, ye know it well enow<br/>Of chapmen, that their money is their plough.<br/>We may creance while we have a name,<br/>But goldless for to be it is no game.<br/>Pay it again when it lies in your ease;<br/>After my might full fain would I you please."<br/><br/>These hundred frankes set he forth anon,<br/>And privily he took them to Dan John;<br/>No wight in all this world wist of this loan,<br/>Saving the merchant and Dan John alone.<br/>They drink, and speak, and roam a while, and play,<br/>Till that Dan John rode unto his abbay.<br/>The morrow came, and forth this merchant rideth<br/>To Flanders-ward, his prentice well him guideth,<br/>Till he came unto Bruges merrily.<br/>Now went this merchant fast and busily<br/>About his need, and buyed and creanced;<br/>He neither played at the dice, nor danced;<br/>But as a merchant, shortly for to tell,<br/>He led his life; and there I let him dwell.<br/><br/>The Sunday next the merchant was y-gone,<br/>To Saint Denis y-comen is Dan John,<br/>With crown and beard all fresh and newly shave,<br/>In all the house was not so little a knave,<br/>Nor no wight elles that was not full fain<br/>For that my lord Dan John was come again.<br/>And shortly to the point right for to gon,<br/>The faire wife accorded with Dan John,<br/>That for these hundred francs he should all night<br/>Have her in his armes bolt upright;<br/>And this accord performed was in deed.<br/>In mirth all night a busy life they lead,<br/>Till it was day, that Dan John went his way,<br/>And bade the meinie "Farewell; have good day."<br/>For none of them, nor no wight in the town,<br/>Had of Dan John right no suspicioun;<br/>And forth he rode home to his abbay,<br/>Or where him list; no more of him I say.<br/><br/>The merchant, when that ended was the fair,<br/>To Saint Denis he gan for to repair,<br/>And with his wife he made feast and cheer,<br/>And tolde her that chaffare was so dear,<br/>That needes must he make a chevisance;<br/>For he was bound in a recognisance<br/>To paye twenty thousand shields anon.<br/>For which this merchant is to Paris gone,<br/>To borrow of certain friendes that he had<br/>A certain francs, and some with him he lad.<br/>And when that he was come into the town,<br/>For great cherte and great affectioun<br/>Unto Dan John he wente first to play;<br/>Not for to borrow of him no money,<br/>Bat for to weet and see of his welfare,<br/>And for to telle him of his chaffare,<br/>As friendes do, when they be met in fere.<br/>Dan John him made feast and merry cheer;<br/>And he him told again full specially,<br/>How he had well y-bought and graciously<br/>(Thanked be God) all whole his merchandise;<br/>Save that he must, in alle manner wise,<br/>Maken a chevisance, as for his best;<br/>And then he shoulde be in joy and rest.<br/>Dan John answered, "Certes, I am fain<br/>That ye in health be come borne again:<br/>And if that I were rich, as have I bliss,<br/>Of twenty thousand shields should ye not miss,<br/>For ye so kindely the other day<br/>Lente me gold, and as I can and may<br/>I thanke you, by God and by Saint Jame.<br/>But natheless I took unto our Dame,<br/>Your wife at home, the same gold again,<br/>Upon your bench; she wot it well, certain,<br/>By certain tokens that I can her tell<br/>Now, by your leave, I may no longer dwell;<br/>Our abbot will out of this town anon,<br/>And in his company I muste gon.<br/>Greet well our Dame, mine owen niece sweet,<br/>And farewell, deare cousin, till we meet.<br/><br/>This merchant, which that was full ware and wise,<br/>Creanced hath, and paid eke in Paris<br/>To certain Lombards ready in their hond<br/>The sum of gold, and got of them his bond,<br/>And home he went, merry as a popinjay.<br/>For well he knew he stood in such array<br/>That needes must he win in that voyage<br/>A thousand francs, above all his costage.<br/>His wife full ready met him at the gate,<br/>As she was wont of old usage algate<br/>And all that night in mirthe they beset;<br/>For he was rich, and clearly out of debt.<br/>When it was day, the merchant gan embrace<br/>His wife all new, and kiss'd her in her face,<br/>And up he went, and maked it full tough.<br/><br/>"No more," quoth she, "by God ye have enough;"<br/>And wantonly again with him she play'd,<br/>Till at the last this merchant to her said.<br/>"By God," quoth he, "I am a little wroth<br/>With you, my wife, although it be me loth;<br/>And wot ye why? by God, as that I guess,<br/>That ye have made a manner strangeness<br/>Betwixte me and my cousin, Dan John.<br/>Ye should have warned me, ere I had gone,<br/>That he you had a hundred frankes paid<br/>By ready token; he had him evil apaid<br/>For that I to him spake of chevisance,<br/>(He seemed so as by his countenance);<br/>But natheless, by God of heaven king,<br/>I thoughte not to ask of him no thing.<br/>I pray thee, wife, do thou no more so.<br/>Tell me alway, ere that I from thee go,<br/>If any debtor hath in mine absence<br/>Y-payed thee, lest through thy negligence<br/>I might him ask a thing that he hath paid."<br/><br/>This wife was not afeared nor afraid,<br/>But boldely she said, and that anon;<br/>"Mary! I defy that false monk Dan John,<br/>I keep not of his tokens never a deal:<br/>He took me certain gold, I wot it well. --<br/>What? evil thedom on his monke's snout! --<br/>For, God it wot, I ween'd withoute doubt<br/>That he had given it me, because of you,<br/>To do therewith mine honour and my prow,<br/>For cousinage, and eke for belle cheer<br/>That he hath had full often here.<br/>But since I see I stand in such disjoint,<br/>I will answer you shortly to the point.<br/>Ye have more slacke debtors than am I;<br/>For I will pay you well and readily,<br/>From day to day, and if so be I fail,<br/>I am your wife, score it upon my tail,<br/>And I shall pay as soon as ever I may.<br/>For, by my troth, I have on mine array,<br/>And not in waste, bestow'd it every deal.<br/>And, for I have bestowed it so well,<br/>For your honour, for Godde's sake I say,<br/>As be not wroth, but let us laugh and play.<br/>Ye shall my jolly body have to wed;<br/>By God, I will not pay you but in bed;<br/>Forgive it me, mine owen spouse dear;<br/>Turn hitherward, and make better cheer."<br/><br/>The merchant saw none other remedy;<br/>And for to chide, it were but a folly,<br/>Since that the thing might not amended be.<br/>"Now, wife," he said, "and I forgive it thee;<br/>But by thy life be no more so large;<br/>Keep better my good, this give I thee in charge."<br/>Thus endeth now my tale; and God us send<br/>Taling enough, until our lives' end!
