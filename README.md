<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ One Word More: To E.B.B. by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    There they are, my fifty men and women<br/>Naming me the fifty poems finished!<br/>Take them, Love, the book and me together;<br/>Where the heart lies, let the brain lie also.<br/><br/>Rafael made a century of sonnets,<br/>Made and wrote them in a certain volume<br/>Dinted with the silver-pointed pencil<br/>Else he only used to draw Madonnas;<br/>These, the world might view--but one, the volume.<br/>Who that one, you ask? Your heart instructs you.<br/>Did she live and love it all her lifetime?<br/>Did she drop, his lady of the sonnets,<br/>Die, and let it drop beside her pillow<br/>Where it lay in place of Rafael's glory,<br/>Rafael's cheek so duteous and so loving--<br/>Cheek, the world was wont to hail a painter's,<br/>Rafael's cheek, her love had turned a poet's?<br/><br/>You and I would rather read that volume<br/>(Taken to his beating bosom by it),<br/>Lean and list the bosom-beats of Rafael,<br/>Would we not? than wonder at Madonnas--<br/>Her, San Sisto names, and Her, Foligno,<br/>Her, that visits Florence in a vision,<br/>Her, that's left with lilies in the Louvre--<br/>Seen by us and all the world in circle.<br/><br/>You and I will never read that volume.<br/>Guido Reni, like his own eye's apple,<br/>Guarded long the treasure-book and loved it.<br/>Guido Reni dying, all Bologna<br/>Cried, and the world cried too, "Ours, the treasure!"<br/>Suddenly, as rare things will, it vanished.<br/><br/>Dante once prepared to paint an angel:<br/>Whom to please? You whisper "Beatrice."<br/>While he mused and traced it and retraced it<br/>(Peradventure with a pen corroded<br/>Still by drops of that hot ink he dipped for,<br/>When, his left-hand i' the hair o' the wicked,<br/>Back he held the brow and pricked its stigma,<br/>Bit into the live man's flesh for parchment,<br/>Loosed him, laughed to see the writing rankle,<br/>Let the wretch go festering through Florence)--<br/>Dante, who loved well because he hated,<br/>Hated wickedness that hinders loving,<br/>Dante, standing, studying his angel,--<br/>In there broke the folk of his Inferno.<br/>Says he--"Certain people of importance"<br/>(Such he gave his daily dreadful line to)<br/>"Entered and would seize, forsooth, the poet."<br/>Says the poet--"Then I stopped my painting."<br/><br/>You and I would rather see that angel,<br/>Painted by the tenderness of Dante,<br/>Would we not?--than read a fresh Inferno.<br/><br/>You and I will never see that picture.<br/>While he mused on love and Beatrice,<br/>While he softened o'er his outlined angel,<br/>In they broke, those "people of importance":<br/>We and Bice bear the loss forever.<br/><br/>What of Rafael's sonnets, Dante's picture?<br/>This: no artist lives and loves, that longs not<br/>Once, and only once, and for one only,<br/>(Ah, the prize!) to find his love a language<br/>Fit and fair and simple and sufficient--<br/>Using nature that's an art to others,<br/>Not, this one time, art that's turned his nature.<br/>Ay, of all the artists living, loving,<br/>None but would forego his proper dowry,--<br/>Does he paint? he fain would write a poem,<br/>Does he write? he fain would paint a picture,--<br/>Put to proof art alien to the artist's,<br/>Once, and only once, and for one only,<br/>So to be the man and leave the artist,<br/>Gain the man's joy, miss the artist's sorrow.<br/><br/>Wherefore? Heaven's gift takes earth's abatement!<br/>He who smites the rock and spreads the water,<br/>Bidding drink and live a crowd beneath him,<br/>Even he, the minute makes immortal,<br/>Proves, perchance, but mortal in the minute,<br/>Desecrates, belike, the deed in doing.<br/>While he smites, how can he but remember,<br/>So he smote before, in such a peril,<br/>When they stood and mocked--"Shall smiting help us?"<br/>When they drank and sneered--"A stroke is easy!"<br/>When they wiped their mouths and went their journey,<br/>Throwing him for thanks--"But drought was pleasant."<br/>Thus old memories mar the actual triumph;<br/>Thus the doing savors of disrelish;<br/>Thus achievement lacks a gracious somewhat;<br/>O'er-importuned brows becloud the mandate,<br/>Carelessness or consciousness--the gesture.<br/>For he bears an ancient wrong about him,<br/>Sees and knows again those phalanxed faces,<br/>Hears, yet one time more, the 'customed prelude--<br/>"How shouldst thou, of all men, smite, and save us?"<br/>Guesses what is like to prove the sequel--<br/>"Egypt's flesh-pots--nay, the drought was better."<br/><br/>Oh, the crowd must have emphatic warrant!<br/>Theirs, the Sinai-forhead's cloven brilliance,<br/>Right-arm's rod-sweep, tongue's imperial fiat.<br/>Never dares the man put off the prophet.<br/><br/>Did he love one face from out the thousands,<br/>(Were she Jethro's daughter, white and wifely,<br/>Were she but the √Üthiopian bondslave),<br/>He would envy yon dumb, patient camel,<br/>Keeping a reserve of scanty water<br/>Meant to save his own life in the desert;<br/>Ready in the desert to deliver<br/>(Kneeling down to let his breast be opened)<br/>Hoard and life together for his mistress.<br/><br/>I shall never, in the years remaining,<br/>Paint you pictures, no, nor carve you statues.<br/>Make you music that should all-express me;<br/>So it seems; I stand on my attainment.<br/>This of verse alone, one life allows me;<br/>Verse and nothing else have I to give you;<br/>Other heights in other lives, God willing;<br/>All the gifts from all the heights, your own, Love.<br/><br/>Yet a semblance of resource avails us--<br/>Shade so finely touched, love's sense must seize it.<br/>Take these lines, look lovingly and nearly,<br/>Lines I write the first time and the last time.<br/>He who works in fresco steals a hair-brush,<br/>Curbs the liberal hand, subservient proudly,<br/>Cramps his spirit, crowds its all in little,<br/>Makes a strange art of an art familiar,<br/>Fills his lady's missal-marge with flowerets,<br/>He who blows through bronze may breathe through silver,<br/>Fitly serenade a slumbrous princess.<br/>He who writes, may write for once as I do.<br/><br/>Love, you saw me gather men and women,<br/>Live or dead or fashioned by my fancy,<br/>Enter each and all, and use their service,<br/>Speak from every mouth,--the speech, a poem.<br/>Hardly shall I tell my joys and sorrows,<br/>Hopes and fears, belief and disbelieving:<br/>I am mine and yours--the rest be all men's,<br/>Karshish, Cleon, Norbert, and the fifty.<br/>Let me speak this once in my true person,<br/>Not as Lippo, Roland, or Andrea,<br/>Though the fruit of speech be just this sentence:<br/>Pray you, look on these my men and women,<br/>Take and keep my fifty poems finished;<br/>Where my heart lies, let my brain lie also!<br/>Poor the speech; be how I speak, for all things.<br/><br/>Not but that you know me! Lo, the moon's self!<br/>Here in London, yonder late in Florence,<br/>Still we find her face, the thrice-transfigured.<br/>Curving on a sky imbrued with color,<br/>Drifted over Fiesole by twilight,<br/>Came she, our new crescent of a hair's-breadth.<br/>Full she flared it, lamping Samminiato,<br/>Rounder 'twixt the cypresses and rounder,<br/>Perfect till the nightingales applauded.<br/>Now, a piece of her old self, impoverished,<br/>Hard to greet, she traverses the house-roofs,<br/>Hurries with unhandsome thrift of silver,<br/>Goes dispiritedly, glad to finish.<br/><br/>What, there's nothing in the moon noteworthy?<br/>Nay: for if that moon could love a mortal,<br/>Use, to charm him (so to fit a fancy),<br/>All her magic ('tis the old sweet mythos),<br/>She would turn a new side to her mortal,<br/>Side unseen of herdsman, huntsman, steersman,--<br/>Blank to Zoroaster on his terrace,<br/>Blind to Galileo on his turret.<br/>Dumb to Homer, dumb to Keats--him, even!<br/>Think, the wonder of the moonstruck mortal--<br/>When she turns round, comes again in heaven,<br/>Opens out anew for worse or better!<br/>Proves she like some portent of an iceberg<br/>Swimming full upon the ship it founders,<br/>Hungry with huge teeth of splintered crystals?<br/>Proves she as the paved work of a sapphire,<br/>Seen by Moses when he climbed the mountain?<br/>Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu<br/>Climbed and saw the very God, the Highest,<br/>Stand upon the paved work of a sapphire.<br/>Like the bodied heaven in his clearness<br/>Shone the stone, the sapphire of that paved work,<br/>When they ate and drank and saw God also!<br/><br/>What were seen? None knows, none ever will know.<br/>Only this is sure--the sight were other,<br/>Not the moon's same side, born late in Florence,<br/>Dying now impoverished here in London.<br/>God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures<br/>Boasts two soul-sides, one to face the world with,<br/>One to show a woman when he loves her.<br/><br/>This I say of me, but think of you, Love!<br/>This to you--yourself my moon of poets!<br/>Ah, but that's the world's side, there's the wonder,<br/>Thus they see you, praise you, think they know you!<br/>There, in turn I stand with them and praise you--<br/>Out of my own self, I dare to phrase it.<br/>But the best is when I glide from out them,<br/>Cross a step or two of dubious twilight,<br/>Come out on the other side, the novel<br/>Silent silver lights and darks undreamed of,<br/>Where I hush and bless myself with silence.<br/><br/>Oh, their Rafael of the dear Madonnas,<br/>Oh, their Dante of the dread Inferno,<br/>Wrote one song--and in my brain I sing it,<br/>Drew one angel--borne, see, on my bosom!
