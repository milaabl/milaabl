# üíÆ Oedipus Tyrannus or Swellfoot the Tyrant. a Tragedy in Two Acts by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL DORIC.<br/><br/>'Choose Reform or Civil War,<br/>When through thy streets, instead of hare with dogs,<br/>A CONSORT-QUEEN shall hunt a king with hogs,<br/>Riding on the IONIAN MINOTAUR.'<br/><br/>SCENE.--THEBES.<br/><br/>ACT 1.<br/><br/>SCENE 1.1.--A MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE, BUILT OF THIGH-BONES AND<br/>DEATH'S-HEADS, AND TILED WITH SCALPS. OVER THE ALTAR THE STATUE OF<br/>FAMINE, VEILED; A NUMBER OF BOARS, SOWS, AND SUCKING-PIGS, CROWNED<br/>WITH THISTLE, SHAMROCK, AND OAK, SITTING ON THE STEPS, AND CLINGING<br/>ROUND THE ALTAR OF THE TEMPLE.<br/><br/>ENTER SWELLFOOT, IN HIS ROYAL ROBES, WITHOUT PERCEIVING THE PIGS.<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Thou supreme Goddess! by whose power divine<br/>These graceful limbs are clothed in proud array<br/>[HE CONTEMPLATES HIMSELF WITH SATISFACTION.]<br/>Of gold and purple, and this kingly paunch<br/>Swells like a sail before a favouring breeze,<br/>And these most sacred nether promontories<br/>Lie satisfied with layers of fat; and these<br/>Boeotian cheeks, like Egypt's pyramid,<br/>(Nor with less toil were their foundations laid),<br/>Sustain the cone of my untroubled brain,<br/>That point, the emblem of a pointless nothing!<br/>Thou to whom Kings and laurelled Emperors,<br/>Radical-butchers, Paper-money-millers,<br/>Bishops and Deacons, and the entire army<br/>Of those fat martyrs to the persecution<br/>Of stifling turtle-soup, and brandy-devils,<br/>Offer their secret vows! Thou plenteous Ceres<br/>Of their Eleusis, hail!<br/><br/>SWINE:<br/>Eigh! eigh! eigh! eigh!<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Ha! what are ye,<br/>Who, crowned with leaves devoted to the Furies,<br/>Cling round this sacred shrine?<br/><br/>SWINE:<br/>Aigh! aigh! aigh!<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>What! ye that are<br/>The very beasts that, offered at her altar<br/>With blood and groans, salt-cake, and fat, and inwards,<br/>Ever propitiate her reluctant will<br/>When taxes are withheld?<br/><br/>SWINE:<br/>Ugh! ugh! ugh!<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>What! ye who grub<br/>With filthy snouts my red potatoes up<br/>In Allan's rushy bog? Who eat the oats<br/>Up, from my cavalry in the Hebrides?<br/>Who swill the hog-wash soup my cooks digest<br/>From bones, and rags, and scraps of shoe-leather,<br/>Which should be given to cleaner Pigs than you?<br/><br/>SWINE--SEMICHORUS 1:<br/>The same, alas! the same;<br/>Though only now the name<br/>Of Pig remains to me.<br/><br/>SEMICHORUS 2:<br/>If 'twere your kingly will<br/>Us wretched Swine to kill,<br/>What should we yield to thee?<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Why, skin and bones, and some few hairs for mortar.<br/><br/>CHORUS OF SWINE:<br/>I have heard your Laureate sing,<br/>That pity was a royal thing;<br/>Under your mighty ancestors, we Pigs<br/>Were bless'd as nightingales on myrtle sprigs,<br/>Or grasshoppers that live on noonday dew,<br/>And sung, old annals tell, as sweetly too;<br/>But now our sties are fallen in, we catch<br/>The murrain and the mange, the scab and itch;<br/>Sometimes your royal dogs tear down our thatch,<br/>And then we seek the shelter of a ditch;<br/>Hog-wash or grains, or ruta-baga, none<br/>Has yet been ours since your reign begun.<br/><br/>FIRST SOW:<br/>My Pigs, 'tis in vain to tug.<br/><br/>SECOND SOW:<br/>I could almost eat my litter.<br/><br/>FIRST PIG:<br/>I suck, but no milk will come from the dug.<br/><br/>SECOND PIG:<br/>Our skin and our bones would be bitter.<br/><br/>THE BOARS:<br/>We fight for this rag of greasy rug,<br/>Though a trough of wash would be fitter.<br/><br/>SEMICHORUS:<br/>Happier Swine were they than we,<br/>Drowned in the Gadarean sea--<br/>I wish that pity would drive out the devils,<br/>Which in your royal bosom hold their revels,<br/>And sink us in the waves of thy compassion!<br/>Alas! the Pigs are an unhappy nation!<br/>Now if your Majesty would have our bristles<br/>To bind your mortar with, or fill our colons<br/>With rich blood, or make brawn out of our gristles,<br/>In policy--ask else your royal Solons--<br/>You ought to give us hog-wash and clean straw,<br/>And sties well thatched; besides it is the law!<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>This is sedition, and rank blasphemy!<br/>Ho! there, my guards!<br/><br/>[ENTER A GUARD.]<br/><br/>GUARD:<br/>Your sacred Majesty.<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Call in the Jews, Solomon the court porkman,<br/>Moses the sow-gelder, and Zephaniah<br/>The hog-butcher.<br/><br/>GUARD:<br/>They are in waiting, Sire.<br/><br/>[ENTER SOLOMON, MOSES, AND ZEPHANIAH.]<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Out with your knife, old Moses, and spay those Sows<br/>[THE PIGS RUN ABOUT IN CONSTERNATION.]<br/>That load the earth with Pigs; cut close and deep.<br/>Moral restraint I see has no effect,<br/>Nor prostitution, nor our own example,<br/>Starvation, typhus-fever, war, nor prison--<br/>This was the art which the arch-priest of Famine<br/>Hinted at in his charge to the Theban clergy--<br/>Cut close and deep, good Moses.<br/><br/>MOSES:<br/>Let your Majesty<br/>Keep the Boars quiet, else--<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Zephaniah, cut<br/>That fat Hog's throat, the brute seems overfed;<br/>Seditious hunks! to whine for want of grains.<br/><br/>ZEPHANIAH:<br/>Your sacred Majesty, he has the dropsy;--<br/>We shall find pints of hydatids in 's liver,<br/>He has not half an inch of wholesome fat<br/>Upon his carious ribs--<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>'Tis all the same,<br/>He'll serve instead of riot money, when<br/>Our murmuring troops bivouac in Thebes' streets<br/>And January winds, after a day<br/>Of butchering, will make them relish carrion.<br/>Now, Solomon, I'll sell you in a lump<br/>The whole kit of them.<br/><br/>SOLOMON:<br/>Why, your Majesty,<br/>I could not give--<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Kill them out of the way,<br/>That shall be price enough, and let me hear<br/>Their everlasting grunts and whines no more!<br/><br/>[EXEUNT, DRIVING IN THE SWINE.<br/>ENTER MAMM0N, THE ARCH-PRIEST,<br/>AND PURGANAX, CHIEF OF THE COUNCIL OF WIZARDS.]<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>The future looks as black as death, a cloud,<br/>Dark as the frown of Hell, hangs over it--<br/>The troops grow mutinous--the revenue fails--<br/>There's something rotten in us--for the level<br/>Of the State slopes, its very bases topple,<br/>The boldest turn their backs upon themselves!<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Why what's the matter, my dear fellow, now?<br/>Do the troops mutiny?--decimate some regiments;<br/>Does money fail?--come to my mint--coin paper,<br/>Till gold be at a discount, and ashamed<br/>To show his bilious face, go purge himself,<br/>In emulation of her vestal whiteness.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Oh, would that this were all! The oracle!!<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Why it was I who spoke that oracle,<br/>And whether I was dead drunk or inspired,<br/>I cannot well remember; nor, in truth,<br/>The oracle itself!<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>The words went thus:--<br/>'Boeotia, choose reform or civil war!<br/>When through the streets, instead of hare with dogs,<br/>A Consort Queen shall hunt a King with Hogs,<br/>Riding on the Ionian Minotaur.'<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Now if the oracle had ne'er foretold<br/>This sad alternative, it must arrive,<br/>Or not, and so it must now that it has;<br/>And whether I was urged by grace divine<br/>Or Lesbian liquor to declare these words,<br/>Which must, as all words must, he false or true,<br/>It matters not: for the same Power made all,<br/>Oracle, wine, and me and you--or none--<br/>'Tis the same thing. If you knew as much<br/>Of oracles as I do--<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>You arch-priests<br/>Believe in nothing; if you were to dream<br/>Of a particular number in the Lottery,<br/>You would not buy the ticket?<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Yet our tickets<br/>Are seldom blanks. But what steps have you taken?<br/>For prophecies, when once they get abroad,<br/>Like liars who tell the truth to serve their ends,<br/>Or hypocrites who, from assuming virtue,<br/>Do the same actions that the virtuous do,<br/>Contrive their own fulfilment. This Iona--<br/>Well--you know what the chaste Pasiphae did,<br/>Wife to that most religious King of Crete,<br/>And still how popular the tale is here;<br/>And these dull Swine of Thebes boast their descent<br/>From the free Minotaur. You know they still<br/>Call themselves Bulls, though thus degenerate,<br/>And everything relating to a Bull<br/>Is popular and respectable in Thebes.<br/>Their arms are seven Bulls in a field gules;<br/>They think their strength consists in eating beef,--<br/>Now there were danger in the precedent<br/>If Queen Iona--<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>I have taken good care<br/>That shall not be. I struck the crust o' the earth<br/>With this enchanted rod, and Hell lay bare!<br/>And from a cavern full of ugly shapes<br/>I chose a LEECH, a GADFLY, and a RAT.<br/>The Gadfly was the same which Juno sent<br/>To agitate Io, and which Ezekiel mentions<br/>That the Lord whistled for out of the mountains<br/>Of utmost Aethiopia, to torment<br/>Mesopotamian Babylon. The beast<br/>Has a loud trumpet like the scarabee,<br/>His crooked tail is barbed with many stings,<br/>Each able to make a thousand wounds, and each<br/>Immedicable; from his convex eyes<br/>He sees fair things in many hideous shapes,<br/>And trumpets all his falsehood to the world.<br/>Like other beetles he is fed on dung--<br/>He has eleven feet with which he crawls,<br/>Trailing a blistering slime, and this foul beast<br/>Has tracked Iona from the Theban limits,<br/>From isle to isle, from city unto city,<br/>Urging her flight from the far Chersonese<br/>To fabulous Solyma, and the Aetnean Isle,<br/>Ortygia, Melite, and Calypso's Rock,<br/>And the swart tribes of Garamant and Fez,<br/>Aeolia and Elysium, and thy shores,<br/>Parthenope, which now, alas! are free!<br/>And through the fortunate Saturnian land,<br/>Into the darkness of the West.<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>But if<br/>This Gadfly should drive Iona hither?<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Gods! what an IF! but there is my gray RAT:<br/>So thin with want, he can crawl in and out<br/>Of any narrow chink and filthy hole,<br/>And he shall creep into her dressing-room,<br/>And--<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>My dear friend, where are your wits? as if<br/>She does not always toast a piece of cheese<br/>And bait the trap? and rats, when lean enough<br/>To crawl through SUCH chinks--<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>But my LEECH--a leech<br/>Fit to suck blood, with lubricous round rings,<br/>Capaciously expatiative, which make<br/>His little body like a red balloon,<br/>As full of blood as that of hydrogen,<br/>Sucked from men's hearts; insatiably he sucks<br/>And clings and pulls--a horse-leech, whose deep maw<br/>The plethoric King Swellfoot could not fill,<br/>And who, till full, will cling for ever.<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>This<br/>For Queen Jona would suffice, and less;<br/>But 'tis the Swinish multitude I fear,<br/>And in that fear I have--<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Done what?<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Disinherited<br/>My eldest son Chrysaor, because he<br/>Attended public meetings, and would always<br/>Stand prating there of commerce, public faith,<br/>Economy, and unadulterate coin,<br/>And other topics, ultra-radical;<br/>And have entailed my estate, called the Fool's Paradise,<br/>And funds in fairy-money, bonds, and bills,<br/>Upon my accomplished daughter Banknotina,<br/>And married her to the gallows. [1]<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>A good match!<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>A high connexion, Purganax. The bridegroom<br/>Is of a very ancient family,<br/>Of Hounslow Heath, Tyburn, and the New Drop,<br/>And has great influence in both Houses;--oh!<br/>He makes the fondest husband; nay, TOO fond,--<br/>New-married people should not kiss in public;<br/>But the poor souls love one another so!<br/>And then my little grandchildren, the gibbets,<br/>Promising children as you ever saw,--<br/>The young playing at hanging, the elder learning<br/>How to hold radicals. They are well taught too,<br/>For every gibbet says its catechism<br/>And reads a select chapter in the Bible<br/>Before it goes to play.<br/><br/>[A MOST TREMENDOUS HUMMING IS HEARD.]<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Ha! what do I hear?<br/><br/>[ENTER THE GADFLY.]<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Your Gadfly, as it seems, is tired of gadding.<br/><br/>GADFLY:<br/>Hum! hum! hum!<br/>From the lakes of the Alps, and the cold gray scalps<br/>Of the mountains, I come!<br/>Hum! hum! hum!<br/>From Morocco and Fez, and the high palaces<br/>Of golden Byzantium;<br/>From the temples divine of old Palestine,<br/>From Athens and Rome,<br/>With a ha! and a hum!<br/>I come! I come!<br/><br/>All inn-doors and windows<br/>Were open to me:<br/>I saw all that sin does,<br/>Which lamps hardly see<br/>That burn in the night by the curtained bed,--<br/>The impudent lamps! for they blushed not red,<br/>Dinging and singing,<br/>From slumber I rung her,<br/>Loud as the clank of an ironmonger;<br/>Hum! hum! hum!<br/><br/>Far, far, far!<br/>With the trump of my lips, and the sting at my hips,<br/>I drove her--afar!<br/>Far, far, far!<br/>From city to city, abandoned of pity,<br/>A ship without needle or star;--<br/>Homeless she passed, like a cloud on the blast,<br/>Seeking peace, finding war;--<br/>She is here in her car,<br/>From afar, and afar;--<br/>Hum! hum!<br/><br/>I have stung her and wrung her,<br/>The venom is working;--<br/>And if you had hung her<br/>With canting and quirking,<br/>She could not be deader than she will be soon;--<br/>I have driven her close to you, under the moon,<br/>Night and day, hum! hum! ha!<br/>I have hummed her and drummed her<br/>From place to place, till at last I have dumbed her,<br/>Hum! hum! hum!<br/><br/>[ENTER THE LEECH AND THE RAT.]<br/><br/>LEECH:<br/>I will suck<br/>Blood or muck!<br/>The disease of the state is a plethory,<br/>Who so fit to reduce it as I?<br/><br/>RAT:<br/>I'll slily seize and<br/>Let blood from her weasand,--<br/>Creeping through crevice, and chink, and cranny,<br/>With my snaky tail, and my sides so scranny.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Aroint ye! thou unprofitable worm!<br/>[TO THE LEECH.]<br/>And thou, dull beetle, get thee back to hell!<br/>[TO THE GADFLY.]<br/>To sting the ghosts of Babylonian kings,<br/>And the ox-headed Io--<br/><br/>SWINE (WITHIN):<br/>Ugh, ugh, ugh!<br/>Hail! Iona the divine,<br/>We will be no longer Swine,<br/>But Bulls with horns and dewlaps.<br/><br/>RAT:<br/>For,<br/>You know, my lord, the Minotaur--<br/><br/>PURGANAX (FIERCELY):<br/>Be silent! get to hell! or I will call<br/>The cat out of the kitchen. Well, Lord Mammon,<br/>This is a pretty business.<br/><br/>[EXIT THE RAT.]<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>I will go<br/>And spell some scheme to make it ugly then.--<br/><br/>[EXIT.]<br/><br/>[ENTER SWELLFOOT.]<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>She is returned! Taurina is in Thebes,<br/>When Swellfoot wishes that she were in hell!<br/>Oh, Hymen, clothed in yellow jealousy,<br/>And waving o'er the couch of wedded kings<br/>The torch of Discord with its fiery hair;<br/>This is thy work, thou patron saint of queens!<br/>Swellfoot is wived! though parted by the sea,<br/>The very name of wife had conjugal rights;<br/>Her cursed image ate, drank, slept with me,<br/>And in the arms of Adiposa oft 290<br/>Her memory has received a husband's--<br/>[A LOUD TUMULT, AND CRIES OF 'IONA FOR EVER --NO SWELLFOOT!']<br/>Hark!<br/>How the Swine cry Iona Taurina;<br/>I suffer the real presence; Purganax,<br/>Off with her head!<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>But I must first impanel<br/>A jury of the Pigs.<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>Pack them then.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Or fattening some few in two separate sties.<br/>And giving them clean straw, tying some bits<br/>Of ribbon round their legs--giving their Sows<br/>Some tawdry lace, and bits of lustre glass,<br/>And their young Boars white and red rags, and tails<br/>Of cows, and jay feathers, and sticking cauliflowers<br/>Between the ears of the old ones; and when<br/>They are persuaded, that by the inherent virtue<br/>Of these things, they are all imperial Pigs,<br/>Good Lord! they'd rip each other's bellies up,<br/>Not to say, help us in destroying her.<br/><br/>SWELLFOOT:<br/>This plan might be tried too;--where's General Laoctonos?<br/>[ENTER LAOCTONOS AND DAKRY.]<br/>It is my royal pleasure<br/>That you, Lord General, bring the head and body,<br/>If separate it would please me better, hither<br/>Of Queen Iona.<br/><br/>LAOCTONOS:<br/>That pleasure I well knew,<br/>And made a charge with those battalions bold,<br/>Called, from their dress and grin, the royal apes,<br/>Upon the Swine, who in a hollow square<br/>Enclosed her, and received the first attack<br/>Like so many rhinoceroses, and then<br/>Retreating in good order, with bare tusks<br/>And wrinkled snouts presented to the foe,<br/>Bore her in triumph to the public sty.<br/>What is still worse, some Sows upon the ground<br/>Have given the ape-guards apples, nuts, and gin,<br/>And they all whisk their tails aloft, and cry,<br/>'Long live Iona! down with Swellfoot!'<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Hark!<br/><br/>THE SWINE (WITHOUT):<br/>Long live Iona! down with Swellfoot!<br/><br/>DAKRY:<br/>I<br/>Went to the garret of the swineherd's tower,<br/>Which overlooks the sty, and made a long<br/>Harangue (all words) to the assembled Swine,<br/>Of delicacy mercy, judgement, law,<br/>Morals, and precedents, and purity,<br/>Adultery, destitution, and divorce,<br/>Piety, faith, and state necessity,<br/>And how I loved the Queen!--and then I wept<br/>With the pathos of my own eloquence,<br/>And every tear turned to a mill-stone, which<br/>Brained many a gaping Pig, and there was made<br/>A slough of blood and brains upon the place,<br/>Greased with the pounded bacon; round and round<br/>The mill-stones rolled, ploughing the pavement up,<br/>And hurling Sucking-Pigs into the air,<br/>With dust and stones.--<br/><br/>[ENTER MAMMON.]<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>I wonder that gray wizards<br/>Like you should be so beardless in their schemes;<br/>It had been but a point of policy<br/>To keep Iona and the Swine apart.<br/>Divide and rule! but ye have made a junction<br/>Between two parties who will govern you<br/>But for my art.--Behold this BAG! it is<br/>The poison BAG of that Green Spider huge,<br/>On which our spies skulked in ovation through<br/>The streets of Thebes, when they were paved with dead:<br/>A bane so much the deadlier fills it now<br/>As calumny is worse than death,--for here<br/>The Gadfly's venom, fifty times distilled,<br/>Is mingled with the vomit of the Leech,<br/>In due proportion, and black ratsbane, which<br/>That very Rat, who, like the Pontic tyrant,<br/>Nurtures himself on poison, dare not touch;--<br/>All is sealed up with the broad seal of Fraud,<br/>Who is the Devil's Lord High Chancellor,<br/>And over it the Primate of all Hell<br/>Murmured this pious baptism:--'Be thou called<br/>The GREEN BAG; and this power and grace be thine:<br/>That thy contents, on whomsoever poured,<br/>Turn innocence to guilt, and gentlest looks<br/>To savage, foul, and fierce deformity.<br/>Let all baptized by thy infernal dew<br/>Be called adulterer, drunkard, liar, wretch!<br/>No name left out which orthodoxy loves,<br/>Court Journal or legitimate Review!--<br/>Be they called tyrant, beast, fool, glutton, lover<br/>Of other wives and husbands than their own--<br/>The heaviest sin on this side of the Alps!<br/>Wither they to a ghastly caricature<br/>Of what was human!--let not man or beast<br/>Behold their face with unaverted eyes!<br/>Or hear their names with ears that tingle not<br/>With blood of indignation, rage, and shame!'--<br/>This is a perilous liquor;--good my Lords.--<br/>[SWELLFOOT APPROACHES TO TOUCH THE GREEN BAG.]<br/>Beware! for God's sake, beware!-if you should break<br/>The seal, and touch the fatal liquor--<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>There,<br/>Give it to me. I have been used to handle<br/>All sorts of poisons. His dread Majesty<br/>Only desires to see the colour of it.<br/><br/>MAMMON:<br/>Now, with a little common sense, my Lords,<br/>Only undoing all that has been done<br/>(Yet so as it may seem we but confirm it),<br/>Our victory is assured. We must entice<br/>Her Majesty from the sty, and make the Pigs<br/>Believe that the contents of the GREEN BAG<br/>Are the true test of guilt or innocence.<br/>And that, if she be guilty, 'twill transform her<br/>To manifest deformity like guilt.<br/>If innocent, she will become transfigured<br/>Into an angel, such as they say she is;<br/>And they will see her flying through the air,<br/>So bright that she will dim the noonday sun;<br/>Showering down blessings in the shape of comfits.<br/>This, trust a priest, is just the sort of thing<br/>Swine will believe. I'll wager you will see them<br/>Climbing upon the thatch of their low sties,<br/>With pieces of smoked glass, to watch her sail<br/>Among the clouds, and some will hold the flaps<br/>Of one another's ears between their teeth,<br/>To catch the coming hail of comfits in.<br/>You, Purganax, who have the gift o' the gab,<br/>Make them a solemn speech to this effect:<br/>I go to put in readiness the feast<br/>Kept to the honour of our goddess Famine,<br/>Where, for more glory, let the ceremony<br/>Take place of the uglification of the Queen.<br/><br/>DAKRY (TO SWELLFOOT):<br/>I, as the keeper of your sacred conscience,<br/>Humbly remind your Majesty that the care<br/>Of your high office, as Man-milliner<br/>To red Bellona, should not be deferred.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>All part, in happier plight to meet again.<br/><br/>[EXEUNT.]<br/><br/>END OF THE ACT 1.<br/><br/>ACT 2.<br/><br/>SCENE 1.2:<br/>THE PUBLIC STY.<br/>THE B0ARS IN FULL ASSEMBLY.<br/>ENTER PUEGANAX.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Grant me your patience, Gentlemen and Boars,<br/>Ye, by whose patience under public burthens<br/>The glorious constitution of these sties<br/>Subsists, and shall subsist. The Lean-Pig rates<br/>Grow with the growing populace of Swine,<br/>The taxes, that true source of Piggishness<br/>(How can I find a more appropriate term<br/>To include religion, morals, peace, and plenty,<br/>And all that fit Boeotia as a nation<br/>To teach the other nations how to live?),<br/>Increase with Piggishness itself; and still<br/>Does the revenue, that great spring of all<br/>The patronage, and pensions, and by-payments,<br/>Which free-born Pigs regard with jealous eyes,<br/>Diminish, till at length, by glorious steps,<br/>All the land's produce will be merged in taxes,<br/>And the revenue will amount to--nothing!<br/>The failure of a foreign market for<br/>Sausages, bristles, and blood-puddings,<br/>And such home manufactures, is but partial;<br/>And, that the population of the Pigs,<br/>Instead of hog-wash, has been fed on straw<br/>And water, is a fact which is--you know--<br/>That is--it is a state-necessity--<br/>Temporary, of course. Those impious Pigs,<br/>Who, by frequent squeaks, have dared impugn<br/>The settled Swellfoot system, or to make<br/>Irreverent mockery of the genuflexions<br/>Inculcated by the arch-priest, have been whipped<br/>Into a loyal and an orthodox whine.<br/>Things being in this happy state, the Queen<br/>Iona--<br/><br/>A LOUD CRY FROM THE PIGS:<br/>She is innocent! most innocent!<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>That is the very thing that I was saying,<br/>Gentlemen Swine; the Queen Iona being<br/>Most innocent, no doubt, returns to Thebes,<br/>And the lean Sows and Bears collect about her,<br/>Wishing to make her think that WE believe<br/>(I mean those more substantial Pigs, who swill<br/>Rich hog-wash, while the others mouth damp straw)<br/>That she is guilty; thus, the Lean-Pig faction<br/>Seeks to obtain that hog-wash, which has been<br/>Your immemorial right, and which I will<br/>Maintain you in to the last drop of--<br/><br/>A BOAR (INTERRUPTING HIM):<br/>What<br/>Does any one accuse her of?<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Why, no one<br/>Makes ANY positive accusation;--but<br/>There were hints dropped, and so the privy wizards<br/>Conceived that it became them to advise<br/>His Majesty to investigate their truth;--<br/>Not for his own sake; he could be content<br/>To let his wife play any pranks she pleased,<br/>If, by that sufferance, HE could please the Pigs;<br/>But then he fears the morals of the Swine,<br/>The Sows especially, and what effect<br/>It might produce upon the purity and<br/>Religion of the rising generation<br/>Of Sucking-Pigs, if it could be suspected<br/>That Queen Iona--<br/><br/>[A PAUSE.]<br/><br/>FIRST BOAR:<br/>Well, go on; we long<br/>To hear what she can possibly have done.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Why, it is hinted, that a certain Bull--<br/>Thus much is KNOWN:--the milk-white Bulls that feed<br/>Beside Clitumnus and the crystal lakes<br/>Of the Cisalpine mountains, in fresh dews<br/>Of lotus-grass and blossoming asphodel<br/>Sleeking their silken hair, and with sweet breath<br/>Loading the morning winds until they faint<br/>With living fragrance, are so beautiful!--<br/>Well, _I_ say nothing;--but Europa rode<br/>On such a one from Asia into Crete,<br/>And the enamoured sea grew calm beneath<br/>His gliding beauty. And Pasiphae,<br/>Iona's grandmother,--but SHE is innocent!<br/>And that both you and I, and all assert.<br/><br/>FIRST BOAR:<br/>Most innocent!<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Behold this BAG; a bag--<br/><br/>SECOND BOAR:<br/>Oh! no GREEN BAGS!! Jealousy's eyes are green,<br/>Scorpions are green, and water-snakes, and efts,<br/>And verdigris, and--<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Honourable Swine,<br/>In Piggish souls can prepossessions reign?<br/>Allow me to remind you, grass is green--<br/>All flesh is grass;--no bacon but is flesh--<br/>Ye are but bacon. This divining BAG<br/>(Which is not green, but only bacon colour)<br/>Is filled with liquor, which if sprinkled o'er<br/>A woman guilty of--we all know what--<br/>Makes her so hideous, till she finds one blind<br/>She never can commit the like again.<br/>If innocent, she will turn into an angel,<br/>And rain down blessings in the shape of comfits<br/>As she flies up to heaven. Now, my proposal<br/>Is to convert her sacred Majesty<br/>Into an angel (as I am sure we shall do),<br/>By pouring on her head this mystic water.<br/>[SHOWING THE BAG.]<br/>I know that she is innocent; I wish<br/>Only to prove her so to all the world.<br/><br/>FIRST BOAR:<br/>Excellent, just, and noble Purganax.<br/><br/>SECOND BOAR:<br/>How glorious it will be to see her Majesty<br/>Flying above our heads, her petticoats<br/>Streaming like--like--like--<br/><br/>THIRD BOAR:<br/>Anything.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Oh no!<br/>But like a standard of an admiral's ship,<br/>Or like the banner of a conquering host,<br/>Or like a cloud dyed in the dying day,<br/>Unravelled on the blast from a white mountain;<br/>Or like a meteor, or a war-steed's mane,<br/>Or waterfall from a dizzy precipice<br/>Scattered upon the wind.<br/><br/>FIRST BOAR:<br/>Or a cow's tail.<br/><br/>SECOND BOAR:<br/>Or ANYTHING, as the learned Boar observed.<br/><br/>PURGANAX:<br/>Gentlemen Boars, I move a resolution,<br/>That her most sacred Majesty should be<br/>Invited to attend the feast of Famine,<br/>And to receive upon her chaste white body<br/>Dews of Apotheosis from this BAG.<br/><br/>[A GREAT CONFUSION IS HEARD OF THE PIGS OUT OF DOORS, WHICH<br/>COMMUNICATES ITSELF TO THOSE WITHIN.
