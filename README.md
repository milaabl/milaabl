# üíÆ The Song of Hiawatha: X by *Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*

<p>
    X. Hiawatha's Wooing<br/><br/>"As unto the bow the cord is,<br/>So unto the man is woman,<br/>Though she bends him, she obeys him,<br/>Though she draws him, yet she follows,<br/>Useless each without the other!"<br/><br/>Thus the youthful Hiawatha<br/>Said within himself and pondered,<br/>Much perplexed by various feelings,<br/>Listless, longing, hoping, fearing,<br/>Dreaming still of Minnehaha,<br/>Of the lovely Laughing Water,<br/>In the land of the Dacotahs.<br/><br/>"Wed a maiden of your people,"<br/>Warning said the old Nokomis;<br/>"Go not eastward, go not westward,<br/>For a stranger, whom we know not!<br/>Like a fire upon the hearth-stone<br/>Is a neighbor's homely daughter,<br/>Like the starlight or the moonlight<br/>Is the handsomest of strangers!"<br/><br/>Thus dissuading spake Nokomis,<br/>And my Hiawatha answered<br/>Only this: "Dear old Nokomis,<br/>Very pleasant is the firelight,<br/>But I like the starlight better,<br/>Better do I like the moonlight!"<br/><br/>Gravely then said old Nokomis:<br/>"Bring not here an idle maiden,<br/>Bring not here a useless woman,<br/>Hands unskilful, feet unwilling;<br/>Bring a wife with nimble fingers,<br/>Heart and hand that move together,<br/>Feet that run on willing errands!"<br/><br/>Smiling answered Hiawatha:<br/>"In the land of the Dacotahs<br/>Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter,<br/>Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br/>Handsomest of all the women.<br/>I will bring her to your wigwam,<br/>She shall run upon your errands,<br/>Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight,<br/>Be the sunlight of my people!"<br/><br/>Still dissuading said Nokomis:<br/>"Bring not to my lodge a stranger<br/>From the land of the Dacotahs!<br/>Very fierce are the Dacotahs,<br/>Often is there war between us,<br/>There are feuds yet unforgotten,<br/>Wounds that ache and still may open!<br/><br/>Laughing answered Hiawatha:<br/>"For that reason, if no other,<br/>Would I wed the fair Dacotah,<br/>That our tribes might be united,<br/>That old feuds might be forgotten,<br/>And old wounds be healed forever!"<br/><br/>Thus departed Hiawatha<br/>To the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>To the land of handsome women;<br/>Striding over moor and meadow,<br/>Through interminable forests,<br/>Through uninterrupted silence.<br/><br/>With his moccasins of magic,<br/>At each stride a mile he measured;<br/>Yet the way seemed long before him,<br/>And his heart outran his footsteps;<br/>And he journeyed without resting,<br/>Till he heard the cataract's laughter,<br/>Heard the Falls of Minnehaha<br/>Calling to him through the silence.<br/>"Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured,<br/>"Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"<br/><br/>On the outskirts of the forests,<br/>'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,<br/>Herds of fallow deer were feeding,<br/>But they saw not Hiawatha;<br/>To his bow be whispered, "Fail not!"<br/>To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not!"<br/>Sent it singing on its errand,<br/>To the red heart of the roebuck;<br/>Threw the deer across his shoulder,<br/>And sped forward without pausing.<br/><br/>At the doorway of his wigwam<br/>Sat his ancient Arrow-maker,<br/>In the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>Making arrow-heads of jasper,<br/>Arrow-heads of chalcedony.<br/>At his side, in all her beauty,<br/>Sat the lovely Minnehaha,<br/>Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,<br/>Plaiting mats of flags and rushes;<br/>Of the past the old man's thoughts were,<br/>And the maiden's of the future.<br/><br/>He was thinking, as he sat there,<br/>Of the days when with such arrows<br/>He had struck the deer and bison,<br/>On the Muskoday, the meadow;<br/>Shot the wild goose, flying southward,<br/>On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;<br/>Thinking of the great war-parties,<br/>How they came to buy his arrows,<br/>Could not fight without his arrows.<br/>Ah, no more such noble warriors<br/>Could be found on earth as they were!<br/>Now the men were all like women,<br/>Only used their tongues for weapons!<br/><br/>She was thinking of a hunter,<br/>From another tribe and country,<br/>Young and tall and very handsome,<br/>Who one morning, in the Spring-time,<br/>Came to buy her father's arrows,<br/>Lingered long about the doorway,<br/>Sat and rested in the wigwam,<br/>Looking back as he departed.<br/>She had heard her father praise him,<br/>Praise his courage and his wisdom;<br/>Would he come again for arrows<br/>To the Falls of Minnehaha?<br/>On the mat her hands lay idle,<br/>And her eyes were very dreamy.<br/><br/>Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,<br/>Heard a rustling in the branches,<br/>And with glowing cheek and forehead,<br/>With the deer upon his shoulders,<br/>Suddenly from out the woodlands<br/>Hiawatha stood before them.<br/><br/>Straight the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>Looked up gravely from his labor,<br/>Laid aside the unfinished arrow,<br/>Bade him enter at the doorway,<br/>Saying, as he rose to meet him,<br/>"Hiawatha, you are welcome!"<br/><br/>At the feet of Laughing Water<br/>Hiawatha laid his burden,<br/>Threw the red deer from his shoulders;<br/>And the maiden looked up at him,<br/>Looked up from her mat of rushes,<br/>Said with gentle look and accent,<br/>"You are welcome, Hiawatha!"<br/><br/>Very spacious was the wigwam,<br/>Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened,<br/>With the Gods of the Dacotahs<br/>Drawn and painted on its curtains,<br/>And so tall the doorway, hardly<br/>Hiawatha stooped to enter,<br/>Hardly touched his eagle-feathers<br/>As he entered at the doorway.<br/><br/>Then uprose the Laughing Water,<br/>From the ground fair Minnehaha,<br/>Laid aside her mat unfinished,<br/>Brought forth food and set before them,<br/>Water brought them from the brooklet,<br/>Gave them food in earthen vessels,<br/>Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,<br/>Listened while the guest was speaking,<br/>Listened while her father answered,<br/>But not once her lips she opened,<br/>Not a single word she uttered.<br/><br/>Yes, as in a dream she listened<br/>To the words of Hiawatha,<br/>As he talked of old Nokomis,<br/>Who had nursed him in his childhood,<br/>As he told of his companions,<br/>Chibiabos, the musician,<br/>And the very strong man, Kwasind,<br/>And of happiness and plenty<br/>In the land of the Ojibways,<br/>In the pleasant land and peaceful.<br/><br/>"After many years of warfare,<br/>Many years of strife and bloodshed,<br/>There is peace between the Ojibways<br/>And the tribe of the Dacotahs."<br/>Thus continued Hiawatha,<br/>And then added, speaking slowly,<br/>'That this peace may last forever,<br/>And our hands be clasped more closely,<br/>And our hearts be more united,<br/>Give me as my wife this maiden,<br/>Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br/>Loveliest of Dacotah women!<br/><br/>And the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>Paused a moment ere he answered,<br/>Smoked a little while in silence,<br/>Looked at Hiawatha proudly,<br/>Fondly looked at Laughing Water,<br/>And made answer very gravely:<br/>"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;<br/>Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"<br/><br/>And the lovely Laughing Water<br/>Seemed more lovely as she stood there,<br/>Neither willing nor reluctant,<br/>As she went to Hiawatha,<br/>Softly took the seat beside him,<br/>While she said, and blushed to say it,<br/>"I will follow you, my husband!"<br/><br/>This was Hiawatha's wooing!<br/>Thus it was he won the daughter<br/>Of the ancient Arrow-maker,<br/>In the land of the Dacotahs!<br/><br/>From the wigwam he departed,<br/>Leading with him Laughing Water;<br/>Hand in hand they went together,<br/>Through the woodland and the meadow,<br/>Left the old man standing lonely<br/>At the doorway of his wigwam,<br/>Heard the Falls of Minnehaha<br/>Calling to them from the distance,<br/>Crying to them from afar off,<br/>"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"<br/><br/>And the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>Turned again unto his labor,<br/>Sat down by his sunny doorway,<br/>Murmuring to himself, and saying:<br/>"Thus it is our daughters leave us,<br/>Those we love, and those who love us!<br/>Just when they have learned to help us,<br/>When we are old and lean upon them,<br/>Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,<br/>With his flute of reeds, a stranger<br/>Wanders piping through the village,<br/>Beckons to the fairest maiden,<br/>And she follows where he leads her,<br/>Leaving all things for the stranger!"<br/><br/>Pleasant was the journey homeward,<br/>Through interminable forests,<br/>Over meadow, over mountain,<br/>Over river, hill, and hollow.<br/>Short it seemed to Hiawatha,<br/>Though they journeyed very slowly,<br/>Though his pace he checked and slackened<br/>To the steps of Laughing Water.<br/><br/>Over wide and rushing rivers<br/>In his arms he bore the maiden;<br/>Light he thought her as a feather,<br/>As the plume upon his head-gear;<br/>Cleared the tangled pathway for her,<br/>Bent aside the swaying branches,<br/>Made at night a lodge of branches,<br/>And a bed with boughs of hemlock,<br/>And a fire before the doorway<br/>With the dry cones of the pine-tree.<br/><br/>All the travelling winds went with them,<br/>O'er the meadows, through the forest;<br/>All the stars of night looked at them,<br/>Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber;<br/>From his ambush in the oak-tree<br/>Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>Watched with eager eyes the lovers;<br/>And the rabbit, the Wabasso,<br/>Scampered from the path before them,<br/>Peering, peeping from his burrow,<br/>Sat erect upon his haunches,<br/>Watched with curious eyes the lovers.<br/><br/>Pleasant was the journey homeward!<br/>All the birds sang loud and sweetly<br/>Songs of happiness and heart's-ease;<br/>Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>"Happy are you, Hiawatha,<br/>Having such a wife to love you!"<br/>Sang the robin, the Opechee,<br/>"Happy are you, Laughing Water,<br/>Having such a noble husband!"<br/><br/>From the sky the sun benignant<br/>Looked upon them through the branches,<br/>Saying to them, "O my children,<br/>Love is sunshine, hate is shadow,<br/>Life is checkered shade and sunshine,<br/>Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"<br/><br/>From the sky the moon looked at them,<br/>Filled the lodge with mystic splendors,<br/>Whispered to them, "O my children,<br/>Day is restless, night is quiet,<br/>Man imperious, woman feeble;<br/>Half is mine, although I follow;<br/>Rule by patience, Laughing Water!"<br/><br/>Thus it was they journeyed homeward;<br/>Thus it was that Hiawatha<br/>To the lodge of old Nokomis<br/>Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,<br/>Brought the sunshine of his people,<br/>Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br/>Handsomest of all the women<br/>In the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>In the land of handsome women.
