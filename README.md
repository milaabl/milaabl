# üíÆ Spring in Town by *William Cullen Bryant*

<p>
    The country ever has a lagging Spring,<br/>Waiting for May to call its violets forth,<br/>And June its roses--showers and sunshine bring,<br/>Slowly, the deepening verdure o'er the earth;<br/>To put their foliage out, the woods are slack,<br/>And one by one the singing-birds come back.<br/><br/>Within the city's bounds the time of flowers<br/>Comes earlier. Let a mild and sunny day,<br/>Such as full often, for a few bright hours,<br/>Breathes through the sky of March the airs of May,<br/>Shine on our roofs and chase the wintry gloom--<br/>And lo! our borders glow with sudden bloom.<br/><br/>For the wide sidewalks of Broadway are then<br/>Gorgeous as are a rivulet's banks in June,<br/>That overhung with blossoms, through its glen,<br/>Slides soft away beneath the sunny noon,<br/>And they who search the untrodden wood for flowers<br/>Meet in its depths no lovelier ones than ours.<br/><br/>For here are eyes that shame the violet,<br/>Or the dark drop that on the pansy lies,<br/>And foreheads, white, as when in clusters set,<br/>The anemonies by forest fountains rise;<br/><br/>And the spring-beauty boasts no tenderer streak<br/>Than the soft red on many a youthful cheek.<br/><br/>And thick about those lovely temples lie<br/>Locks that the lucky Vignardonne has curled,<br/>Thrice happy man! whose trade it is to buy,<br/>And bake, and braid those love-knots of the world;<br/>Who curls of every glossy colour keepest,<br/>And sellest, it is said, the blackest cheapest.<br/><br/>And well thou may'st--for Italy's brown maids<br/>Send the dark locks with which their brows are dressed,<br/>And Gascon lasses, from their jetty braids,<br/>Crop half, to buy a riband for the rest;<br/>But the fresh Norman girls their tresses spare,<br/>And the Dutch damsel keeps her flaxen hair.<br/><br/>Then, henceforth, let no maid nor matron grieve,<br/>To see her locks of an unlovely hue,<br/>Frouzy or thin, for liberal art shall give<br/>Such piles of curls as nature never knew.<br/>Eve, with her veil of tresses, at the sight<br/>Had blushed, outdone, and owned herself a fright.<br/><br/>Soft voices and light laughter wake the street,<br/>Like notes of woodbirds, and where'er the eye<br/>Threads the long way, plumes wave, and twinkling feet<br/>Fall light, as hastes that crowd of beauty by.<br/>The ostrich, hurrying o'er the desert space,<br/>Scarce bore those tossing plumes with fleeter pace.<br/><br/>No swimming Juno gait, of languor born,<br/>Is theirs, but a light step of freest grace,<br/>Light as Camilla's o'er the unbent corn,<br/>A step that speaks the spirit of the place,<br/>Since Quiet, meek old dame, was driven away<br/>To Sing Sing and the shores of Tappan bay.<br/><br/>Ye that dash by in chariots! who will care<br/>For steeds or footmen now? ye cannot show<br/>Fair face, and dazzling dress, and graceful air,<br/>And last edition of the shape! Ah no,<br/>These sights are for the earth and open sky,<br/>And your loud wheels unheeded rattle by.
</p>
