# üíÆ Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice; an Historical Tragedy, in Five Acts by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
                   "_Dux_ inquieti turbidus Adria."<br/>                           Horace,<br/><br/>"The young man's wrath is like  straw on fire,<br/>_But like red hot steel is the old man's ire._"<br/><br/>"Young men soon give and soon forget affronts,<br/>Old age is slow at both."<br/><br/>                   Scene Venice--in the year 1355.<br/><br/>ACT I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_An Antechamber in the Ducal Palace_.<br/><br/>            PIETRO _speaks, in entering, to_ BATTISTA.<br/><br/>_Pie_. Is not the messenger returned?<br/><br/>_Bat_.                                   Not yet;<br/>I have sent frequently, as you commanded,<br/>But still the Signory is deep in council,<br/>And long debate on Steno's accusation.<br/><br/>_Pie_. Too long--at least so thinks the Doge.<br/><br/>_Bat_.                                       How bears he<br/>These moments of suspense?<br/><br/>_Pie_.                    With struggling patience.<br/>Placed at the Ducal table, covered o'er<br/>With all the apparel of the state--petitions,<br/>Despatches, judgments, acts, reprieves, reports,--<br/>He sits as rapt in duty; but whene'er<br/>He hears the jarring of a distant door,<br/>Or aught that intimates a coming step,<br/>Or murmur of a voice, his quick eye wanders,<br/>And he will start up from his chair, then pause,<br/>And seat himself again, and fix his gaze<br/>Upon some edict; but I have observed<br/>For the last hour he has not turned a leaf.<br/><br/>_Bat_. 'Tis said he is much moved,--and doubtless 'twas<br/>Foul scorn in Steno to offend so grossly.<br/><br/>_Pie_. Aye, if a poor man: Steno's a patrician,<br/>Young, galliard, gay, and haughty.<br/><br/>_Bat_.                                Then you think<br/>He will not be judged hardly?<br/><br/>_Pie_.                       'Twere enough<br/>He be judged justly; but 'tis not for us<br/>To anticipate the sentence of the Forty.<br/><br/>_Bat_. And here it comes.--What news, Vincenzo?<br/><br/>                            _Enter_ VINCENZO.<br/><br/>_Vin_.                                           'Tis<br/>Decided; but as yet his doom's unknown:<br/>I saw the President in act to seal<br/>The parchment which will bear the Forty's judgment<br/>Unto the Doge, and hasten to inform him.<br/>[_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--The Ducal Chamber.<br/><br/> MARINO FALIERO, _Doge; and his Nephew_, BERTUCCIO FALIERO.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ It cannot be but they will do you justice.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Aye, such as the Avogadori did,<br/>Who sent up my appeal unto the Forty<br/>To try him by his peers, his own tribunal.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ His peers will scarce protect him; such an act<br/>Would bring contempt on all authority.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Know you not Venice? Know you not the Forty?<br/>But we shall see anon.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ (_addressing_ VINCENZO, _then entering_.)<br/>                       How now--what tidings?<br/><br/>_Vin_. I am charged to tell his Highness that the court<br/>Has passed its resolution, and that, soon<br/>As the due forms of judgment are gone through,<br/>The sentence will be sent up to the Doge;<br/>In the mean time the Forty doth salute<br/>The Prince of the Republic, and entreat<br/>His acceptation of their duty.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                       Yes--<br/>They are wond'rous dutiful, and ever humble.<br/>Sentence is passed, you say?<br/><br/>_Vin_.                      It is, your Highness:<br/>The President was sealing it, when I<br/>Was called in, that no moment might be lost<br/>In forwarding the intimation due<br/>Not only to the Chief of the Republic,<br/>But the complainant, both in one united.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Are you aware, from aught you have perceived,<br/>Of their decision?<br/><br/>_Vin_.            No, my Lord; you know<br/>The secret custom of the courts in Venice.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ True; but there still is something given to guess,<br/>Which a shrewd gleaner and quick eye would catch at;<br/>A whisper, or a murmur, or an air<br/>More or less solemn spread o'er the tribunal.<br/>The Forty are but men--most worthy men,<br/>And wise, and just, and cautious--this I grant--<br/>And secret as the grave to which they doom<br/>The guilty: but with all this, in their aspects--<br/>At least in some, the juniors of the number--<br/>A searching eye, an eye like yours, Vincenzo,<br/>Would read the sentence ere it was pronounced.<br/><br/>_Vin_. My Lord, I came away upon the moment,<br/>And had no leisure to take note of that<br/>Which passed among the judges, even in seeming;<br/>My station near the accused too, Michel Steno,<br/>Made me--<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_abruptly_). And how looked _he_? deliver that.<br/><br/>_Vin_. Calm, but not overcast, he stood resigned<br/>To the decree, whate'er it were;--but lo!<br/>It comes, for the perusal of his Highness.<br/><br/>              _Enter the_ SECRETARY _of the Forty_.<br/><br/>_Sec_. The high tribunal of the Forty sends<br/>Health and respect to the Doge Faliero,<br/>Chief magistrate of Venice, and requests<br/>His Highness to peruse and to approve<br/>The sentence passed on Michel Steno, born<br/>Patrician, and arraigned upon the charge<br/>Contained, together with its penalty,<br/>Within the rescript which I now present.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Retire, and wait without.<br/><br/>                                           Take thou this paper:<br/>The misty letters vanish from my eyes;<br/>I cannot fix them.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._          Patience, my dear Uncle:<br/>Why do you tremble thus?--nay, doubt not, all<br/>Will be as could be wished.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                    Say on.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ (_reading_).           "Decreed<br/>In council, without one dissenting voice,<br/>That Michel Steno, by his own confession,<br/>Guilty on the last night of Carnival<br/>Of having graven on the ducal throne<br/>The following words--"<br/><br/>_Doge_.                Would'st thou repeat them?<br/>Would'st _thou_ repeat them--_thou_, a Faliero,<br/>Harp on the deep dishonour of our house,<br/>Dishonoured in its Chief--that Chief the Prince<br/>Of Venice, first of cities?--To the sentence.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Forgive me, my good Lord; I will obey--<br/>(_Reads_) "That Michel Steno be detained a month<br/>In close arrest."<br/><br/>_Doge_.             Proceed.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                  My Lord, 'tis finished.<br/><br/>_Doge_. How say you?--finished! Do I dream?--'tis false--<br/>Give me the paper--(_snatches the paper and reads_)--<br/>                  "'Tis decreed in council<br/>That Michel Steno"--Nephew, thine arm!<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                          Nay,<br/>Cheer up, be calm; this transport is uncalled for--<br/>Let me seek some assistance.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                     Stop, sir--Stir not--<br/>'Tis past.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._   I cannot but agree with you<br/>The sentence is too slight for the offence;<br/>It is not honourable in the Forty<br/>To affix so slight a penalty to that<br/>Which was a foul affront to you, and even<br/>To them, as being your subjects; but 'tis not<br/>Yet without remedy: you can appeal<br/>To them once more, or to the Avogadori,<br/>Who, seeing that true justice is withheld,<br/>Will now take up the cause they once declined,<br/>And do you right upon the bold delinquent.<br/>Think you not thus, good Uncle? why do you stand<br/>So fixed? You heed me not:--I pray you, hear me!<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_dashing down the ducal bonnet, and offering to<br/>trample upon it, exclaims, as he is withheld by his nephew_).<br/>Oh! that the Saracen were in St. Mark's!<br/>Thus would I do him homage.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                  For the sake<br/>Of Heaven and all its saints, my Lord--<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                Away!<br/>Oh, that the Genoese were in the port!<br/>Oh, that the Huns whom I o'erthrew at Zara<br/>Were ranged around the palace!<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                      'Tis not well<br/>In Venice' Duke to say so.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   Venice' Duke!<br/>Who now is Duke in Venice? let me see him,<br/>That he may do me right.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._               If you forget<br/>Your office, and its dignity and duty.<br/>Remember that of man, and curb this passion.<br/>The Duke of Venice----<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_interrupting him_). There is no such thing--<br/>It is a word--nay, worse--a worthless by-word:<br/>The most despised, wronged, outraged, helpless wretch,<br/>Who begs his bread, if 'tis refused by one,<br/>May win it from another kinder heart;<br/>But he, who is denied his right by those<br/>Whose place it is to do no wrong, is poorer<br/>Than the rejected beggar--he's a slave--<br/>And that am I--and thou--and all our house,<br/>Even from this hour; the meanest artisan<br/>Will point the finger, and the haughty noble<br/>May spit upon us:--where is our redress?<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ The law, my Prince--<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_interrupting him_). You see what it has done;<br/>I asked no remedy but from the law--<br/>I sought no vengeance but redress by law--<br/>I called no judges but those named by law--<br/>As Sovereign, I appealed unto my subjects,<br/>The very subjects who had made me Sovereign,<br/>And gave me thus a double right to be so.<br/>The rights of place and choice, of birth and service,<br/>Honours and years, these scars, these hoary hairs,<br/>The travel--toil--the perils--the fatigues--<br/>The blood and sweat of almost eighty years,<br/>Were weighed i' the balance, 'gainst the foulest stain,<br/>The grossest insult, most contemptuous crime<br/>Of a rank, rash patrician--and found wanting!<br/>And this is to be borne!<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                I say not that:--<br/>In case your fresh appeal should be rejected,<br/>We will find other means to make all even.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Appeal again! art thou my brother's son?<br/>A scion of the house of Faliero?<br/>The nephew of a Doge? and of that blood<br/>Which hath already given three dukes to Venice?<br/>But thou say'st well--we must be humble now.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ My princely Uncle! you are too much moved;--<br/>I grant it was a gross offence, and grossly<br/>Left without fitting punishment: but still<br/>This fury doth exceed the provocation,<br/>Or any provocation: if we are wronged,<br/>We will ask justice; if it be denied,<br/>We'll take it; but may do all this in calmness--<br/>Deep Vengeance is the daughter of deep Silence.<br/>I have yet scarce a third part of your years,<br/>I love our house, I honour you, its Chief,<br/>The guardian of my youth, and its instructor--<br/>But though I understand your grief, and enter<br/>In part of your disdain, it doth appal me<br/>To see your anger, like our Adrian waves,<br/>O'ersweep all bounds, and foam itself to air.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I tell thee--_must_ I tell thee--what thy father<br/>Would have required no words to comprehend?<br/>Hast thou no feeling save the external sense<br/>Of torture from the touch? hast thou no soul--<br/>No pride--no passion--no deep sense of honour?<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ 'Tis the first time that honour has been doubted,<br/>And were the last, from any other sceptic.<br/><br/>_Doge_. You know the full offence of this born villain,<br/>This creeping, coward, rank, acquitted felon,<br/>Who threw his sting into a poisonous libel,<br/>And on the honour of--Oh God! my wife,<br/>The nearest, dearest part of all men's honour,<br/>Left a base slur to pass from mouth to mouth<br/>Of loose mechanics, with all coarse foul comments,<br/>And villainous jests, and blasphemies obscene;<br/>While sneering nobles, in more polished guise,<br/>Whispered the tale, and smiled upon the lie<br/>Which made me look like them--a courteous wittol,<br/>Patient--aye--proud, it may be, of dishonour.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ But still it was a lie--you knew it false,<br/>And so did all men.<br/><br/>_Doge_.             Nephew, the high Roman<br/>Said, "C√¶sar's wife must not even be suspected,"<br/>And put her from him.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._             True--but in those days----<br/><br/>_Doge_. What is it that a Roman would not suffer,<br/>That a Venetian Prince must bear? old Dandolo<br/>Refused the diadem of all the C√¶sars,<br/>And wore the ducal cap _I_ trample on--<br/>Because 'tis now degraded.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                  'Tis even so.<br/><br/>_Doge_. It is--it is;--I did not visit on<br/>The innocent creature thus most vilely slandered<br/>Because she took an old man for her lord,<br/>For that he had been long her father's friend<br/>And patron of her house, as if there were<br/>No love in woman's heart but lust of youth<br/>And beardless faces;--I did not for this<br/>Visit the villain's infamy on her,<br/>But craved my country's justice on his head,<br/>The justice due unto the humblest being<br/>Who hath a wife whose faith is sweet to him,<br/>Who hath a home whose hearth is dear to him--<br/>Who hath a name whose honour's all to him,<br/>When these are tainted by the accursing breath<br/>Of Calumny and Scorn.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._             And what redress<br/>Did you expect as his fit punishment?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Death! Was I not the Sovereign of the state--<br/>Insulted on his very throne, and made<br/>A mockery to the men who should obey me?<br/>Was I not injured as a husband? scorned<br/>As man? reviled, degraded, as a Prince?<br/>Was not offence like his a complication<br/>Of insult and of treason?--and he lives!<br/>Had he instead of on the Doge's throne<br/>Stamped the same brand upon a peasant's stool,<br/>His blood had gilt the threshold; for the carle<br/>Had stabbed him on the instant.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                      Do not doubt it,<br/>He shall not live till sunset--leave to me<br/>The means, and calm yourself.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                       Hold, nephew: this<br/>Would have sufficed but yesterday; at present<br/>I have no further wrath against this man.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ What mean you? is not the offence redoubled<br/>By this most rank--I will not say--acquittal;<br/>For it is worse, being full acknowledgment<br/>Of the offence, and leaving it unpunished?<br/><br/>_Doge_. It is _redoubled_, but not now by him:<br/>The Forty hath decreed a month's arrest--<br/>We must obey the Forty.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._               Obey _them_!<br/>Who have forgot their duty to the Sovereign?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Why, yes;--boy, you perceive it then at last;<br/>Whether as fellow citizen who sues<br/>For justice, or as Sovereign who commands it,<br/>They have defrauded me of both my rights<br/>(For here the Sovereign is a citizen);<br/>But, notwithstanding, harm not thou a hair<br/>Of Steno's head--he shall not wear it long.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Not twelve hours longer, had you left to me<br/>The mode and means; if you had calmly heard me,<br/>I never meant this miscreant should escape,<br/>But wished you to suppress such gusts of passion,<br/>That we more surely might devise together<br/>His taking off.<br/><br/>_Doge_.         No, nephew, he must live;<br/>At least, just now--a life so vile as his<br/>Were nothing at this hour; in th' olden time<br/>Some sacrifices asked a single victim,<br/>Great expiations had a hecatomb.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Your wishes are my law: and yet I fain<br/>Would prove to you how near unto my heart<br/>The honour of our house must ever be.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Fear not; you shall have time and place of proof:<br/>But be not thou too rash, as I have been.<br/>I am ashamed of my own anger now;<br/>I pray you, pardon me.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._              Why, that's my uncle!<br/>The leader, and the statesman, and the chief<br/>Of commonwealths, and sovereign of himself!<br/>I wondered to perceive you so forget<br/>All prudence in your fury at these years,<br/>Although the cause--<br/><br/>_Doge_.              Aye--think upon the cause--<br/>Forget it not:--When you lie down to rest,<br/>Let it be black among your dreams; and when<br/>The morn returns, so let it stand between<br/>The Sun and you, as an ill-omened cloud<br/>Upon a summer-day of festival:<br/>So will it stand to me;--but speak not, stir not,--<br/>Leave all to me; we shall have much to do,<br/>And you shall have a part.--But now retire,<br/>'Tis fit I were alone.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ (_taking up and placing the ducal bonnet on the table_).<br/>                       Ere I depart,<br/>I pray you to resume what you have spurned,<br/>Till you can change it--haply, for a crown!<br/>And now I take my leave, imploring you<br/>In all things to rely upon my duty,<br/>As doth become your near and faithful kinsman,<br/>And not less loyal citizen and subject.<br/>                                              [Exit BERTUCCIO FALIERO.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_solus_). Adieu, my worthy nephew.--Hollow bauble!<br/>                                           [_Taking up the ducal cap_.<br/>Beset with all the thorns that line a crown,<br/>Without investing the insulted brow<br/>With the all-swaying majesty of Kings;<br/>Thou idle, gilded, and degraded toy,<br/>Let me resume thee as I would a vizor.                  [_Puts it on_.<br/>How my brain aches beneath thee! and my temples<br/>Throb feverish under thy dishonest weight.<br/>Could I not turn thee to a diadem?<br/>Could I not shatter the Briarean sceptre<br/>Which in this hundred-handed Senate rules,<br/>Making the people nothing, and the Prince<br/>A pageant? In my life I have achieved<br/>Tasks not less difficult--achieved for them,<br/>Who thus repay me! Can I not requite them?<br/>Oh for one year! Oh! but for even a day<br/>Of my full youth, while yet my body served<br/>My soul as serves the generous steed his lord,<br/>I would have dashed amongst them, asking few<br/>In aid to overthrow these swoln patricians;<br/>But now I must look round for other hands<br/>To serve this hoary head; but it shall plan<br/>In such a sort as will not leave the task<br/>Herculean, though as yet 'tis but a chaos<br/>Of darkly brooding thoughts: my fancy is<br/>In her first work, more nearly to the light<br/>Holding the sleeping images of things<br/>For the selection of the pausing judgment.--<br/>The troops are few in----<br/><br/>                        _Enter_ VINCENZO.<br/><br/>_Vin_.

I'm unwell--<br/>I can see no one, not even a patrician--<br/>Let him refer his business to the Council.<br/><br/>_Vin_. My Lord, I will deliver your reply;<br/>It cannot much import--he's a plebeian,<br/>The master of a galley, I believe.<br/><br/>_Doge_. How! did you say the patron of a galley?<br/>That is--I mean--a servant of the state:<br/>Admit him, he may be on public service.<br/>                                                     [_Exit_ VINCENZO.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_solus_). This patron may be sounded; I will try him.<br/>I know the people to be discontented:<br/>They have cause, since Sapienza's adverse day,<br/>When Genoa conquered: they have further cause,<br/>Since they are nothing in the state, and in<br/>The city worse than nothing--mere machines,<br/>To serve the nobles' most patrician pleasure.<br/>The troops have long arrears of pay, oft promised,<br/>And murmur deeply--any hope of change<br/>Will draw them forward: they shall pay themselves<br/>With plunder:--but the priests--I doubt the priesthood<br/>Will not be with us; they have hated me<br/>Since that rash hour, when, maddened with the drone,<br/>I smote the tardy Bishop at Treviso,<br/>Quickening his holy march; yet, ne'ertheless,<br/>They may be won, at least their Chief at Rome,<br/>By some well-timed concessions; but, above<br/>All things, I must be speedy: at my hour<br/>Of twilight little light of life remains.<br/>Could I free Venice, and avenge my wrongs,<br/>I had lived too long, and willingly would sleep<br/>Next moment with my sires; and, wanting this,<br/>Better that sixty of my fourscore years<br/>Had been already where--how soon, I care not--<br/>The whole must be extinguished;--better that<br/>They ne'er had been, than drag me on to be<br/>The thing these arch-oppressors fain would make me.<br/>Let me consider--of efficient troops<br/>There are three thousand posted at----<br/><br/>             _Enter_ VINCENZO _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.<br/><br/>_Vin_.                                 May it please<br/>Your Highness, the same patron whom I spake of<br/>Is here to crave your patience.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                        Leave the chamber,<br/>Vincenzo.--<br/>                                                     [_Exit_ VINCENZO.<br/>            Sir, you may advance--what would you?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.  Redress.<br/><br/>_Doge_.             Of whom?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                    Of God and of the Doge.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Alas! my friend, you seek it of the twain<br/>Of least respect and interest in Venice.<br/>You must address the Council.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                    'Twere in vain;<br/>For he who injured me is one of them.<br/><br/>_Doge_. There's blood upon thy face--how came it there?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. 'Tis mine, and not the first I've shed for Venice,<br/>But the first shed by a Venetian hand:<br/>A noble smote me.<br/><br/>_Doge_.          Doth he live?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                     Not long--<br/>But for the hope I had and have, that you,<br/>My Prince, yourself a soldier, will redress<br/>Him, whom the laws of discipline and Venice<br/>Permit not to protect himself:--if not--<br/>I say no more.<br/><br/>_Doge_.        But something you would do--<br/>Is it not so?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.     I am a man, my Lord.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Why so is he who smote you.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                          He is called so;<br/>Nay, more, a noble one--at least, in Venice:<br/>But since he hath forgotten that I am one,<br/>And treats me like a brute, the brute may turn--<br/>'Tis said the worm will.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                 Say--his name and lineage?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Barbaro.<br/><br/>_Doge_.           What was the cause? or the pretext?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. I am the chief of the arsenal, employed<br/>At present in repairing certain galleys<br/>But roughly used by the Genoese last year.<br/>This morning comes the noble Barbaro<br/>Full of reproof, because our artisans<br/>Had left some frivolous order of his house,<br/>To execute the state's decree: I dared<br/>To justify the men--he raised his hand;--<br/>Behold my blood! the first time it e'er flowed<br/>Dishonourably.<br/><br/>_Doge_.        Have you long time served?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. So long as to remember Zara's siege,<br/>And fight beneath the Chief who beat the Huns there,<br/>Sometime my general, now the Doge Faliero.--<br/><br/>_Doge_. How! are we comrades?--the State's ducal robes<br/>Sit newly on me, and you were appointed<br/>Chief of the arsenal ere I came from Rome;<br/>So that I recognised you not. Who placed you?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. The late Doge; keeping still my old command<br/>As patron of a galley: my new office<br/>Was given as the reward of certain scars<br/>(So was your predecessor pleased to say):<br/>I little thought his bounty would conduct me<br/>To his successor as a helpless plaintiff;<br/>At least, in such a cause.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   Are you much hurt?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Irreparably in my self-esteem.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Speak out; fear nothing: being stung at heart,<br/>What would you do to be revenged on this man?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. That which I dare not name, and yet will do.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Then wherefore came you here?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                             I come for justice,<br/>Because my general is Doge, and will not<br/>See his old soldier trampled on. Had any,<br/>Save Faliero, filled the ducal throne,<br/>This blood had been washed out in other blood.<br/><br/>_Doge_. You come to me for justice--unto _me!_<br/>The Doge of Venice, and I cannot give it;<br/>I cannot even obtain it--'twas denied<br/>To me most solemnly an hour ago!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. How says your Highness?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           Steno is condemned<br/>To a month's confinement.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                 What! the same who dared<br/>To stain the ducal throne with those foul words,<br/>That have cried shame to every ear in Venice?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Aye, doubtless they have echoed o'er the arsenal,<br/>Keeping due time with every hammer's clink,<br/>As a good jest to jolly artisans;<br/>Or making chorus to the creaking oar,<br/>In the vile tune of every galley-slave,<br/>Who, as he sung the merry stave, exulted<br/>_He_ was not a shamed dotard like the Doge.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Is't possible? a month's imprisonment!<br/>No more for Steno?<br/><br/>_Doge_.           You have heard the offence,<br/>And now you know his punishment; and then<br/>You ask redress of _me_! Go to the Forty,<br/>Who passed the sentence upon Michel Steno;<br/>They'll do as much by Barbaro, no doubt.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Ah! dared I speak my feelings!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                 Give them breath.<br/>Mine have no further outrage to endure.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Then, in a word, it rests but on your word<br/>To punish and avenge--I will not say<br/>_My_ petty wrong, for what is a mere blow,<br/>However vile, to such a thing as I am?--<br/>But the base insult done your state and person.<br/><br/>_Doge_. You overrate my power, which is a pageant.<br/>This Cap is not the Monarch's crown; these robes<br/>Might move compassion, like a beggar's rags;<br/>Nay, more, a beggar's are his own, and these<br/>But lent to the poor puppet, who must play<br/>Its part with all its empire in this ermine.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be King?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                        Yes--of a happy people.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be sovereign lord of Venice?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                            Aye,<br/>If that the people shared that sovereignty,<br/>So that nor they nor I were further slaves<br/>To this o'ergrown aristocratic Hydra,<br/>The poisonous heads of whose envenomed body<br/>Have breathed a pestilence upon us all.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Yet, thou wast born, and still hast lived, patrician.<br/><br/>_Doge_. In evil hour was I so born; my birth<br/>Hath made me Doge to be insulted: but<br/>I lived and toiled a soldier and a servant<br/>Of Venice and her people, not the Senate;<br/>Their good and my own honour were my guerdon.<br/>I have fought and bled; commanded, aye, and conquered;<br/>Have made and marred peace oft in embassies,<br/>As it might chance to be our country's 'vantage;<br/>Have traversed land and sea in constant duty,<br/>Through almost sixty years, and still for Venice,<br/>My fathers' and my birthplace, whose dear spires,<br/>Rising at distance o'er the blue Lagoon,<br/>It was reward enough for me to view<br/>Once more; but not for any knot of men,<br/>Nor sect, nor faction, did I bleed or sweat!<br/>But would you know why I have done all this?<br/>Ask of the bleeding pelican why she<br/>Hath ripped her bosom? Had the bird a voice,<br/>She'd tell thee 'twas for _all_ her little ones.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. And yet they made thee Duke.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           _They made_ me so;<br/>I sought it not, the flattering fetters met me<br/>Returning from my Roman embassy,<br/>And never having hitherto refused<br/>Toil, charge, or duty for the state, I did not,<br/>At these late years, decline what was the highest<br/>Of all in seeming, but of all most base<br/>In what we have to do and to endure:<br/>Bear witness for me thou, my injured subject,<br/>When I can neither right myself nor thee.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. You shall do both, if you possess the will;<br/>And many thousands more not less oppressed,<br/>Who wait but for a signal--will you give it?<br/><br/>_Doge_. You speak in riddles.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                     Which shall soon be read<br/>At peril of my life--if you disdain not<br/>To lend a patient ear.<br/><br/>_Doge_.               Say on.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                       Not thou,<br/>Nor I alone, are injured and abused,<br/>Contemned and trampled on; but the whole people<br/>Groan with the strong conception of their wrongs:<br/>The foreign soldiers in the Senate's pay<br/>Are discontented for their long arrears;<br/>The native mariners, and civic troops,<br/>Feel with their friends; for who is he amongst them<br/>Whose brethren, parents, children, wives, or sisters,<br/>Have not partook oppression, or pollution,<br/>From the patricians? And the hopeless war<br/>Against the Genoese, which is still maintained<br/>With the plebeian blood, and treasure wrung<br/>From their hard earnings, has inflamed them further:<br/>Even now--but, I forget that speaking thus,<br/>Perhaps I pass the sentence of my death!<br/><br/>_Doge_. And suffering what thou hast done--fear'st thou death?<br/>Be silent then, and live on, to be beaten<br/>By those for whom thou hast bled.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                       No, I will speak<br/>At every hazard; and if Venice' Doge<br/>Should turn delator, be the shame on him,<br/>And sorrow too; for he will lose far more<br/>Than I.<br/><br/>_Doge_. From me fear nothing; out with it!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Know then, that there are met and sworn in secret<br/>A band of brethren, valiant hearts and true;<br/>Men who have proved all fortunes, and have long<br/>Grieved over that of Venice, and have right<br/>To do so; having served her in all climes,<br/>And having rescued her from foreign foes,<br/>Would do the same from those within her walls.<br/>They are not numerous, nor yet too few<br/>For their great purpose; they have arms, and means,<br/>And hearts, and hopes, and faith, and patient courage.<br/><br/>_Doge_. For what then do they pause?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                           An hour to strike.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_aside_). Saint Mark's shall strike that hour!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                    I now have placed<br/>My life, my honour, all my earthly hopes<br/>Within thy power, but in the firm belief<br/>That injuries like ours, sprung from one cause,<br/>Will generate one vengeance: should it be so,<br/>Be our Chief now--our Sovereign hereafter.<br/><br/>_Doge_. How many are ye?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.               I'll not answer that<br/>Till I am answered.<br/><br/>_Doge_.            How, sir! do you menace?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. No; I affirm. I have betrayed myself;<br/>But there's no torture in the mystic wells<br/>Which undermine your palace, nor in those<br/>Not less appalling cells, the "leaden roofs,"<br/>To force a single name from me of others.<br/>The Pozzi and the Piombi were in vain;<br/>They might wring blood from me, but treachery never.<br/>And I would pass the fearful "Bridge of Sighs,"<br/>Joyous that mine must be the last that e'er<br/>Would echo o'er the Stygian wave which flows<br/>Between the murderers and the murdered, washing<br/>The prison and the palace walls: there are<br/>Those who would live to think on't, and avenge me.<br/><br/>_Doge_. If such your power and purpose, why come here<br/>To sue for justice, being in the course<br/>To do yourself due right?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                 Because the man,<br/>Who claims protection from authority,<br/>Showing his confidence and his submission<br/>To that authority, can hardly be<br/>Suspected of combining to destroy it.<br/>Had I sate down too humbly with this blow,<br/>A moody brow and muttered threats had made me<br/>A marked man to the Forty's inquisition;<br/>But loud complaint, however angrily<br/>It shapes its phrase, is little to be feared,<br/>And less distrusted. But, besides all this,<br/>I had another reason.<br/><br/>_Doge_.              What was that?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Some rumours that the Doge was greatly moved<br/>By the reference of the Avogadori<br/>Of Michel Steno's sentence to the Forty<br/>Had reached me. I had served you, honoured you,<br/>And felt that you were dangerously insulted,<br/>Being of an order of such spirits, as<br/>Requite tenfold both good and evil: 'twas<br/>My wish to prove and urge you to redress.<br/>Now you know all; and that I speak the truth,<br/>My peril be the proof.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                 You have deeply ventured;<br/>But all must do so who would greatly win:<br/>Thus far I'll answer you--your secret's safe.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. And is this all?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   Unless with all intrusted,<br/>What would you have me answer?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                     I would have you<br/>Trust him who leaves his life in trust with you.<br/><br/>_Doge_. But I must know your plan, your names, and numbers;<br/>The last may then be doubled, and the former<br/>Matured and strengthened.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                We're enough already;<br/>You are the sole ally we covet now.<br/><br/>_Doge_. But bring me to the knowledge of your chiefs.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. That shall be done upon your formal pledge<br/>To keep the faith that we will pledge to you.<br/><br/>_Doge_. When? where?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.           This night I'll bring to your apartment<br/>Two of the principals: a greater number<br/>Were hazardous.<br/><br/>_Doge_.        Stay, I must think of this.--<br/>What if I were to trust myself amongst you,<br/>And leave the palace?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.            You must come alone.<br/><br/>_Doge_. With but my nephew.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                  Not were he your son!<br/><br/>_Doge_. Wretch! darest thou name my son? He died in arms<br/>At Sapienza for this faithless state.<br/>Oh! that he were alive, and I in ashes!<br/>Or that he were alive ere I be ashes!<br/>I should not need the dubious aid of strangers.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Not one of all those strangers whom thou doubtest,<br/>But will regard thee with a filial feeling,<br/>So that thou keep'st a father's faith with them.<br/><br/>_Doge_. The die is cast. Where is the place of meeting?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. At midnight I will be alone and masked<br/>Where'er your Highness pleases to direct me,<br/>To wait your coming, and conduct you where<br/>You shall receive our homage, and pronounce<br/>Upon our project.<br/><br/>_Doge_.           At what hour arises<br/>The moon?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.  Late, but the atmosphere is thick and dusky,<br/>'Tis a sirocco.<br/><br/>_Doge_.           At the midnight hour, then,<br/>Near to the church where sleep my sires; the same,<br/>Twin-named from the apostles John and Paul;<br/>A gondola, with one oar only, will<br/>Lurk in the narrow channel which glides by.<br/>Be there.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. I will not fail.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                     And now retire----<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. In the full hope your Highness will not falter<br/>In your great purpose. Prince, I take my leave.<br/>                                             [_Exit_ Isreal Bertuccio.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_solus_). At midnight, by the church Saints John and Paul,<br/>Where sleep my noble fathers, I repair--<br/>To what? to hold a council in the dark<br/>With common ruffians leagued to ruin states!<br/>And will not my great sires leap from the vault,<br/>Where lie two Doges who preceded me,<br/>And pluck me down amongst them? Would they could!<br/>For I should rest in honour with the honoured.<br/>Alas! I must not think of them, but those<br/>Who have made me thus unworthy of a name<br/>Noble and brave as aught of consular<br/>On Roman marbles; but I will redeem it<br/>Back to its antique lustre in our annals,<br/>By sweet revenge on all that's base in Venice,<br/>And freedom to the rest, or leave it black<br/>To all the growing calumnies of Time,<br/>Which never spare the fame of him who fails,<br/>But try the C√¶sar, or the Catiline,<br/>By the true touchstone of desert--Success.<br/><br/>ACT II.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_An Apartment in the Ducal Palace_.<br/><br/>       ANGIOLINA (_wife of the_ DOGE) _and_ MARIANNA.<br/><br/>_Ang_. What was the Doge's answer?<br/><br/>_Mar_.                            That he was<br/>That moment summoned to a conference;<br/>But 'tis by this time ended. I perceived<br/>Not long ago the Senators embarking;<br/>And the last gondola may now be seen<br/>Gliding into the throng of barks which stud<br/>The glittering waters.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                Would he were returned!<br/>He has been much disquieted of late;<br/>And Time, which has not tamed his fiery spirit,<br/>Nor yet enfeebled even his mortal frame,<br/>Which seems to be more nourished by a soul<br/>So quick and restless that it would consume<br/>Less hardy clay--Time has but little power<br/>On his resentments or his griefs. Unlike<br/>To other spirits of his order, who,<br/>In the first burst of passion, pour away<br/>Their wrath or sorrow, all things wear in him<br/>An aspect of Eternity: his thoughts,<br/>His feelings, passions, good or evil, all<br/>Have nothing of old age; and his bold brow<br/>Bears but the scars of mind, the thoughts of years,<br/>Not their decrepitude: and he of late<br/>Has been more agitated than his wont.<br/>Would he were come! for I alone have power<br/>Upon his troubled spirit.<br/><br/>_Mar_.                    It is true,<br/>His Highness has of late been greatly moved<br/>By the affront of Steno, and with cause:<br/>But the offender doubtless even now<br/>Is doomed to expiate his rash insult with<br/>Such chastisement as will enforce respect<br/>To female virtue, and to noble blood.<br/><br/>_Ang_. 'Twas a gross insult; but I heed it not<br/>For the rash scorner's falsehood in itself,<br/>But for the effect, the deadly deep impression<br/>Which it has made upon Faliero's soul,<br/>The proud, the fiery, the austere--austere<br/>To all save me: I tremble when I think<br/>To what it may conduct.<br/><br/>_Mar_.                  Assuredly<br/>The Doge can not suspect you?<br/><br/>_Ang_.                        Suspect _me!_<br/>Why Steno dared not: when he scrawled his lie,<br/>Grovelling by stealth in the moon's glimmering light,<br/>His own still conscience smote him for the act,<br/>And every shadow on the walls frowned shame<br/>Upon his coward calumny.<br/><br/>_Mar_.                   'Twere fit<br/>He should be punished grievously.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                            He is so.<br/><br/>_Mar_. What! is the sentence passed? is he condemned?<br/><br/>_Ang_. I know not that, but he has been detected.<br/><br/>_Mar_. And deem you this enough for such foul scorn?<br/><br/>_Ang_. I would not be a judge in my own cause,<br/>Nor do I know what sense of punishment<br/>May reach the soul of ribalds such as Steno;<br/>But if his insults sink no deeper in<br/>The minds of the inquisitors than they<br/>Have ruffled mine, he will, for all acquittance,<br/>Be left to his own shamelessness or shame.<br/><br/>_Mar_. Some sacrifice is due to slandered virtue.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Why, what is virtue if it needs a victim?<br/>Or if it must depend upon men's words?<br/>The dying Roman said, "'twas but a name:"<br/>It were indeed no more, if human breath<br/>Could make or mar it.<br/><br/>_Mar_.                Yet full many a dame,<br/>Stainless and faithful, would feel all the wrong<br/>Of such a slander; and less rigid ladies,<br/>Such as abound in Venice, would be loud<br/>And all-inexorable in their cry<br/>For justice.<br/><br/>_Ang_.       This but proves it is the name<br/>And not the quality they prize: the first<br/>Have found it a hard task to hold their honour,<br/>If they require it to be blazoned forth;<br/>And those who have not kept it, seek its seeming<br/>As they would look out for an ornament<br/>Of which they feel the want, but not because<br/>They think it so; they live in others' thoughts,<br/>And would seem honest as they must seem fair.<br/><br/>_Mar_. You have strange thoughts for a patrician dame.<br/><br/>_Ang_. And yet they were my father's; with his name,<br/>The sole inheritance he left.<br/><br/>_Mar_.                        You want none;<br/>Wife to a Prince, the Chief of the Republic.<br/><br/>_Ang_. I should have sought none though a peasant's bride,<br/>But feel not less the love and gratitude<br/>Due to my father, who bestowed my hand<br/>Upon his early, tried, and trusted friend,<br/>The Count Val di Marino, now our Doge.<br/><br/>_Mar_. And with that hand did he bestow your heart?<br/><br/>_Ang_. He did so, or it had not been bestowed.<br/><br/>_Mar_. Yet this strange disproportion in your years,<br/>And, let me add, disparity of tempers,<br/>Might make the world doubt whether such an union<br/>Could make you wisely, permanently happy.<br/><br/>_Ang_. The world will think with worldlings; but my heart<br/>Has still been in my duties, which are many,<br/>But never difficult.<br/><br/>_Mar_.               And do you love him?<br/><br/>_Ang_. I love all noble qualities which merit<br/>Love, and I loved my father, who first taught me<br/>To single out what we should love in others,<br/>And to subdue all tendency to lend<br/>The best and purest feelings of our nature<br/>To baser passions. He bestowed my hand<br/>Upon Faliero: he had known him noble,<br/>Brave, generous; rich in all the qualities<br/>Of soldier, citizen, and friend; in all<br/>Such have I found him as my father said.<br/>His faults are those that dwell in the high bosoms<br/>Of men who have commanded; too much pride,<br/>And the deep passions fiercely fostered by<br/>The uses of patricians, and a life<br/>Spent in the storms of state and war; and also<br/>From the quick sense of honour, which becomes<br/>A duty to a certain sign, a vice<br/>When overstrained, and this I fear in him.<br/>And then he has been rash from his youth upwards,<br/>Yet tempered by redeeming nobleness<br/>In such sort, that the wariest of republics<br/>Has lavished all its chief employs upon him,<br/>From his first fight to his last embassy,<br/>From which on his return the Dukedom met him.<br/><br/>_Mar_. But previous to this marriage, had your heart<br/>Ne'er beat for any of the noble youth,<br/>Such as in years had been more meet to match<br/>Beauty like yours? or, since, have you ne'er seen<br/>One, who, if your fair hand were still to give,<br/>Might now pretend to Loredano's daughter?<br/><br/>_Ang_. I answered your first question when I said<br/>I married.<br/><br/>_Mar_.      And the second?<br/><br/>_Ang_.                     Needs no answer.<br/><br/>_Mar_. I pray you pardon, if I have offended.<br/><br/>_Ang_. I feel no wrath, but some surprise: I knew not<br/>That wedded bosoms could permit themselves<br/>To ponder upon what they _now_ might choose,<br/>Or aught save their past choice.<br/><br/>_Mar_.                           'Tis their past choice<br/>That far too often makes them deem they would<br/>Now choose more wisely, could they cancel it.<br/><br/>_Ang_. It may be so. I knew not of such thoughts.<br/><br/>_Mar_. Here comes the Doge--shall I retire?<br/><br/>_Ang_.                                      It may<br/>Be better you should quit me; he seems rapt<br/>In thought.--How pensively he takes his way!<br/>                                                     [_Exit_ MARIANNA.<br/><br/>                  _Enter the_ DOGE _and_ PIETRO.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_musing_). There is a certain Philip Calendaro<br/>Now in the Arsenal, who holds command<br/>Of eighty men, and has great influence<br/>Besides on all the spirits of his comrades:<br/>This man, I hear, is bold and popular,<br/>Sudden and daring, and yet secret; 'twould<br/>Be well that he were won: I needs must hope<br/>That Israel Bertuccio has secured him,<br/>But fain would be----<br/><br/>_Pie_.               My Lord, pray pardon me<br/>For breaking in upon your meditation;<br/>The Senator Bertuccio, your kinsman,<br/>Charged me to follow and enquire your pleasure<br/>To fix an hour when he may speak with you.<br/><br/>_Doge_. At sunset.--Stay a moment--let me see--<br/>Say in the second hour of night.                       [_Exit_ PIETRO.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                           My Lord!<br/><br/>_Doge_. My dearest child, forgive me--why delay<br/>So long approaching me?--I saw you not.<br/><br/>_Ang_. You were absorbed in thought, and he who now<br/>Has parted from you might have words of weight<br/>To bear you from the Senate.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                     From the Senate?<br/><br/>_Ang_. I would not interrupt him in his duty<br/>And theirs.<br/><br/>_Doge_.    The Senate's duty! you mistake;<br/>'Tis we who owe all service to the Senate.<br/><br/>_Ang_. I thought the Duke had held command in Venice.<br/><br/>_Doge_. He shall.--But let that pass.--We will be jocund.<br/>How fares it with you? have you been abroad?<br/>The day is overcast, but the calm wave<br/>Favours the gondolier's light skimming oar;<br/>Or have you held a levee of your friends?<br/>Or has your music made you solitary?<br/>Say--is there aught that you would will within<br/>The little sway now left the Duke? or aught<br/>Of fitting splendour, or of honest pleasure,<br/>Social or lonely, that would glad your heart,<br/>To compensate for many a dull hour, wasted<br/>On an old man oft moved with many cares?<br/>Speak, and 'tis done.<br/><br/>_Ang_.               You're ever kind to me.<br/>I have nothing to desire, or to request,<br/>Except to see you oftener and calmer.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Calmer?<br/><br/>_Ang_.         Aye, calmer, my good Lord.--Ah, why<br/>Do you still keep apart, and walk alone,<br/>And let such strong emotions stamp your brow,<br/>As not betraying their full import, yet<br/>Disclose too much?<br/><br/>_Doge_.            Disclose too much!--of what?<br/>What is there to disclose?<br/><br/>_Ang_.                    A heart so ill<br/>At ease.<br/><br/>_Doge_.    'Tis nothing, child.--But in the state<br/>You know what daily cares oppress all those<br/>Who govern this precarious commonwealth;<br/>Now suffering from the Genoese without,<br/>And malcontents within--'tis this which makes me<br/>More pensive and less tranquil than my wont.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Yet this existed long before, and never<br/>Till in these late days did I see you thus.<br/>Forgive me; there is something at your heart<br/>More than the mere discharge of public duties,<br/>Which long use and a talent like to yours<br/>Have rendered light, nay, a necessity,<br/>To keep your mind from stagnating. 'Tis not<br/>In hostile states, nor perils, thus to shake you,--<br/>You, who have stood all storms and never sunk,<br/>And climbed up to the pinnacle of power<br/>And never fainted by the way, and stand<br/>Upon it, and can look down steadily<br/>Along the depth beneath, and ne'er feel dizzy.<br/>Were Genoa's galleys riding in the port,<br/>Were civil fury raging in Saint Mark's,<br/>You are not to be wrought on, but would fall,<br/>As you have risen, with an unaltered brow:<br/>Your feelings now are of a different kind;<br/>Something has stung your pride, not patriotism.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Pride! Angiolina? Alas! none is left me.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Yes--the same sin that overthrew the angels,<br/>And of all sins most easily besets<br/>Mortals the nearest to the angelic nature:<br/>The vile are only vain; the great are proud.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I _had_ the pride of honour, of _your_ honour,<br/>Deep at my heart--But let us change the theme.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Ah no!--As I have ever shared your kindness<br/>In all things else, let me not be shut out<br/>From your distress: were it of public import,<br/>You know I never sought, would never seek<br/>To win a word from you; but feeling now<br/>Your grief is private, it belongs to me<br/>To lighten or divide it. Since the day<br/>When foolish Steno's ribaldry detected<br/>Unfixed your quiet, you are greatly changed,<br/>And I would soothe you back to what you were.<br/><br/>_Doge_. To what I was!--have you heard Steno's sentence?<br/><br/>_Ang_. No.<br/><br/>_Doge_.     A month's arrest.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                        Is it not enough?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Enough!--yes, for a drunken galley slave,<br/>Who, stung by stripes, may murmur at his master;<br/>But not for a deliberate, false, cool villain,<br/>Who stains a Lady's and a Prince's honour<br/>Even on the throne of his authority.<br/><br/>_Ang_. There seems to be enough in the conviction<br/>Of a patrician guilty of a falsehood:<br/>All other punishment were light unto<br/>His loss of honour.<br/><br/>_Doge_.             Such men have no honour;<br/>They have but their vile lives--and these are spared.<br/><br/>_Ang_. You would not have him die for this offence?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Not _now_:--being still alive, I'd have him live<br/>Long as _he_ can; he has ceased to merit death;<br/>The guilty saved hath damned his hundred judges,<br/>And he is pure, for now his crime is theirs.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Oh! had this false and flippant libeller<br/>Shed his young blood for his absurd lampoon,<br/>Ne'er from that moment could this breast have known<br/>A joyous hour, or dreamless slumber more.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Does not the law of Heaven say blood for blood?<br/>And he who _taints_ kills more than he who sheds it.<br/>Is it the _pain_ of blows, or _shame_ of blows,<br/>That makes such deadly to the sense of man?<br/>Do not the laws of man say blood for honour,--<br/>And, less than honour, for a little gold?<br/>Say not the laws of nations blood for treason?<br/>Is't nothing to have filled these veins with poison<br/>For their once healthful current? is it nothing<br/>To have stained your name and mine--the noblest names?<br/>Is't nothing to have brought into contempt<br/>A Prince before his people? to have failed<br/>In the respect accorded by Mankind<br/>To youth in woman, and old age in man?<br/>To virtue in your sex, and dignity<br/>In ours?--But let them look to it who have saved him.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Heaven bids us to forgive our enemies.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Doth Heaven forgive her own? Is there not Hell<br/>For wrath eternal?<br/><br/>_Ang_.                  Do not speak thus wildly--<br/>Heaven will alike forgive you and your foes.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Amen! May Heaven forgive them!<br/><br/>_Ang_.                                And will you?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Yes, when they are in Heaven!<br/><br/>_Ang_.                                And not till then?<br/><br/>_Doge_. What matters my forgiveness? an old man's,<br/>Worn out, scorned, spurned, abused; what matters then<br/>My pardon more than my resentment, both<br/>Being weak and worthless? I have lived too long;<br/>But let us change the argument.--My child!<br/>My injured wife, the child of Loredano,<br/>The brave, the chivalrous, how little deemed<br/>Thy father, wedding thee unto his friend,<br/>That he was linking thee to shame!--Alas!<br/>Shame without sin, for thou art faultless. Hadst thou<br/>But had a different husband, _any_ husband<br/>In Venice save the Doge, this blight, this brand,<br/>This blasphemy had never fallen upon thee.<br/>So young, so beautiful, so good, so pure,<br/>To suffer this, and yet be unavenged!<br/><br/>_Ang_. I am too well avenged, for you still love me,<br/>And trust, and honour me; and all men know<br/>That you are just, and I am true: what more<br/>Could I require, or you command?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                          'Tis well,<br/>And may be better; but whate'er betide,<br/>Be thou at least kind to my memory.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Why speak you thus?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                    It is no matter why;<br/>But I would still, whatever others think,<br/>Have your respect both now and in my grave.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Why should you doubt it? has it ever failed?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Come hither, child! I would a word with you.<br/>Your father was my friend; unequal Fortune<br/>Made him my debtor for some courtesies<br/>Which bind the good more firmly: when, oppressed<br/>With his last malady, he willed our union,<br/>It was not to repay me, long repaid<br/>Before by his great loyalty in friendship;<br/>His object was to place your orphan beauty<br/>In honourable safety from the perils,<br/>Which, in this scorpion nest of vice, assail<br/>A lonely and undowered maid. I did not<br/>Think with him, but would not oppose the thought<br/>Which soothed his death-bed.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                       I have not forgotten<br/>The nobleness with which you bade me speak<br/>If my young heart held any preference<br/>Which would have made me happier; nor your offer<br/>To make my dowry equal to the rank<br/>Of aught in Venice, and forego all claim<br/>My father's last injunction gave you.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                               Thus,<br/>'Twas not a foolish dotard's vile caprice,<br/>Nor the false edge of ag√©d appetite,<br/>Which made me covetous of girlish beauty,<br/>And a young bride: for in my fieriest youth<br/>I swayed such passions; nor was this my age<br/>Infected with that leprosy of lust<br/>Which taints the hoariest years of vicious men,<br/>Making them ransack to the very last<br/>The dregs of pleasure for their vanished joys;<br/>Or buy in selfish marriage some young victim,<br/>Too helpless to refuse a state that's honest,<br/>Too feeling not to know herself a wretch.<br/>Our wedlock was not of this sort; you had<br/>Freedom from me to choose, and urged in answer<br/>Your father's choice.<br/><br/>_Ang_.               I did so; I would do so<br/>In face of earth and Heaven; for I have never<br/>Repented for my sake; sometimes for yours,<br/>In pondering o'er your late disquietudes.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I knew my heart would never treat you harshly:<br/>I knew my days could not disturb you long;<br/>And then the daughter of my earliest friend,<br/>His worthy daughter, free to choose again.<br/>Wealthier and wiser, in the ripest bloom<br/>Of womanhood, more skilful to select<br/>By passing these probationary years,<br/>Inheriting a Prince's name and riches,<br/>Secured, by the short penance of enduring<br/>An old man for some summers, against all<br/>That law's chicane or envious kinsmen might<br/>Have urged against her right; my best friend's child<br/>Would choose more fitly in respect of years,<br/>And not less truly in a faithful heart.<br/><br/>_Ang_. My Lord, I looked but to my father's wishes,<br/>Hallowed by his last words, and to my heart<br/>For doing all its duties, and replying<br/>With faith to him with whom I was affianced.<br/>Ambitious hopes ne'er crossed my dreams; and should<br/>The hour you speak of come, it will be seen so.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I do believe you; and I know you true:<br/>For Love--romantic Love--which in my youth<br/>I knew to be illusion, and ne'er saw<br/>Lasting, but often fatal, it had been<br/>No lure for me, in my most passionate days,<br/>And could not be so now, did such exist.<br/>But such respect, and mildly paid regard<br/>As a true feeling for your welfare, and<br/>A free compliance with all honest wishes,--<br/>A kindness to your virtues, watchfulness<br/>Not shown, but shadowing o'er such little failings<br/>As Youth is apt in, so as not to check<br/>Rashly, but win you from them ere you knew<br/>You had been won, but thought the change your choice;<br/>A pride not in your beauty, but your conduct;<br/>A trust in you; a patriarchal love,<br/>And not a doting homage; friendship, faith,--<br/>Such estimation in your eyes as these<br/>Might claim, I hoped for.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                   And have ever had.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I think so. For the difference in our years<br/>You knew it choosing me, and chose; I trusted<br/>Not to my qualities, nor would have faith<br/>In such, nor outward ornaments of nature,<br/>Were I still in my five and twentieth spring;<br/>I trusted to the blood of Loredano<br/>Pure in your veins; I trusted to the soul<br/>God gave you--to the truths your father taught you--<br/>To your belief in Heaven--to your mild virtues--<br/>To your own faith and honour, for my own.<br/><br/>_Ang_. You have done well.--I thank you for that trust,<br/>Which I have never for one moment ceased<br/>To honour you the more for.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                      Where is Honour,<br/>Innate and precept-strengthened, 'tis the rock<br/>Of faith connubial: where it is not--where<br/>Light thoughts are lurking, or the vanities<br/>Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart,<br/>Or sensual throbs convulse it, well I know<br/>'Twere hopeless for humanity to dream<br/>Of honesty in such infected blood,<br/>Although 'twere wed to him it covets most:<br/>An incarnation of the poet's God<br/>In all his marble-chiselled beauty, or<br/>The demi-deity, Alcides, in<br/>His majesty of superhuman Manhood,<br/>Would not suffice to bind where virtue is not;<br/>It is consistency which forms and proves it:<br/>Vice cannot fix, and Virtue cannot change.<br/>The once fall'n woman must for ever fall;<br/>For Vice must have variety, while Virtue<br/>Stands like the Sun, and all which rolls around<br/>Drinks life, and light, and glory from her aspect.<br/><br/>_Ang_. And seeing, feeling thus this truth in others,<br/>(I pray you pardon me;) but wherefore yield you<br/>To the most fierce of fatal passions, and<br/>Disquiet your great thoughts with restless hate<br/>Of such a thing as Steno?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                  You mistake me.<br/>It is not Steno who could move me thus;<br/>Had it been so, he should--but let that pass.<br/><br/>_Ang_. What is't you feel so deeply, then, even now?<br/><br/>_Doge_. The violated majesty of Venice,<br/>At once insulted in her Lord and laws.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Alas! why will you thus consider it?<br/><br/>_Doge_. I have thought on't till--but let me lead you back<br/>To what I urged; all these things being noted,<br/>I wedded you; the world then did me justice<br/>Upon the motive, and my conduct proved<br/>They did me right, while yours was all to praise:<br/>You had all freedom--all respect--all trust<br/>From me and mine; and, born of those who made<br/>Princes at home, and swept Kings from their thrones<br/>On foreign shores, in all things you appeared<br/>Worthy to be our first of native dames.<br/><br/>_Ang_. To what does this conduct?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           To thus much--that<br/>A miscreant's angry breath may blast it all--<br/>A villain, whom for his unbridled bearing,<br/>Even in the midst of our great festival,<br/>I caused to be conducted forth, and taught<br/>How to demean himself in ducal chambers;<br/>A wretch like this may leave upon the wall<br/>The blighting venom of his sweltering heart,<br/>And this shall spread itself in general poison;<br/>And woman's innocence, man's honour, pass<br/>Into a by-word; and the doubly felon<br/>(Who first insulted virgin modesty<br/>By a gross affront to your attendant damsels<br/>Amidst the noblest of our dames in public)<br/>Requite himself for his most just expulsion<br/>By blackening publicly his Sovereign's consort,<br/>And be absolved by his upright compeers.<br/><br/>_Ang_. But he has been condemned into captivity.<br/><br/>_Doge_. For such as him a dungeon were acquittal;<br/>And his brief term of mock-arrest will pass<br/>Within a palace. But I've done with him;<br/>The rest must be with you.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                     With me, my Lord?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Yes, Angiolina. Do not marvel; I<br/>Have let this prey upon me till I feel<br/>My life cannot be long; and fain would have you<br/>Regard the injunctions you will find within<br/>This scroll (_giving her a paper_)<br/>           ----Fear not; they are for your advantage:<br/>Read them hereafter at the fitting hour.<br/><br/>_Ang_. My Lord, in life, and after life, you shall<br/>Be honoured still by me: but may your days<br/>Be many yet--and happier than the present!<br/>This passion will give way, and you will be<br/>Serene, and what you should be--what you were.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I will be what I should be, or be nothing;<br/>But never more--oh! never, never more,<br/>O'er the few days or hours which yet await<br/>The blighted old age of Faliero, shall<br/>Sweet Quiet shed her sunset! Never more<br/>Those summer shadows rising from the past<br/>Of a not ill-spent nor inglorious life,<br/>Mellowing the last hours as the night approaches,<br/>Shall soothe me to my moment of long rest.<br/>I had but little more to ask, or hope,<br/>Save the regards due to the blood and sweat,<br/>And the soul's labour through which I had toiled<br/>To make my country honoured. As her servant--<br/>Her servant, though her chief--I would have gone<br/>Down to my fathers with a name serene<br/>And pure as theirs; but this has been denied me.<br/>Would I had died at Zara!<br/><br/>_Ang_.                   There you saved<br/>The state; then live to save her still. A day,<br/>Another day like that would be the best<br/>Reproof to them, and sole revenge for you.<br/><br/>_Doge_. But one such day occurs within an age;<br/>My life is little less than one, and 'tis<br/>Enough for Fortune to have granted _once_,<br/>That which scarce one more favoured citizen<br/>May win in many states and years. But why<br/>Thus speak I? Venice has forgot that day--<br/>Then why should I remember it?--Farewell,<br/>Sweet Angiolina! I must to my cabinet;<br/>There's much for me to do--and the hour hastens.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Remember what you were.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                        It were in vain!<br/>Joy's recollection is no longer joy,<br/>While Sorrow's memory is a sorrow still.<br/><br/>_Ang_. At least, whate'er may urge, let me implore<br/>That you will take some little pause of rest:<br/>Your sleep for many nights has been so turbid,<br/>That it had been relief to have awaked you,<br/>Had I not hoped that Nature would o'erpower<br/>At length the thoughts which shook your slumbers thus.<br/>An hour of rest will give you to your toils<br/>With fitter thoughts and freshened strength.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                      I cannot--<br/>I must not, if I could; for never was<br/>Such reason to be watchful: yet a few--<br/>Yet a few days and dream-perturb√©d nights,<br/>And I shall slumber well--but where?--no matter.<br/>Adieu, my Angiolina.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                 Let me be<br/>An instant--yet an instant your companion!<br/>I cannot bear to leave you thus.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                          Come then,<br/>My gentle child--forgive me: thou wert made<br/>For better fortunes than to share in mine,<br/>Now darkling in their close toward the deep vale<br/>Where Death sits robed in his all-sweeping shadow.<br/>When I am gone--it may be sooner than<br/>Even these years warrant, for there is that stirring<br/>Within--above--around, that in this city<br/>Will make the cemeteries populous<br/>As e'er they were by pestilence or war,--<br/>When I _am_ nothing, let that which I _was_<br/>Be still sometimes a name on thy sweet lips,<br/>A shadow in thy fancy, of a thing<br/>Which would not have thee mourn it, but remember.<br/>Let us begone, my child--the time is pressing.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_A retired spot near the Arsenal_.<br/><br/>          ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO.<br/><br/>_Cal_. How sped you, Israel, in your late complaint?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Why, well.<br/><br/>_Cal_.               Is't possible! will he be punished?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                                Yes.<br/><br/>_Cal_. With what? a mulct or an arrest?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                With death!<br/><br/>_Cal_. Now you rave, or must intend revenge,<br/>Such as I counselled you, with your own hand.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Yes; and for one sole draught of hate, forego<br/>The great redress we meditate for Venice,<br/>And change a life of hope for one of exile;<br/>Leaving one scorpion crushed, and thousands stinging<br/>My friends, my family, my countrymen!<br/>No, Calendaro; these same drops of blood,<br/>Shed shamefully, shall have the whole of his<br/>For their requital----But not only his;<br/>We will not strike for private wrongs alone:<br/>Such are for selfish passions and rash men,<br/>But are unworthy a Tyrannicide.<br/><br/>_Cal_. You have more patience than I care to boast.<br/>Had I been present when you bore this insult,<br/>I must have slain him, or expired myself<br/>In the vain effort to repress my wrath.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Thank Heaven you were not--all had else been marred:<br/>As 'tis, our cause looks prosperous still.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                                    You saw<br/>The Doge--what answer gave he?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                     That there was<br/>No punishment for such as Barbaro.<br/><br/>_Cal_. I told you so before, and that 'twas idle<br/>To think of justice from such hands.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                           At least,<br/>It lulled suspicion, showing confidence.<br/>Had I been silent, not a Sbirro but<br/>Had kept me in his eye, as meditating<br/>A silent, solitary, deep revenge.<br/><br/>_Cal_. But wherefore not address you to the Council?<br/>The Doge is a mere puppet, who can scarce<br/>Obtain right for himself. Why speak to _him_?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. You shall know that hereafter.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                                   Why not now?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Be patient but till midnight. Get your musters,<br/>And bid our friends prepare their companies:<br/>Set all in readiness to strike the blow,<br/>Perhaps in a few hours: we have long waited<br/>For a fit time--that hour is on the dial,<br/>It may be, of to-morrow's sun: delay<br/>Beyond may breed us double danger. See<br/>That all be punctual at our place of meeting,<br/>And armed, excepting those of the Sixteen,<br/>Who will remain among the troops to wait<br/>The signal.<br/><br/>_Cal_.      These brave words have breathed new life<br/>Into my veins; I am sick of these protracted<br/>And hesitating councils: day on day<br/>Crawled on, and added but another link<br/>To our long fetters, and some fresher wrong<br/>Inflicted on our brethren or ourselves,<br/>Helping to swell our tyrants' bloated strength.<br/>Let us but deal upon them, and I care not<br/>For the result, which must be Death or Freedom!<br/>I'm weary to the heart of finding neither.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. We will be free in Life or Death! the grave<br/>Is chainless. Have you all the musters ready?<br/>And are the sixteen companies completed<br/>To sixty?<br/><br/>_Cal_.    All save two, in which there are<br/>Twenty-five wanting to make up the number.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. No matter; we can do without. Whose are they?<br/><br/>_Cal_. Bertram's and old Soranzo's, both of whom<br/>Appear less forward in the cause than we are.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Your fiery nature makes you deem all those<br/>Who are not restless cold; but there exists<br/>Oft in concentred spirits not less daring<br/>Than in more loud avengers. Do not doubt them.<br/><br/>_Cat_. I do not doubt the elder; but in Bertram<br/>There is a hesitating softness, fatal<br/>To enterprise like ours: I've seen that man<br/>Weep like an infant o'er the misery<br/>Of others, heedless of his own, though greater;<br/>And in a recent quarrel I beheld him<br/>Turn sick at sight of blood, although a villain's.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. The truly brave are soft of heart and eyes,<br/>And feel for what their duty bids them do.<br/>I have known Bertram long; there doth not breathe<br/>A soul more full of honour.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                       It may be so:<br/>I apprehend less treachery than weakness;<br/>Yet as he has no mistress, and no wife<br/>To work upon his milkiness of spirit,<br/>He may go through the ordeal; it is well<br/>He is an orphan, friendless save in us:<br/>A woman or a child had made him less<br/>Than either in resolve.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                Such ties are not<br/>For those who are called to the high destinies<br/>Which purify corrupted commonwealths;<br/>We must forget all feelings save the _one_,<br/>We must resign all passions save our purpose,<br/>We must behold no object save our country,<br/>And only look on Death as beautiful,<br/>So that the sacrifice ascend to Heaven,<br/>And draw down Freedom on her evermore.<br/><br/>_Cal_. But if we fail----<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                They never fail who die<br/>In a great cause: the block may soak their gore:<br/>Their heads may sodden in the sun; their limbs<br/>Be strung to city gates and castle walls--<br/>But still their Spirit walks abroad. Though years<br/>Elapse, and others share as dark a doom,<br/>They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts<br/>Which overpower all others, and conduct<br/>The world at last to Freedom. What were we,<br/>If Brutus had not lived? He died in giving<br/>Rome liberty, but left a deathless lesson--<br/>A name which is a virtue, and a Soul<br/>Which multiplies itself throughout all time,<br/>When wicked men wax mighty, and a state<br/>Turns servile. He and his high friend were styled<br/>"The last of Romans!" Let us be the first<br/>Of true Venetians, sprung from Roman sires.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Our fathers did not fly from Attila<br/>Into these isles, where palaces have sprung<br/>On banks redeemed from the rude ocean's ooze,<br/>To own a thousand despots in his place.<br/>Better bow down before the Hun, and call<br/>A Tartar lord, than these swoln silkworms masters!<br/>The first at least was man, and used his sword<br/>As sceptre: these unmanly creeping things<br/>Command our swords, and rule us with a word<br/>As with a spell.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.        It shall be broken soon.<br/>You say that all things are in readiness;<br/>To-day I have not been the usual round,<br/>And why thou knowest; but thy vigilance<br/>Will better have supplied my care: these orders<br/>In recent council to redouble now<br/>Our efforts to repair the galleys, have<br/>Lent a fair colour to the introduction<br/>Of many of our cause into the arsenal,<br/>As new artificers for their equipment,<br/>Or fresh recruits obtained in haste to man<br/>The hoped-for fleet.--Are all supplied with arms?<br/><br/>_Cal_. All who were deemed trust-worthy: there are some<br/>Whom it were well to keep in ignorance<br/>Till it be time to strike, and then supply them;<br/>When in the heat and hurry of the hour<br/>They have no opportunity to pause,<br/>But needs must on with those who will surround them.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. You have said well. Have you remarked all such?<br/><br/>_Cal_. I've noted most; and caused the other chiefs<br/>To use like caution in their companies.<br/>As far as I have seen, we are enough<br/>To make the enterprise secure, if 'tis<br/>Commenced to-morrow; but, till 'tis begun,<br/>Each hour is pregnant with a thousand perils.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Let the Sixteen meet at the wonted hour,<br/>Except Soranzo, Nicoletto Blondo,<br/>And Marco Giuda, who will keep their watch<br/>Within the arsenal, and hold all ready,<br/>Expectant of the signal we will fix on.<br/><br/>_Cal_. We will not fail.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                 Let all the rest be there;<br/>I have a stranger to present to them.<br/><br/>_Cal_. A stranger! doth he know the secret?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                   Yes.<br/><br/>_Cal_. And have you dared to peril your friends' lives<br/>On a rash confidence in one we know not?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. I have risked no man's life except my own--<br/>Of that be certain: he is one who may<br/>Make our assurance doubly sure, according<br/>His aid; and if reluctant, he no less<br/>Is in our power: he comes alone with me,<br/>And cannot 'scape us; but he will not swerve.<br/><br/>_Cal_. I cannot judge of this until I know him:<br/>Is he one of our order?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.              Aye, in spirit,<br/>Although a child of Greatness; he is one<br/>Who would become a throne, or overthrow one--<br/>One who has done great deeds, and seen great changes;<br/>No tyrant, though bred up to tyranny;<br/>Valiant in war, and sage in council; noble<br/>In nature, although haughty; quick, yet wary:<br/>Yet for all this, so full of certain passions,<br/>That if once stirred and baffled, as he has been<br/>Upon the tenderest points, there is no Fury<br/>In Grecian story like to that which wrings<br/>His vitals with her burning hands, till he<br/>Grows capable of all things for revenge;<br/>And add too, that his mind is liberal,<br/>He sees and feels the people are oppressed,<br/>And shares their sufferings. Take him all in all,<br/>We have need of such, and such have need of us.<br/><br/>_Cal_. And what part would you have him take with us?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. It may be, that of Chief.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                              What! and resign<br/>Your own command as leader?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                  Even so.<br/>My object is to make your cause end well,<br/>And not to push myself to power. Experience,<br/>Some skill, and your own choice, had marked me out<br/>To act in trust as your commander, till<br/>Some worthier should appear: if I have found such<br/>As you yourselves shall own more worthy, think you<br/>That I would hesitate from selfishness,<br/>And, covetous of brief authority,<br/>Stake our deep interest on my single thoughts,<br/>Rather than yield to one above me in<br/>All leading qualities? No, Calendaro,<br/>Know your friend better; but you all shall judge.<br/>Away! and let us meet at the fixed hour.<br/>Be vigilant, and all will yet go well.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Worthy Bertuccio, I have known you ever<br/>Trusty and brave, with head and heart to plan<br/>What I have still been prompt to execute.<br/>For my own part, I seek no other Chief;<br/>What the rest will decide, I know not, but<br/>I am with YOU, as I have ever been,<br/>In all our undertakings. Now farewell,<br/>Until the hour of midnight sees us meet.                    [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>ACT III.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_Scene, the Space between the Canal and the<br/>     Church of San Giovanni e San Paolo. An equestrian Statue<br/>    before it.--A Gondola lies in the Canal at some distance._<br/><br/>               _Enter the_ DOGE _alone, disguised_.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_solus_). I am before the hour, the hour whose voice,<br/>Pealing into the arch of night, might strike<br/>These palaces with ominous tottering,<br/>And rock their marbles to the corner-stone,<br/>Waking the sleepers from some hideous dream<br/>Of indistinct but awful augury<br/>Of that which will befall them. Yes, proud city!<br/>Thou must be cleansed of the black blood which makes thee<br/>A lazar-house of tyranny: the task<br/>Is forced upon me, I have sought it not;<br/>And therefore was I punished, seeing this<br/>Patrician pestilence spread on and on,<br/>Until at length it smote me in my slumbers,<br/>And I am tainted, and must wash away<br/>The plague spots in the healing wave. Tall fane!<br/>Where sleep my fathers, whose dim statues shadow<br/>The floor which doth divide us from the dead,<br/>Where all the pregnant hearts of our bold blood,<br/>Mouldered into a mite of ashes, hold<br/>In one shrunk heap what once made many heroes,<br/>When what is now a handful shook the earth--<br/>Fane of the tutelar saints who guard our house!<br/>Vault where two Doges rest--my sires! who died<br/>The one of toil, the other in the field,<br/>With a long race of other lineal chiefs<br/>And sages, whose great labours, wounds, and state<br/>I have inherited,--let the graves gape,<br/>Till all thine aisles be peopled with the dead,<br/>And pour them from thy portals to gaze on me!<br/>I call them up, and them and thee to witness<br/>What it hath been which put me to this task--<br/>Their pure high blood, their blazon-roll of glories,<br/>Their mighty name dishonoured all _in_ me,<br/>Not _by_ me, but by the ungrateful nobles<br/>We fought to make our equals, not our lords:<br/>And chiefly thou, Ordelafo the brave,<br/>Who perished in the field, where I since conquered,<br/>Battling at Zara, did the hecatombs<br/>Of thine and Venice' foes, there offered up<br/>By thy descendant, merit such acquittance?<br/>Spirits! smile down upon me! for my cause<br/>Is yours, in all life now can be of yours,--<br/>Your fame, your name, all mingled up in mine,<br/>And in the future fortunes of our race!<br/>Let me but prosper, and I make this city<br/>Free and immortal, and our House's name<br/>Worthier of what you were--now and hereafter!<br/><br/>                    _Enter_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Who goes there?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                  A friend to Venice.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                    'Tis he.<br/>Welcome, my Lord,--you are before the time.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I am ready to proceed to your assembly.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Have with you.--I am proud and pleased to see<br/>Such confident alacrity. Your doubts<br/>Since our last meeting, then, are all dispelled?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Not so--but I have set my little left<br/>Of life upon this cast: the die was thrown<br/>When I first listened to your treason.--Start not!<br/>_That_ is the word; I cannot shape my tongue<br/>To syllable black deeds into smooth names,<br/>Though I be wrought on to commit them. When<br/>I heard you tempt your Sovereign, and forbore<br/>To have you dragged to prison, I became<br/>Your guiltiest accomplice: now you may,<br/>If it so please you, do as much by me.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Strange words, my Lord, and most unmerited;<br/>I am no spy, and neither are we traitors.<br/><br/>_Doge_. _We--We!_--no matter--you have earned the right<br/>To talk of _us_.--But to the point.--If this<br/>Attempt succeeds, and Venice, rendered free<br/>And flourishing, when we are in our graves,<br/>Conducts her generations to our tombs,<br/>And makes her children with their little hands<br/>Strew flowers o'er her deliverers' ashes, then<br/>The consequence will sanctify the deed,<br/>And we shall be like the two Bruti in<br/>The annals of hereafter; but if not,<br/>If we should fail, employing bloody means<br/>And secret plot, although to a good end,<br/>Still we are traitors, honest Israel;--thou<br/>No less than he who was thy Sovereign<br/>Six hours ago, and now thy brother rebel.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. 'Tis not the moment to consider thus,<br/>Else I could answer.--Let us to the meeting,<br/>Or we may be observed in lingering here.<br/><br/>_Doge_. We _are_ observed, and have been.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                 We observed!<br/>Let me discover--and this steel-----<br/><br/>_Doge_.                         Put up;<br/>Here are no human witnesses: look there--<br/>What see you?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.    Only a tall warrior's statue<br/>Bestriding a proud steed, in the dim light<br/>Of the dull moon.<br/><br/>_Doge_.           That Warrior was the sire<br/>Of my sire's fathers, and that statue was<br/>Decreed to him by the twice rescued city:--<br/>Think you that he looks down on us or no?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. My Lord, these are mere fantasies; there are<br/>No eyes in marble.<br/><br/>_Doge_.       But there are in Death.<br/>I tell thee, man, there is a spirit in<br/>Such things that acts and sees, unseen, though felt;<br/>And, if there be a spell to stir the dead,<br/>'Tis in such deeds as we are now upon.<br/>Deem'st thou the souls of such a race as mine<br/>Can rest, when he, their last descendant Chief,<br/>Stands plotting on the brink of their pure graves<br/>With stung plebeians?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.            It had been as well<br/>To have pondered this before,--ere you embarked<br/>In our great enterprise.--Do you repent?<br/><br/>_Doge_. No--but I _feel_, and shall do to the last.<br/>I cannot quench a glorious life at once,<br/>Nor dwindle to the thing I now must be,<br/>And take men's lives by stealth, without some pause:<br/>Yet doubt me not; it is this very feeling,<br/>And knowing _what_ has wrung me to be thus,<br/>Which is your best security. There's not<br/>A roused mechanic in your busy plot<br/>So wronged as I, so fall'n, so loudly called<br/>To his redress: the very means I am forced<br/>By these fell tyrants to adopt is such,<br/>That I abhor them doubly for the deeds<br/>Which I must do to pay them back for theirs.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Let us away--hark--the Hour strikes.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                        On--on--<br/>It is our knell, or that of Venice.--On.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Say rather, 'tis her Freedom's rising peal<br/>Of Triumph. This way--we are near the place.<br/>                                                            [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_The House where the Conspirators meet._<br/><br/>      DAGOLINO, DORO, BERTRAM, FEDELE TREVISANO, CALENDARO,<br/>                 ANTONIO DELLE BENDE, ETC., ETC.<br/><br/>_Cal_. (_entering_). Are all here?<br/><br/>_Dag_.                           All with you; except the three<br/>On duty, and our leader Israel,<br/>Who is expected momently.<br/><br/>_Cal_.               Where's Bertram?<br/><br/>_Ber_. Here!<br/><br/>_Cal_.       Have you not been able to complete<br/>The number wanting in your company?<br/><br/>_Ber_. I had marked out some: but I have not dared<br/>To trust them with the secret, till assured<br/>That they were worthy faith.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                       There is no need<br/>Of trusting to their faith; _who_, save ourselves<br/>And our more chosen comrades, is aware<br/>Fully of our intent? they think themselves<br/>Engaged in secret to the Signory,<br/>To punish some more dissolute young nobles<br/>Who have defied the law in their excesses;<br/>But once drawn up, and their new swords well fleshed<br/>In the rank hearts of the more odious Senators,<br/>They will not hesitate to follow up<br/>Their blow upon the others, when they see<br/>The example of their chiefs, and I for one<br/>Will set them such, that they for very shame<br/>And safety will not pause till all have perished.<br/><br/>_Ber_. How say you? _all!_<br/><br/>_Cal_.                     Whom wouldst thou spare?<br/><br/>_Ber_.                                         _I spare?_<br/>I have no power to spare. I only questioned,<br/>Thinking that even amongst these wicked men<br/>There might be some, whose age and qualities<br/>Might mark them out for pity.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                       Yes, such pity<br/>As when the viper hath been cut to pieces,<br/>The separate fragments quivering in the sun,<br/>In the last energy of venomous life,<br/>Deserve and have. Why, I should think as soon<br/>Of pitying some particular fang which made<br/>One in the jaw of the swoln serpent, as<br/>Of saving one of these: they form but links<br/>Of one long chain; one mass, one breath, one body;<br/>They eat, and drink, and live, and breed together,<br/>Revel, and lie, oppress, and kill in concert,--<br/>So let them die as _one!_<br/><br/>_Dag_.                  Should _one_ survive,<br/>He would be dangerous as the whole; it is not<br/>Their number, be it tens or thousands, but<br/>The spirit of this Aristocracy<br/>Which must be rooted out; and if there were<br/>A single shoot of the old tree in life,<br/>'Twould fasten in the soil, and spring again<br/>To gloomy verdure and to bitter fruit.<br/>Bertram, we must be firm!<br/><br/>_Cal_.                   Look to it well<br/>Bertram! I have an eye upon thee.<br/><br/>_Ber_.                            Who<br/>Distrusts me?<br/><br/>_Cal_.       Not I; for if I did so,<br/>Thou wouldst not now be there to talk of trust:<br/>It is thy softness, not thy want of faith,<br/>Which makes thee to be doubted.<br/><br/>_Ber_.                         You should know<br/>Who hear me, who and what I am; a man<br/>Roused like yourselves to overthrow oppression;<br/>A kind man, I am apt to think, as some<br/>Of you have found me; and if brave or no,<br/>You, Calendaro, can pronounce, who have seen me<br/>Put to the proof; or, if you should have doubts,<br/>I'll clear them on your person!<br/><br/>_Cal_.                         You are welcome,<br/>When once our enterprise is o'er, which must not<br/>Be interrupted by a private brawl.<br/><br/>_Ber_. I am no brawler; but can bear myself<br/>As far among the foe as any he<br/>Who hears me; else why have I been selected<br/>To be of your chief comrades? but no less<br/>I own my natural weakness; I have not<br/>Yet learned to think of indiscriminate murder<br/>Without some sense of shuddering; and the sight<br/>Of blood which spouts through hoary scalps is not<br/>To me a thing of triumph, nor the death<br/>Of man surprised a glory. Well--too well<br/>I know that we must do such things on those<br/>Whose acts have raised up such avengers; but<br/>If there were some of these who could be saved<br/>From out this sweeping fate, for our own sakes<br/>And for our honour, to take off some stain<br/>Of massacre, which else pollutes it wholly,<br/>I had been glad; and see no cause in this<br/>For sneer, nor for suspicion!<br/><br/>_Dag_.                       Calm thee, Bertram,<br/>For we suspect thee not, and take good heart.<br/>It is the cause, and not our will, which asks<br/>Such actions from our hands: we'll wash away<br/>All stains in Freedom's fountain!<br/><br/>      _Enter_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO, _and the_ DOGE, _disguised_.<br/><br/>_Dag_.                            Welcome, Israel.<br/><br/>_Consp_. Most welcome.--Brave Bertuccio, thou art late--<br/>Who is this stranger?<br/><br/>_Cal_.               It is time to name him.<br/>Our comrades are even now prepared to greet him<br/>In brotherhood, as I have made it known<br/>That thou wouldst add a brother to our cause,<br/>Approved by thee, and thus approved by all,<br/>Such is our trust in all thine actions. Now<br/>Let him unfold himself.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.              Stranger, step forth!<br/>                                        [_The Doge discovers himself_.<br/><br/>_Consp_. To arms!--we are betrayed--it is the Doge!<br/>Down with them both! our traitorous captain, and<br/>The tyrant he hath sold us to.<br/><br/>_Cal_. (_drawing his sword_).  Hold! hold!<br/>Who moves a step against them dies. Hold! hear<br/>Bertuccio--What! are you appalled to see<br/>A lone, unguarded, weaponless old man<br/>Amongst you?--Israel, speak! what means this mystery?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Let them advance and strike at their own bosoms,<br/>Ungrateful suicides! for on our lives<br/>Depend their own, their fortunes, and their hopes.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Strike!--If I dreaded death, a death more fearful<br/>Than any your rash weapons can inflict,<br/>I should not now be here: Oh, noble Courage!<br/>The eldest born of Fear, which makes you brave<br/>Against this solitary hoary head!<br/>See the bold chiefs, who would reform a state<br/>And shake down senates, mad with wrath and dread<br/>At sight of one patrician! Butcher me!<br/>You can, I care not.--Israel, are these men<br/>The mighty hearts you spoke of? look upon them!<br/><br/>_Cal_. Faith! he hath shamed us, and deservedly,<br/>Was this your trust in your true Chief Bertuccio,<br/>To turn your swords against him and his guest?<br/>Sheathe them, and hear him.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                   I disdain to speak.<br/>They might and must have known a heart like mine<br/>Incapable of treachery; and the power<br/>They gave me to adopt all fitting means<br/>To further their design was ne'er abused.<br/>They might be certain that who e'er was brought<br/>By me into this Council had been led<br/>To take his choice--as brother, or as victim.<br/><br/>_Doge_. And which am I to be? your actions leave<br/>Some cause to doubt the freedom of the choice.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. My Lord, we would have perished here together,<br/>Had these rash men proceeded; but, behold,<br/>They are ashamed of that mad moment's impulse,<br/>And droop their heads; believe me, they are such<br/>As I described them.--Speak to them.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                              Aye, speak;<br/>We are all listening in wonder.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. (_addressing the conspirators_). You are safe,<br/>Nay, more, almost triumphant--listen then,<br/>And know my words for truth.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                     You see me here,<br/>As one of you hath said, an old, unarmed,<br/>Defenceless man; and yesterday you saw me<br/>Presiding in the hall of ducal state,<br/>Apparent Sovereign of our hundred isles,<br/>Robed in official purple, dealing out<br/>The edicts of a power which is not mine,<br/>Nor yours, but of our masters--the patricians.<br/>Why I was there you know, or think you know;<br/>Why I am _here_, he who hath been most wronged,<br/>He who among you hath been most insulted,<br/>Outraged and trodden on, until he doubt<br/>If he be worm or no, may answer for me,<br/>Asking of his own heart what brought him here?<br/>You know my recent story, all men know it,<br/>And judge of it far differently from those<br/>Who sate in judgement to heap scorn on scorn.<br/>But spare me the recital--it is here,<br/>Here at my heart the outrage--but my words,<br/>Already spent in unavailing plaints,<br/>Would only show my feebleness the more,<br/>And I come here to strengthen even the strong,<br/>And urge them on to deeds, and not to war<br/>With woman's weapons; but I need not urge you.<br/>Our private wrongs have sprung from public vices,<br/>In this--I cannot call it commonwealth,<br/>Nor kingdom, which hath neither prince nor people,<br/>But all the sins of the old Spartan state<br/>Without its virtues--temperance and valour.<br/>The Lords of Laced√¶mon were true soldiers,<br/>But ours are Sybarites, while we are Helots,<br/>Of whom I am the lowest, most enslaved;<br/>Although dressed out to head a pageant, as<br/>The Greeks of yore made drunk their slaves to form<br/>A pastime for their children. You are met<br/>To overthrow this Monster of a state,<br/>This mockery of a Government, this spectre,<br/>Which must be exorcised with blood,--and then<br/>We will renew the times of Truth and Justice,<br/>Condensing in a fair free commonwealth<br/>Not rash equality but equal rights,<br/>Proportioned like the columns to the temple,<br/>Giving and taking strength reciprocal,<br/>And making firm the whole with grace and beauty,<br/>So that no part could be removed without<br/>Infringement of the general symmetry.<br/>In operating this great change, I claim<br/>To be one of you--if you trust in me;<br/>If not, strike home,--my life is compromised,<br/>And I would rather fall by freemen's hands<br/>Than live another day to act the tyrant<br/>As delegate of tyrants: such I am not,<br/>And never have been--read it in our annals;<br/>I can appeal to my past government<br/>In many lands and cities; they can tell you<br/>If I were an oppressor, or a man<br/>Feeling and thinking for my fellow men.<br/>Haply had I been what the Senate sought,<br/>A thing of robes and trinkets, dizened out<br/>To sit in state as for a Sovereign's picture;<br/>A popular scourge, a ready sentence-signer,<br/>A stickler for the Senate and "the Forty,"<br/>A sceptic of all measures which had not<br/>The sanction of "the Ten," a council-fawner,<br/>A tool--a fool--a puppet,--they had ne'er<br/>Fostered the wretch who stung me. What I suffer<br/>Has reached me through my pity for the people;<br/>That many know, and they who know not yet<br/>Will one day learn: meantime I do devote,<br/>Whate'er the issue, my last days of life--<br/>My present power such as it is, not that<br/>Of Doge, but of a man who has been great<br/>Before he was degraded to a Doge,<br/>And still has individual means and mind;<br/>I stake my fame (and I had fame)--my breath--<br/>(The least of all, for its last hours are nigh)<br/>My heart--my hope--my soul--upon this cast!<br/>Such as I am, I offer me to you<br/>And to your chiefs; accept me or reject me,--<br/>A Prince who fain would be a Citizen<br/>Or nothing, and who has left his throne to be so.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Long live Faliero!--Venice shall be free!<br/><br/>_Consp_. Long live Faliero!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                    Comrades! did I well?<br/>Is not this man a host in such a cause?<br/><br/>_Doge_. This is no time for eulogies, nor place<br/>For exultation. Am I one of you?<br/><br/>_Cal_. Aye, and the first among us, as thou hast been<br/>Of Venice--be our General and Chief.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Chief!--General!--I was General at Zara,<br/>And Chief in Rhodes and Cyprus, Prince in Venice:<br/>I cannot stoop--that is, I am not fit<br/>To lead a band of--patriots: when I lay<br/>Aside the dignities which I have borne,<br/>'Tis not to put on others, but to be<br/>Mate to my fellows--but now to the point:<br/>Israel has stated to me your whole plan--<br/>'Tis bold, but feasible if I assist it,<br/>And must be set in motion instantly.<br/><br/>_Cal_. E'en when thou wilt. Is it not so, my friends?<br/>I have disposed all for a sudden blow;<br/>When shall it be then?<br/><br/>_Doge_.               At sunrise.<br/><br/>_Ber_.                            So soon?<br/><br/>_Doge_. So soon?--so late--each hour accumulates<br/>Peril on peril, and the more so now<br/>Since I have mingled with you;--know you not<br/>The Council, and "the Ten?" the spies, the eyes<br/>Of the patricians dubious of their slaves,<br/>And now more dubious of the Prince they have made one?<br/>I tell you, you must strike, and suddenly,<br/>Full to the Hydra's heart--its heads will follow.<br/><br/>_Cal_. With all my soul and sword, I yield assent;<br/>Our companies are ready, sixty each,<br/>And all now under arms by Israel's order;<br/>Each at their different place of rendezvous,<br/>And vigilant, expectant of some blow;<br/>Let each repair for action to his post!<br/>And now, my Lord, the signal?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                       When you hear<br/>The great bell of Saint Mark's, which may not be<br/>Struck without special order of the Doge<br/>(The last poor privilege they leave their Prince),<br/>March on Saint Mark's!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.              And there?--<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           By different routes<br/>Let your march be directed, every sixty<br/>Entering a separate avenue, and still<br/>Upon the way let your cry be of War<br/>And of the Genoese Fleet, by the first dawn<br/>Discerned before the port; form round the palace,<br/>Within whose court will be drawn out in arms<br/>My nephew and the clients of our house,<br/>Many and martial; while the bell tolls on,<br/>Shout ye, "Saint Mark!--the foe is on our waters!"<br/><br/>_Cal_. I see it now--but on, my noble Lord.<br/><br/>_Doge_. All the patricians flocking to the Council,<br/>(Which they dare not refuse, at the dread signal<br/>Pealing from out their Patron Saint's proud tower,)<br/>Will then be gathered in unto the harvest,<br/>And we will reap them with the sword for sickle.<br/>If some few should be tardy or absent, them,<br/>'Twill be but to be taken faint and single,<br/>When the majority are put to rest.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Would that the hour were come! we will not scotch,<br/>But kill.<br/><br/>_Ber_.     Once more, sir, with your pardon, I<br/>Would now repeat the question which I asked<br/>Before Bertuccio added to our cause<br/>This great ally who renders it more sure,<br/>And therefore safer, and as such admits<br/>Some dawn of mercy to a portion of<br/>Our victims--must all perish in this slaughter?<br/><br/>_Cal_. All who encounter me and mine--be sure,<br/>The mercy they have shown, I show.<br/><br/>_Consp_.                            All! all!<br/>Is this a time to talk of pity? when<br/>Have they e'er shown, or felt, or feigned it?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                    Bertram,<br/>This false compassion is a folly, and<br/>Injustice to thy comrades and thy cause!<br/>Dost thou not see, that if we single out<br/>Some for escape, they live but to avenge<br/>The fallen? and how distinguish now the innocent<br/>From out the guilty? all their acts are one--<br/>A single emanation from one body,<br/>Together knit for our oppression! 'Tis<br/>Much that we let their children live; I doubt<br/>If all of these even should be set apart:<br/>The hunter may reserve some single cub<br/>From out the tiger's litter, but who e'er<br/>Would seek to save the spotted sire or dam,<br/>Unless to perish by their fangs? however,<br/>I will abide by Doge Faliero's counsel:<br/>Let him decide if any should be saved.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Ask me not--tempt me not with such a question--<br/>Decide yourselves.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.           You know their private virtues<br/>Far better than we can, to whom alone<br/>Their public vices, and most foul oppression,<br/>Have made them deadly; if there be amongst them<br/>One who deserves to be repealed, pronounce.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Dolfino's father was my friend, and Lando<br/>Fought by my side, and Marc Cornaro shared<br/>My Genoese embassy: I saved the life<br/>Of Veniero--shall I save it twice?<br/>Would that I could save them and Venice also!<br/>All these men, or their fathers, were my friends<br/>Till they became my subjects; then fell from me<br/>As faithless leaves drop from the o'erblown flower,<br/>And left me a lone blighted thorny stalk,<br/>Which, in its solitude, can shelter nothing;<br/>So, as they let me wither, let them perish!<br/><br/>_Cal_. They cannot co-exist with Venice' freedom!<br/><br/>_Doge_. Ye, though you know and feel our mutual mass<br/>Of many wrongs, even ye are ignorant<br/>What fatal poison to the springs of Life,<br/>To human ties, and all that's good and dear,<br/>Lurks in the present institutes of Venice:<br/>All these men were my friends; I loved them, they<br/>Requited honourably my regards;<br/>We served and fought; we smiled and wept in concert;<br/>We revelled or we sorrowed side by side;<br/>We made alliances of blood and marriage;<br/>We grew in years and honours fairly,--till<br/>Their own desire, not my ambition, made<br/>Them choose me for their Prince, and then farewell!<br/>Farewell all social memory! all thoughts<br/>In common! and sweet bonds which link old friendships,<br/>When the survivors of long years and actions,<br/>Which now belong to history, soothe the days<br/>Which yet remain by treasuring each other,<br/>And never meet, but each beholds the mirror<br/>Of half a century on his brother's brow,<br/>And sees a hundred beings, now in earth,<br/>Flit round them whispering of the days gone by,<br/>And seeming not all dead, as long as two<br/>Of the brave, joyous, reckless, glorious band,<br/>Which once were one and many, still retain<br/>A breath to sigh for them, a tongue to speak<br/>Of deeds that else were silent, save on marble----<br/>_Oim√© Oim√©!_--and must I do this deed?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. My Lord, you are much moved: it is not now<br/>That such things must be dwelt upon.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                              Your patience<br/>A moment--I recede not: mark with me<br/>The gloomy vices of this government.<br/>From the hour they made me Doge, the _Doge_ they _made_ me--<br/>Farewell the past! I died to all that had been,<br/>Or rather they to me: no friends, no kindness,<br/>No privacy of life--all were cut off:<br/>They came not near me--such approach gave umbrage;<br/>They could not love me--such was not the law;<br/>They thwarted me--'twas the state's policy;<br/>They baffled me--'twas a patrician's duty;<br/>They wronged me, for such was to right the state;<br/>They could not right me--that would give suspicion;<br/>So that I was a slave to my own subjects;<br/>So that I was a foe to my own friends;<br/>Begirt with spies for guards, with robes for power,<br/>With pomp for freedom, gaolers for a council,<br/>Inquisitors for friends, and Hell for life!<br/>I had only one fount of quiet left,<br/>And _that_ they poisoned! My pure household gods<br/>Were shivered on my hearth, and o'er their shrine<br/>Sate grinning Ribaldry, and sneering Scorn.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. You have been deeply wronged, and now shall be<br/>Nobly avenged before another night.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I had borne all--it hurt me, but I bore it--<br/>Till this last running over of the cup<br/>Of bitterness--until this last loud insult,<br/>Not only unredressed, but sanctioned; then,<br/>And thus, I cast all further feelings from me--<br/>The feelings which they crushed for me, long, long<br/>Before, even in their oath of false allegiance!<br/>Even in that very hour and vow, they abjured<br/>Their friend and made a Sovereign, as boys make<br/>_Playthings_, to do their pleasure--and be broken!<br/>I from that hour have seen but Senators<br/>In dark suspicious conflict with the Doge,<br/>Brooding with him in mutual hate and fear;<br/>They dreading he should snatch the tyranny<br/>From out their grasp, and he abhorring tyrants.<br/>To me, then, these men have no _private_ life,<br/>Nor claim to ties they have cut off from others;<br/>As Senators for arbitrary acts<br/>Amenable, I look on them--as such<br/>Let them be dealt upon.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                  And now to action!<br/>Hence, brethren, to our posts, and may this be<br/>The last night of mere words: I'd fain be doing!<br/>Saint Mark's great bell at dawn shall find me wakeful!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Disperse then to your posts: be firm and vigilant;<br/>Think on the wrongs we bear, the rights we claim.<br/>This day and night shall be the last of peril!<br/>Watch for the signal, and then march. I go<br/>To join my band; let each be prompt to marshal<br/>His separate charge: the Doge will now return<br/>To the palace to prepare all for the blow.<br/>We part to meet in Freedom and in Glory!<br/><br/>_Cal_. Doge, when I greet you next, my homage to you<br/>Shall be the head of Steno on this sword!<br/><br/>_Doge_. No; let him be reserved unto the last,<br/>Nor turn aside to strike at such a prey,<br/>Till nobler game is quarried: his offence<br/>Was a mere ebullition of the vice,<br/>The general corruption generated<br/>By the foul Aristocracy: he could not--<br/>He dared not in more honourable days<br/>Have risked it. I have merged all private wrath<br/>Against him in the thought of our great purpose.<br/>A slave insults me--I require his punishment<br/>From his proud master's hands; if he refuse it,<br/>The offence grows his, and let him answer it.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Yet, as the immediate cause of the alliance<br/>Which consecrates our undertaking more,<br/>I owe him such deep gratitude, that fain<br/>I would repay him as he merits; may I?<br/><br/>_Doge_. You would but lop the hand, and I the head;<br/>You would but smite the scholar, I the master;<br/>You would but punish Steno, I the Senate.<br/>I cannot pause on individual hate,<br/>In the absorbing, sweeping, whole revenge,<br/>Which, like the sheeted fire from Heaven, must blast<br/>Without distinction, as it fell of yore,<br/>Where the Dead Sea hath quenched two Cities' ashes.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Away, then, to your posts! I but remain<br/>A moment to accompany the Doge<br/>To our late place of tryst, to see no spies<br/>Have been upon the scout, and thence I hasten<br/>To where my allotted band is under arms.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Farewell, then,--until dawn!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                           Success go with you!<br/><br/>_Consp_. We will not fail--Away! My Lord, farewell!<br/><br/>           [_The Conspirators salute the_ DOGE _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO,<br/>            _and retire, headed by_ PHILIP CALENDARO. _The_ DOGE _and_<br/>                                            ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _remain_.<br/><br/>_I.

And is it then decided! must they die?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Who?<br/><br/>_Doge_.        My own friends by blood and courtesy,<br/>And many deeds and days--the Senators?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. You passed their sentence, and it is a just one.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Aye, so it seems, and so it is to _you_;<br/>You are a patriot, a plebeian Gracchus--<br/>The rebel's oracle, the people's tribune--<br/>I blame you not--you act in your vocation;<br/>They smote you, and oppressed you, and despised you;<br/>So they have _me_: but _you_ ne'er spake with them;<br/>You never broke their bread, nor shared their salt;<br/>You never had their wine-cup at your lips:<br/>You grew not up with them, nor laughed, nor wept,<br/>Nor held a revel in their company;<br/>Ne'er smiled to see them smile, nor claimed their smile<br/>In social interchange for yours, nor trusted<br/>Nor wore them in your heart of hearts, as I have:<br/>These hairs of mine are grey, and so are theirs,<br/>The elders of the Council: I remember<br/>When all our locks were like the raven's wing,<br/>As we went forth to take our prey around<br/>The isles wrung from the false Mahometan;<br/>And can I see them dabbled o'er with blood?<br/>Each stab to them will seem my suicide.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Doge! Doge! this vacillation is unworthy<br/>A child; if you are not in second childhood,<br/>Call back your nerves to your own purpose, nor<br/>Thus shame yourself and me. By Heavens! I'd rather<br/>Forego even now, or fail in our intent,<br/>Than see the man I venerate subside<br/>From high resolves into such shallow weakness!<br/>You have seen blood in battle, shed it, both<br/>Your own and that of others; can you shrink then<br/>From a few drops from veins of hoary vampires,<br/>Who but give back what they have drained from millions?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Bear with me! Step by step, and blow on blow,<br/>I will divide with you; think not I waver:<br/>Ah! no; it is the _certainty_ of all<br/>Which I must do doth make me tremble thus.<br/>But let these last and lingering thoughts have way,<br/>To which you only and the night are conscious,<br/>And both regardless; when the Hour arrives,<br/>'Tis mine to sound the knell, and strike the blow,<br/>Which shall unpeople many palaces,<br/>And hew the highest genealogic trees<br/>Down to the earth, strewed with their bleeding fruit,<br/>And crush their blossoms into barrenness:<br/>_This will_ I--must I--have I sworn to do,<br/>Nor aught can turn me from my destiny;<br/>But still I quiver to behold what I<br/>Must be, and think what I have been! Bear with me.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Re-man your breast; I feel no such remorse,<br/>I understand it not: why should you change?<br/>You acted, and you act, on your free will.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Aye, there it is--_you_ feel not, nor do I,<br/>Else I should stab thee on the spot, to save<br/>A thousand lives--and killing, do no murder;<br/>You _feel_ not--you go to this butcher-work<br/>As if these high-born men were steers for shambles:<br/>When all is over, you'll be free and merry,<br/>And calmly wash those hands incarnadine;<br/>But I, outgoing thee and all thy fellows<br/>In this surpassing massacre, shall be,<br/>Shall see and feel--oh God! oh God! 'tis true,<br/>And thou dost well to answer that it was<br/>"My own free will and act," and yet you err,<br/>For I will do this! Doubt not--fear not; I<br/>Will be your most unmerciful accomplice!<br/>And yet I act no more on my free will,<br/>Nor my own feelings--both compel me back;<br/>But there is _Hell_ within me and around,<br/>And like the Demon who believes and trembles<br/>Must I abhor and do.

With all my soul!<br/>Keep a firm rein upon these bursts of passion;<br/>Remember what these men have dealt to thee,<br/>And that this sacrifice will be succeeded<br/>By ages of prosperity and freedom<br/>To this unshackled city: a true tyrant<br/>Would have depopulated empires, nor<br/>Have felt the strange compunction which hath wrung you<br/>To punish a few traitors to the people.<br/>Trust me, such were a pity more misplaced<br/>Than the late mercy of the state to Steno.<br/><br/>_Doge_.

Nor now, nor ever; whatsoe'er betide,<br/>I would have saved you: when to Manhood's growth<br/>We sprung, and you, devoted to the state,<br/>As suits your station, the more humble Bertram<br/>Was left unto the labours of the humble,<br/>Still you forsook me not; and if my fortunes<br/>Have not been towering, 'twas no fault of him<br/>Who ofttimes rescued and supported me,<br/>When struggling with the tides of Circumstance,<br/>Which bear away the weaker: noble blood<br/>Ne'er mantled in a nobler heart than thine<br/>Has proved to me, the poor plebeian Bertram.<br/>Would that thy fellow Senators were like thee!<br/><br/>_Lioni_. Why, what hast thou to say against the Senate?<br/><br/>_Ber_. Nothing.<br/><br/>_Lioni_.        I know that there are angry spirits<br/>And turbulent mutterers of stifled treason,<br/>Who lurk in narrow places, and walk out<br/>Muffled to whisper curses to the night;<br/>Disbanded soldiers, discontented ruffians,<br/>And desperate libertines who brawl in taverns;<br/>_Thou_ herdest not with such: 'tis true, of late<br/>I have lost sight of thee, but thou wert wont<br/>To lead a temperate life, and break thy bread<br/>With honest mates, and bear a cheerful aspect.<br/>What hath come to thee? in thy hollow eye<br/>And hueless cheek, and thine unquiet motions,<br/>Sorrow and Shame and Conscience seem at war<br/>To waste thee.<br/><br/>_Ber_.         Rather Shame and Sorrow light<br/>On the accurs√©d tyranny which rides<br/>The very air in Venice, and makes men<br/>Madden as in the last hours of the plague<br/>Which sweeps the soul deliriously from life!<br/><br/>_Lioni_. Some villains have been tampering with thee, Bertram;<br/>This is not thy old language, nor own thoughts;<br/>Some wretch has made thee drunk with disaffection:<br/>But thou must not be lost so; thou _wert_ good<br/>And kind, and art not fit for such base acts<br/>As Vice and Villany would put thee to:<br/>Confess--confide in me--thou know'st my nature.<br/>What is it thou and thine are bound to do,<br/>Which should prevent thy friend, the only son<br/>Of him who was a friend unto thy father,<br/>So that our good-will is a heritage<br/>We should bequeath to our posterity<br/>Such as ourselves received it, or augmented;<br/>I say, what is it thou must do, that I<br/>Should deem thee dangerous, and keep the house<br/>Like a sick girl?<br/><br/>_Ber_.           Nay, question me no further:<br/>I must be gone.----<br/><br/>_Lioni_.           And I be murdered!--say,<br/>Was it not thus thou said'st, my gentle Bertram?<br/><br/>_Ber_. Who talks of murder? what said I of murder?<br/>Tis false! I did not utter such a word.<br/><br/>_Lioni_. Thou didst not; but from out thy wolfish eye,<br/>So changed from what I knew it, there glares forth<br/>The gladiator. If _my_ life's thine object,<br/>Take it--I am unarmed,--and then away!<br/>I would not hold my breath on such a tenure<br/>As the capricious mercy of such things<br/>As thou and those who have set thee to thy task-work.<br/><br/>_Ber_. Sooner than spill thy blood, I peril mine;<br/>Sooner than harm a hair of thine, I place<br/>In jeopardy a thousand heads, and some<br/>As noble, nay, even nobler than thine own.<br/><br/>_Lioni_. Aye, is it even so? Excuse me, Bertram;<br/>I am not worthy to be singled out<br/>From such exalted hecatombs--who are they<br/>That _are_ in danger, and that _make_ the danger?<br/><br/>_Ber_. Venice, and all that she inherits, are<br/>Divided like a house against itself,<br/>And so will perish ere to-morrow's twilight!<br/><br/>_Lioni_. More mysteries, and awful ones! But now,<br/>Or thou, or I, or both, it may be, are<br/>Upon the verge of ruin; speak once out,<br/>And thou art safe and glorious: for 'tis more<br/>Glorious to save than slay, and slay i' the dark too--<br/>Fie, Bertram! that was not a craft for thee!<br/>How would it look to see upon a spear<br/>The head of him whose heart was open to thee!<br/>Borne by thy hand before the shuddering people?<br/>And such may be my doom; for here I swear,<br/>Whate'er the peril or the penalty<br/>Of thy denunciation, I go forth,<br/>Unless thou dost detail the cause, and show<br/>The consequence of all which led thee here!<br/><br/>_Ber_. Is there no way to save thee? minutes fly,<br/>And thou art lost!--_thou_! my sole benefactor,<br/>The only being who was constant to me<br/>Through every change. Yet, make me not a traitor!<br/>Let me save thee--but spare my honour!<br/><br/>_Lioni_.                              Where<br/>Can lie the honour in a league of murder?<br/>And who are traitors save unto the State?<br/><br/>_Ber_. A league is still a compact, and more binding<br/>In honest hearts when words must stand for law;<br/>And in my mind, there is no traitor like<br/>He whose domestic treason plants the poniard<br/>Within the breast which trusted to his truth.<br/>Lioni. And who will strike the steel to mine?<br/><br/>_Ber_.                                       Not I;<br/>I could have wound my soul up to all things<br/>Save this. _Thou_ must not die! and think how dear<br/>Thy life is, when I risk so many lives,<br/>Nay, more, the Life of lives, the liberty<br/>Of future generations, _not_ to be<br/>The assassin thou miscall'st me:--once, once more<br/>I do adjure thee, pass not o'er thy threshold!<br/><br/>_Lioni_. It is in vain--this moment I go forth.<br/><br/>_Ber_. Then perish Venice rather than my friend!<br/>I will disclose--ensnare--betray--destroy--<br/>Oh, what a villain I become for thee!<br/><br/>_Lioni_. Say, rather thy friend's saviour and the State's!--<br/>Speak--pause not--all rewards, all pledges for<br/>Thy safety and thy welfare; wealth such as<br/>The State accords her worthiest servants; nay,<br/>Nobility itself I guarantee thee,<br/>So that thou art sincere and penitent.<br/><br/>_Ber_. I have thought again: it must not be--I love thee--<br/>Thou knowest it--that I stand here is the proof,<br/>Not least though last; but having done my duty<br/>By thee, I now must do it by my country!<br/>Farewell--we meet no more in life!--farewell!<br/><br/>_Lioni_. What, ho!--Antonio--Pedro--to the door!<br/>See that none pass--arrest this man!----<br/><br/> _Enter_ ANTONIO _and other armed Domestics, who seize_ BERTRAM.<br/><br/>_Lioni_ (_continues_).              Take care<br/>He hath no harm; bring me my sword and cloak,<br/>And man the gondola with four oars--quick--<br/>                                                      [_Exit_ ANTONIO.<br/>We will unto Giovanni Gradenigo's,<br/>And send for Marc Cornaro:--fear not, Bertram;<br/>This needful violence is for thy safety,<br/>No less than for the general weal.<br/><br/>_Ber_.                            Where wouldst thou<br/>Bear me a prisoner?<br/><br/>_Lioni_.             Firstly to "the Ten;"<br/>Next to the Doge.<br/><br/>_Ber_.           To the Doge?<br/><br/>_Lioni_.                           Assuredly:<br/>Is he not Chief of the State?<br/><br/>_Ber_.                        Perhaps at sunrise--<br/><br/>_Lioni_. What mean you?--but we'll know anon.<br/><br/>_Ber_.                                       Art sure?<br/><br/>_Lioni_. Sure as all gentle means can make; and if<br/>They fail, you know "the Ten" and their tribunal,<br/>And that St. Mark's has dungeons, and the dungeons<br/>A rack.<br/><br/>_Ber_.  Apply it then before the dawn<br/>Now hastening into heaven.--One more such word,<br/>And you shall perish piecemeal, by the death<br/>You think to doom to me.<br/><br/>                       _Re-enter_ ANTONIO.<br/><br/>_Ant_.                    The bark is ready,<br/>My Lord, and all prepared.<br/><br/>_Lioni_.                  Look to the prisoner.<br/>Bertram, I'll reason with thee as we go<br/>To the Magnifico's, sage Gradenigo.                         [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_The Ducal Palace_--_The Doge's Apartment_.<br/><br/>          _The_ DOGE _and his Nephew_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Are all the people of our house in muster?<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ They are arrayed, and eager for the signal,<br/>Within our palace precincts at San Polo:<br/>I come for your last orders.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                     It had been<br/>As well had there been time to have got together,<br/>From my own fief, Val di Marino, more<br/>Of our retainers--but it is too late.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Methinks, my Lord,'tis better as it is:<br/>A sudden swelling of our retinue<br/>Had waked suspicion; and, though fierce and trusty,<br/>The vassals of that district are too rude<br/>And quick in quarrel to have long maintained<br/>The secret discipline we need for such<br/>A service, till our foes are dealt upon.<br/><br/>_Doge_. True; but when once the signal has been given,<br/>_These_ are the men for such an enterprise;<br/>These city slaves have all their private bias,<br/>Their prejudice _against_ or _for_ this noble,<br/>Which may induce them to o'erdo or spare<br/>Where mercy may be madness; the fierce peasants,<br/>Serfs of my county of Val di Marino,<br/>Would do the bidding of their lord without<br/>Distinguishing for love or hate his foes;<br/>Alike to them Marcello or Cornaro,<br/>A Gradenigo or a Foscari;<br/>They are not used to start at those vain names,<br/>Nor bow the knee before a civic Senate;<br/>A chief in armour is their Suzerain,<br/>And not a thing in robes.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                We are enough;<br/>And for the dispositions of our clients<br/>Against the Senate I will answer.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                          Well,<br/>The die is thrown; but for a warlike service,<br/>Done in the field, commend me to my peasants:<br/>They made the sun shine through the host of Huns<br/>When sallow burghers slunk back to their tents,<br/>And cowered to hear their own victorious trumpet.<br/>If there be small resistance, you will find<br/>These Citizens all Lions, like their Standard;<br/>But if there's much to do, you'll wish, with me,<br/>A band of iron rustics at our backs.<br/><br/>_Ber_. Thus thinking, I must marvel you resolve<br/>To strike the blow so suddenly.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                        Such blows<br/>Must be struck suddenly or never. When<br/>I had o'ermastered the weak false remorse<br/>Which yearned about my heart, too fondly yielding<br/>A moment to the feelings of old days,<br/>I was most fain to strike; and, firstly, that<br/>I might not yield again to such emotions;<br/>And, secondly, because of all these men,<br/>Save Israel and Philip Calendaro,<br/>I know not well the courage or the faith:<br/>To-day might find 'mongst them a traitor to us,<br/>As yesterday a thousand to the Senate;<br/>But once in, with their hilts hot in their hands,<br/>They must _on_ for their own sakes; one stroke struck,<br/>And the mere instinct of the first-born Cain,<br/>Which ever lurks somewhere in human hearts,<br/>Though Circumstance may keep it in abeyance,<br/>Will urge the rest on like to wolves; the sight<br/>Of blood to crowds begets the thirst of more,<br/>As the first wine-cup leads to the long revel;<br/>And you will find a harder task to quell<br/>Than urge them when they _have_ commenced, but _till_<br/>That moment, a mere voice, a straw, a shadow,<br/>Are capable of turning them aside.--<br/>How goes the night?<br/><br/>_Ber. F._          Almost upon the dawn.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Then it is time to strike upon the bell.<br/>Are the men posted?<br/><br/>_Ber. F._          By this time they are;<br/>But they have orders not to strike, until<br/>They have command from you through me in person.<br/><br/>_Doge_. 'Tis well.--Will the morn never put to rest<br/>These stars which twinkle yet o'er all the heavens?<br/>I am settled and bound up, and being so,<br/>The very effort which it cost me to<br/>Resolve to cleanse this Commonwealth with fire,<br/>Now leaves my mind more steady. I have wept,<br/>And trembled at the thought of this dread duty;<br/>But now I have put down all idle passion,<br/>And look the growing tempest in the face,<br/>As doth the pilot of an Admiral Galley:<br/>Yet (wouldst thou think it, kinsman?) it hath been<br/>A greater struggle to me, than when nations<br/>Beheld their fate merged in the approaching fight,<br/>Where I was leader of a phalanx, where<br/>Thousands were sure to perish--Yes, to spill<br/>The rank polluted current from the veins<br/>Of a few bloated despots needed more<br/>To steel me to a purpose such as made<br/>Timoleon immortal, than to face<br/>The toils and dangers of a life of war.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ It gladdens me to see your former wisdom<br/>Subdue the furies which so wrung you ere<br/>You were decided.<br/><br/>_Doge_.          It was ever thus<br/>With me; the hour of agitation came<br/>In the first glimmerings of a purpose, when<br/>Passion had too much room to sway; but in<br/>The hour of action I have stood as calm<br/>As were the dead who lay around me: this<br/>They knew who made me what I am, and trusted<br/>To the subduing power which I preserved<br/>Over my mood, when its first burst was spent.<br/>But they were not aware that there are things<br/>Which make revenge a virtue by reflection,<br/>And not an impulse of mere anger; though<br/>The laws sleep, Justice wakes, and injured souls<br/>Oft do a public right with private wrong,<br/>And justify their deeds unto themselves.--<br/>Methinks the day breaks--is it not so? look,<br/>Thine eyes are clear with youth;--the air puts on<br/>A morning freshness, and, at least to me,<br/>The sea looks greyer through the lattice.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._                                True,<br/>The morn is dappling in the sky.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                               Away then!<br/>See that they strike without delay, and with<br/>The first toll from St. Mark's, march on the palace<br/>With all our House's strength; here I will meet you;<br/>The Sixteen and their companies will move<br/>In separate columns at the self-same moment:<br/>Be sure you post yourself at the great Gate:<br/>I would not trust "the Ten" except to us--<br/>The rest, the rabble of patricians, may<br/>Glut the more careless swords of those leagued with us.<br/>Remember that the cry is still "Saint Mark!<br/>The Genoese are come--ho! to the rescue!<br/>Saint Mark and Liberty!"--Now--now to action!<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Farewell then, noble Uncle! we will meet<br/>In freedom and true sovereignty, or never!<br/><br/>_Doge_. Come hither, my Bertuccio--one embrace;<br/>Speed, for the day grows broader; send me soon<br/>A messenger to tell me how all goes<br/>When you rejoin our troops, and then sound--sound<br/>The storm-bell from St. Mark's!<br/>                                            [_Exit_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_solus_).                 He is gone,<br/>And on each footstep moves a life. 'Tis done.<br/>Now the destroying Angel hovers o'er<br/>Venice, and pauses ere he pours the vial,<br/>Even as the eagle overlooks his prey,<br/>And for a moment, poised in middle air,<br/>Suspends the motion of his mighty wings,<br/>Then swoops with his unerring beak. Thou Day!<br/>That slowly walk'st the waters! march--march on--<br/>I would not smite i' the dark, but rather see<br/>That no stroke errs. And you, ye blue sea waves!<br/>I have seen you dyed ere now, and deeply too,<br/>With Genoese, Saracen, and Hunnish gore,<br/>While that of Venice flowed too, but victorious:<br/>Now thou must wear an unmixed crimson; no<br/>Barbaric blood can reconcile us now<br/>Unto that horrible incarnadine,<br/>But friend or foe will roll in civic slaughter.<br/>And have I lived to fourscore years for this?<br/>I, who was named Preserver of the City?<br/>I, at whose name the million's caps were flung<br/>Into the air, and cries from tens of thousands<br/>Rose up, imploring Heaven to send me blessings,<br/>And fame, and length of days--to see this day?<br/>But this day, black within the calendar,<br/>Shall be succeeded by a bright millennium.<br/>Doge Dandolo survived to ninety summers<br/>To vanquish empires, and refuse their crown;<br/>I will resign a crown, and make the State<br/>Renew its freedom--but oh! by what means?<br/>The noble end must justify them. What<br/>Are a few drops of human blood? 'tis false,<br/>The blood of tyrants is not human; they,<br/>Like to incarnate Molochs, feed on ours,<br/>Until 'tis time to give them to the tombs<br/>Which they have made so populous.--Oh World!<br/>Oh Men! what are ye, and our best designs,<br/>That we must work by crime to punish crime?<br/>And slay as if Death had but this one gate,<br/>When a few years would make the sword superfluous?<br/>And I, upon the verge of th' unknown realm,<br/>Yet send so many heralds on before me?--<br/>I must not ponder this.                                    [_A pause._<br/>                         Hark! was there not<br/>A murmur as of distant voices, and<br/>The tramp of feet in martial unison?<br/>What phantoms even of sound our wishes raise!<br/>It cannot be--the signal hath not rung--<br/>Why pauses it? My nephew's messenger<br/>Should be upon his way to me, and he<br/>Himself perhaps even now draws grating back<br/>Upon its ponderous hinge the steep tower portal,<br/>Where swings the sullen huge oracular bell,<br/>Which never knells but for a princely death,<br/>Or for a state in peril, pealing forth<br/>Tremendous bodements; let it do its office,<br/>And be this peal its awfullest and last<br/>Sound till the strong tower rock!--What! silent still?<br/>I would go forth, but that my post is here,<br/>To be the centre of re-union to<br/>The oft discordant elements which form<br/>Leagues of this nature, and to keep compact<br/>The wavering of the weak, in case of conflict;<br/>For if they should do battle,'twill be here,<br/>Within the palace, that the strife will thicken:<br/>Then here must be my station, as becomes<br/>The master-mover.--Hark! he comes--he comes,<br/>My nephew, brave Bertuccio's messenger.--<br/>What tidings? Is he marching? hath he sped?<br/>_They_ here!-all's lost-yet will I make an effort.<br/><br/>  _Enter a_ SIGNOR OF THE NIGHT, _with Guards, etc., etc._<br/><br/>_Sig_. Doge, I arrest thee of high treason!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                     Me!<br/>Thy Prince, of treason?--Who are they that dare<br/>Cloak their own treason under such an order?<br/><br/>_Sig_. (_showing his order_).<br/>Behold my order from the assembled Ten.<br/><br/>_Doge_. And _where_ are they, and _why_ assembled? no<br/>Such Council can be lawful, till the Prince<br/>Preside there, and that duty's mine: on thine<br/>I charge thee, give me way, or marshal me<br/>To the Council chamber.<br/><br/>_Sig_.                 Duke! it may not be:<br/>Nor are they in the wonted Hall of Council,<br/>But sitting in the convent of Saint Saviour's.<br/><br/>_Doge_. You dare to disobey me, then?<br/><br/>_Sig_.                                I serve<br/>The State, and needs must serve it faithfully;<br/>My warrant is the will of those who rule it.<br/><br/>_Doge_. And till that warrant has my signature<br/>It is illegal, and, as _now_ applied,<br/>Rebellious.

'Tis not my office to reply, but act--<br/>I am placed here as guard upon thy person,<br/>And not as judge to hear or to decide.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_aside_).<br/>I must gain time. So that the storm-bell sound,<br/>All may be well yet. Kinsman, speed--speed--speed!--<br/>Our fate is trembling in the balance, and<br/>Woe to the vanquished! be they Prince and people,<br/>Or slaves and Senate--<br/>                                [_The great bell of St. Mark's tolls._<br/>                      Lo! it sounds--it tolls!<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_aloud_).<br/>Hark, Signor of the Night! and you, ye hirelings,<br/>Who wield your mercenary staves in fear,<br/>It is your knell.--Swell on, thou lusty peal!<br/>Now, knaves, what ransom for your lives?<br/><br/>_Sig_.

I did not mean to fail in the respect<br/>Due to your rank: in this I shall obey you.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_aside_). There now is nothing left me save to die;<br/>And yet how near success!

We took him in the act<br/>Of issuing from the tower, where, at his order,<br/>As delegated from the Doge, the signal<br/>Had thus begun to sound.<br/><br/>_1st Sig_.

F._ Uncle!<br/><br/>_Doge_.           It is in vain to war with Fortune;<br/>The glory hath departed from our house.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ Who would have deemed it?--Ah! one moment sooner!<br/><br/>_Doge_. That moment would have changed the face of ages;<br/>_This_ gives us to Eternity--We'll meet it<br/>As men whose triumph is not in success,<br/>But who can make their own minds all in all,<br/>Equal to every fortune. Droop not,'tis<br/>But a brief passage--I would go alone,<br/>Yet if they send us, as 'tis like, together,<br/>Let us go worthy of our sires and selves.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ I shall not shame you, Uncle.<br/><br/>_1st Sig_.                             Lords, our orders<br/>Are to keep guard on both in separate chambers,<br/>Until the Council call ye to your trial.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Our trial! will they keep their mockery up<br/>Even to the last? but let them deal upon us,<br/>As we had dealt on them, but with less pomp.<br/>'Tis but a game of mutual homicides,<br/>Who have cast lots for the first death, and they<br/>Have won with false dice.--Who hath been our Judas?<br/><br/>_1st Sig_. I am not warranted to answer that.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._ I'll answer for thee--'tis a certain Bertram,<br/>Even now deposing to the secret Giunta.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Bertram, the Bergamask! With what vile tools<br/>We operate to slay or save! This creature,<br/>Black with a double treason, now will earn<br/>Rewards and honours, and be stamped in story<br/>With the geese in the Capitol, which gabbled<br/>Till Rome awoke, and had an annual triumph,<br/>While Manlius, who hurled down the Gauls, was cast<br/>From the Tarpeian.<br/><br/>_1st Sig_.          He aspired to treason,<br/>And sought to rule the State.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                       He saved the State,<br/>And sought but to reform what he revived--<br/>But this is idle--Come, sirs, do your work.<br/><br/>_1st Sig_. Noble Bertuccio, we must now remove you<br/>Into an inner chamber.<br/><br/>_Ber. F._               Farewell, Uncle!<br/>If we shall meet again in life I know not,<br/>But they perhaps will let our ashes mingle.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Yes, and our spirits, which shall yet go forth,<br/>And do what our frail clay, thus clogged, hath failed in!<br/>They cannot quench the memory of those<br/>Who would have hurled them from their guilty thrones,<br/>And such examples will find heirs, though distant.<br/><br/>ACT V.<br/><br/>SCENE 1.--_The Hall of the Council of Ten assembled with the additional<br/>   Senators, who, on the Trials of the Conspirators for the Treason of_<br/> MARINO FALIERO, _composed what was called the Giunta,--Guards, Officers,<br/>   etc., etc._ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO _as Prisoners_.<br/>              BERTRAM, LIONI, _and Witnesses, etc._<br/><br/>           _The Chief of the Ten_, BENINTENDE.<br/><br/>_Ben_. There now rests, after such conviction of<br/>Their manifold and manifest offences,<br/>But to pronounce on these obdurate men<br/>The sentence of the Law:--a grievous task<br/>To those who hear, and those who speak. Alas!<br/>That it should fall to me! and that my days<br/>Of office should be stigmatised through all<br/>The years of coming time, as bearing record<br/>To this most foul and complicated treason<br/>Against a just and free state, known to all<br/>The earth as being the Christian bulwark 'gainst<br/>The Saracen and the schismatic Greek,<br/>The savage Hun, and not less barbarous Frank;<br/>A City which has opened India's wealth<br/>To Europe; the last Roman refuge from<br/>O'erwhelming Attila; the Ocean's Queen;<br/>Proud Genoa's prouder rival! 'Tis to sap<br/>The throne of such a City, these lost men<br/>Have risked and forfeited their worthless lives--<br/>So let them die the death.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                  We are prepared;<br/>Your racks have done that for us. Let us die.<br/><br/>_Ben_. If ye have that to say which would obtain<br/>Abatement of your punishment, the Giunta<br/>Will hear you; if you have aught to confess,<br/>Now is your time,--perhaps it may avail ye.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. We stand to hear, and not to speak.<br/><br/>_Ben_.                                       Your crimes<br/>Are fully proved by your accomplices,<br/>And all which Circumstance can add to aid them;<br/>Yet we would hear from your own lips complete<br/>Avowal of your treason: on the verge<br/>Of that dread gulf which none repass, the truth<br/>Alone can profit you on earth or Heaven--<br/>Say, then, what was your motive?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                         Justice!<br/><br/>_Ben_.                                      What<br/>Your object?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.   Freedom!<br/><br/>_Ben_.              You are brief, sir.<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. So my life grows: I<br/>Was bred a soldier, not a senator.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Perhaps you think by this blunt brevity<br/>To brave your judges to postpone the sentence?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Do you be brief as I am, and believe me,<br/>I shall prefer that mercy to your pardon.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Is this your sole reply to the Tribunal?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Go, ask your racks what they have wrung from us,<br/>Or place us there again; we have still some blood left,<br/>And some slight sense of pain in these wrenched limbs:<br/>But this ye dare not do; for if we die there--<br/>And you have left us little life to spend<br/>Upon your engines, gorged with pangs already--<br/>Ye lose the public spectacle, with which<br/>You would appal your slaves to further slavery!<br/>Groans are not words, nor agony assent,<br/>Nor affirmation Truth, if Nature's sense<br/>Should overcome the soul into a lie,<br/>For a short respite--must we bear or die?<br/><br/>_Ben_. Say, who were your accomplices?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                              The Senate.<br/><br/>_Ben_. What do you mean?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                 Ask of the suffering people,<br/>Whom your patrician crimes have driven to crime.<br/><br/>_Ben_. You know the Doge?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                  I served with him at Zara<br/>In the field, when _you_ were pleading here your way<br/>To present office; we exposed our lives,<br/>While you but hazarded the lives of others,<br/>Alike by accusation or defence;<br/>And for the rest, all Venice knows her Doge,<br/>Through his great actions, and the Senate's insults.<br/><br/>_Ben_. You have held conference with him?<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                                I am weary--<br/>Even wearier of your questions than your tortures:<br/>I pray you pass to judgment.<br/><br/>_Ben_.                         It is coming.<br/>And you, too, Philip Calendaro, what<br/>Have you to say why you should not be doomed?<br/><br/>_Cal_. I never was a man of many words,<br/>And now have few left worth the utterance.<br/><br/>_Ben_. A further application of yon engine<br/>May change your tone.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                 Most true, it _will_ do so;<br/>A former application did so; but<br/>It will not change my words, or, if it did--<br/><br/>_Ben_. What then?<br/><br/>_Cal_.             Will my avowal on yon rack<br/>Stand good in law?<br/><br/>_Ben_.             Assuredly.<br/><br/>_Cal_.                          Whoe'er<br/>The culprit be whom I accuse of treason?<br/><br/>_Ben_. Without doubt, he will be brought up to trial.<br/><br/>_Cal_. And on this testimony would he perish?<br/><br/>_Ben_. So your confession be detailed and full,<br/>He will stand here in peril of his life.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Then look well to thy proud self, President!<br/>For by the Eternity which yawns before me,<br/>I swear that _thou_, and only thou, shall be<br/>The traitor I denounce upon that rack,<br/>If I be stretched there for the second time.<br/><br/>_One of the Giunta_. Lord President,'twere best proceed to judgment;<br/>There is no more to be drawn from these men.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Unhappy men! prepare for instant death.<br/>The nature of your crime--our law--and peril<br/>The State now stands in, leave not an hour's respite.<br/>Guards! lead them forth, and upon the balcony<br/>Of the red columns, where, on festal Thursday,<br/>The Doge stands to behold the chase of bulls,<br/>Let them be justified: and leave exposed<br/>Their wavering relics, in the place of judgment,<br/>To the full view of the assembled people!<br/>And Heaven have mercy on their souls!<br/><br/>_The Giunta_.                           Amen!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Signors, farewell! we shall not all again<br/>Meet in one place.<br/><br/>_Ben_.            And lest they should essay<br/>To stir up the distracted multitude--<br/>Guards! let their mouths be gagged even in the act<br/>Of execution. Lead them hence!<br/><br/>_Cal_.                        What! must we<br/>Not even say farewell to some fond friend,<br/>Nor leave a last word with our confessor?<br/><br/>_Ben_. A priest is waiting in the antechamber;<br/>But, for your friends, such interviews would be<br/>Painful to them, and useless all to you.<br/><br/>_Cal_. I knew that we were gagged in life; at least<br/>All those who had not heart to risk their lives<br/>Upon their open thoughts; but still I deemed<br/>That in the last few moments, the same idle<br/>Freedom of speech accorded to the dying,<br/>Would not now be denied to us; but since----<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. Even let them have their way, brave Calendaro!<br/>What matter a few syllables? let's die<br/>Without the slightest show of favour from them;<br/>So shall our blood more readily arise<br/>To Heaven against them, and more testify<br/>To their atrocities, than could a volume<br/>Spoken or written of our dying words!<br/>They tremble at our voices--nay, they dread<br/>Our very silence--let them live in fear!<br/>Leave them unto their thoughts, and let us now<br/>Address our own above!--Lead on; we are ready.<br/><br/>_Cal_. Israel, hadst thou but hearkened unto me<br/>It had not now been thus; and yon pale villain,<br/>The coward Bertram, would----<br/><br/>_I. Ber_.                      Peace, Calendaro!<br/>What brooks it now to ponder upon this?<br/><br/>_Bert_. Alas! I fain you died in peace with me:<br/>I did not seek this task; 'twas forced upon me:<br/>Say, you forgive me, though I never can<br/>Retrieve my own forgiveness--frown not thus!<br/><br/>_I. Ber_. I die and pardon thee!<br/><br/>_Cal_. (_spitting at him_). I die and scorn thee!<br/>     [_Exeunt_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO, _Guards, etc_.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Now that these criminals have been disposed of,<br/>'Tis time that we proceed to pass our sentence<br/>Upon the greatest traitor upon record<br/>In any annals, the Doge Faliero!<br/>The proofs and process are complete; the time<br/>And crime require a quick procedure: shall<br/>He now be called in to receive the award?<br/><br/>_The Giunta_. Aye, aye.<br/><br/>_Ben_.                   Avogadori, order that the Doge<br/>Be brought before the Council.<br/><br/>_One of the Giunta_.            And the rest,<br/>When shall they be brought up?<br/><br/>_Ben_.                          When all the Chiefs<br/>Have been disposed of. Some have fled to Chiozza;<br/>But there are thousands in pursuit of them,<br/>And such precaution ta'en on terra firma,<br/>As well as in the islands, that we hope<br/>None will escape to utter in strange lands<br/>His libellous tale of treasons 'gainst the Senate.<br/><br/>     _Enter the_ DOGE _as Prisoner, with Guards, etc., etc._<br/><br/>_Ben_. Doge--for such still you are, and by the law<br/>Must be considered, till the hour shall come<br/>When you must doff the Ducal Bonnet from<br/>That head, which could not wear a crown more noble<br/>Than Empires can confer, in quiet honour,<br/>But it must plot to overthrow your peers,<br/>Who made you what you are, and quench in blood<br/>A City's glory--we have laid already<br/>Before you in your chamber at full length,<br/>By the Avogadori, all the proofs<br/>Which have appeared against you; and more ample<br/>Ne'er reared their sanguinary shadows to<br/>Confront a traitor. What have you to say<br/>In your defence?<br/><br/>_Doge_.            What shall I say to ye,<br/>Since my defence must be your condemnation?<br/>You are at once offenders and accusers,<br/>Judges and Executioners!--Proceed<br/>Upon your power.<br/><br/>_Ben_.             Your chief accomplices<br/>Having confessed, there is no hope for you.<br/><br/>_Doge_. And who be they?<br/><br/>_Ben_.                    In number many; but<br/>The first now stands before you in the court,<br/>Bertram of Bergamo,--would you question him?<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_looking at him contemptuously_).        No.<br/><br/>_Ben_. And two others, Israel Bertuccio,<br/>And Philip Calendaro, have admitted<br/>Their fellowship in treason with the Doge!<br/><br/>_Doge_. And where are they?<br/><br/>_Ben_.                    Gone to their place, and now<br/>Answering to Heaven for what they did on earth.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Ah! the plebeian Brutus, is he gone?<br/>And the quick Cassius of the arsenal?--<br/>How did they meet their doom?<br/><br/>_Ben_.                        Think of your own:<br/>It is approaching. You decline to plead, then?<br/><br/>_Doge_. I cannot plead to my inferiors, nor<br/>Can recognise your legal power to try me.<br/>Show me the law!<br/><br/>_Ben_.           On great emergencies,<br/>The law must be remodelled or amended:<br/>Our fathers had not fixed the punishment<br/>Of such a crime, as on the old Roman tables<br/>The sentence against parricide was left<br/>In pure forgetfulness; they could not render<br/>That penal, which had neither name nor thought<br/>In their great bosoms; who would have foreseen<br/>That Nature could be filed to such a crime<br/>As sons 'gainst sires, and princes 'gainst their realms?<br/>Your sin hath made us make a law which will<br/>Become a precedent 'gainst such haught traitors,<br/>As would with treason mount to tyranny;<br/>Not even contented with a sceptre, till<br/>They can convert it to a two-edged sword!<br/>Was not the place of Doge sufficient for ye?<br/>What's nobler than the signory of Venice?<br/><br/>_Doge_. The signory of Venice! You betrayed me--<br/>_You--you_, who sit there, traitors as ye are!<br/>From my equality with you in birth,<br/>And my superiority in action,<br/>You drew me from my honourable toils<br/>In distant lands--on flood, in field, in cities--<br/>_You_ singled me out like a victim to<br/>Stand crowned, but bound and helpless, at the altar<br/>Where you alone could minister. I knew not,<br/>I sought not, wished not, dreamed not the election,<br/>Which reached me first at Rome, and I obeyed;<br/>But found on my arrival, that, besides<br/>The jealous vigilance which always led you<br/>To mock and mar your Sovereign's best intents,<br/>You had, even in the interregnum of<br/>My journey to the capital, curtailed<br/>And mutilated the few privileges<br/>Yet left the Duke: all this I bore, and would<br/>Have borne, until my very hearth was stained<br/>By the pollution of your ribaldry,<br/>And he, the ribald, whom I see amongst you--<br/>Fit judge in such tribunal!----<br/><br/>_Ben_. (_interrupting him_).        Michel Steno<br/>Is here in virtue of his office, as<br/>One of the Forty; "the Ten" having craved<br/>A Giunta of patricians from the Senate<br/>To aid our judgment in a trial arduous<br/>And novel as the present: he was set<br/>Free from the penalty pronounced upon him,<br/>Because the Doge, who should protect the law,<br/>Seeking to abrogate all law, can claim<br/>No punishment of others by the statutes<br/>Which he himself denies and violates!<br/><br/>_Doge_. _His_ punishment! I rather see him _there_,<br/>Where he now sits, to glut him with my death,<br/>Than in the mockery of castigation,<br/>Which your foul, outward, juggling show of justice<br/>Decreed as sentence! Base as was his crime,<br/>'Twas purity compared with your protection.<br/><br/>_Ben_. And can it be, that the great Doge of Venice,<br/>With three parts of a century of years<br/>And honours on his head, could thus allow<br/>His fury, like an angry boy's, to master<br/>All Feeling, Wisdom, Faith and Fear, on such<br/>A provocation as a young man's petulance?<br/><br/>_Doge_. A spark creates the flame--'tis the last drop<br/>Which makes the cup run o'er, and mine was full<br/>Already: you oppressed the Prince and people;<br/>I would have freed both, and have failed in both:<br/>The price of such success would have been glory,<br/>Vengeance, and victory, and such a name<br/>As would have made Venetian history<br/>Rival to that of Greece and Syracuse<br/>When they were freed, and flourished ages after,<br/>And mine to Gelon and to Thrasybulus:<br/>Failing, I know the penalty of failure<br/>Is present infamy and death--the future<br/>Will judge, when Venice is no more, or free;<br/>Till then, the truth is in abeyance. Pause not;<br/>I would have shown no mercy, and I seek none;<br/>My life was staked upon a mighty hazard,<br/>And being lost, take what I would have taken!<br/>I would have stood alone amidst your tombs:<br/>Now you may flock round mine, and trample on it,<br/>As you have done upon my heart while living.<br/><br/>_Ben_. You do confess then, and admit the justice<br/>Of our Tribunal?<br/><br/>_Doge_.            I confess to have failed;<br/>Fortune is female: from my youth her favours<br/>Were not withheld, the fault was mine to hope<br/>Her former smiles again at this late hour.<br/><br/>_Ben_. You do not then in aught arraign our equity?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Noble Venetians! stir me not with questions.<br/>I am resigned to the worst; but in me still<br/>Have something of the blood of brighter days,<br/>And am not over-patient. Pray you, spare me<br/>Further interrogation, which boots nothing,<br/>Except to turn a trial to debate.<br/>I shall but answer that which will offend you,<br/>And please your enemies--a host already;<br/>'Tis true, these sullen walls should yield no echo:<br/>But walls have ears--nay, more, they have tongues; and if<br/>There were no other way for Truth to o'erleap them,<br/>You who condemn me, you who fear and slay me,<br/>Yet could not bear in silence to your graves<br/>What you would hear from me of Good or Evil;<br/>The secret were too mighty for your souls:<br/>Then let it sleep in mine, unless you court<br/>A danger which would double that you escape.<br/>Such my defence would be, had I full scope<br/>To make it famous; for true _words_ are _things_,<br/>And dying men's are things which long outlive,<br/>And oftentimes avenge them; bury mine,<br/>If ye would fain survive me: take this counsel,<br/>And though too oft ye make me live in wrath,<br/>Let me die calmly; you may grant me this;<br/>I deny nothing--defend nothing--nothing<br/>I ask of you, but silence for myself,<br/>And sentence from the Court!<br/><br/>_Ben_.                        This full admission<br/>Spares us the harsh necessity of ordering<br/>The torture to elicit the whole truth.<br/><br/>_Doge_. The torture! you have put me there already,<br/>Daily since I was Doge; but if you will<br/>Add the corporeal rack, you may: these limbs<br/>Will yield with age to crushing iron; but<br/>There's that within my heart shall strain your engines.<br/><br/>                       _Enter an_ OFFICER.<br/><br/>_Officer_. Noble Venetians! Duchess Faliero<br/>Requests admission to the Giunta's presence.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Say, Conscript Fathers, shall she be admitted?<br/><br/>_One of the Giunta_.  She may have revelations of importance<br/>Unto the state, to justify compliance<br/>With her request.<br/><br/>_Ben_.              Is this the general will?<br/><br/>_All_. It is.<br/><br/>_Doge_.         Oh, admirable laws of Venice!<br/>Which would admit the wife, in the full hope<br/>That she might testify against the husband.<br/>What glory to the chaste Venetian dames!<br/>But such blasphemers 'gainst all Honour, as<br/>Sit here, do well to act in their vocation.<br/>Now, villain Steno! if this woman fail,<br/>I'll pardon thee thy lie, and thy escape,<br/>And my own violent death, and thy vile life.<br/><br/>                     _The_ DUCHESS _enters_.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Lady! this just Tribunal has resolved,<br/>Though the request be strange, to grant it, and<br/>Whatever be its purport, to accord<br/>A patient hearing with the due respect<br/>Which fits your ancestry, your rank, and virtues:<br/>But you turn pale--ho! there, look to the Lady!<br/>Place a chair instantly.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                   A moment's faintness--<br/>'Tis past; I pray you pardon me,--I sit not<br/>In presence of my Prince and of my husband,<br/>While he is on his feet.<br/><br/>_Ben_.                    Your pleasure, Lady?<br/><br/>_Ang_. Strange rumours, but most true, if all I hear<br/>And see be sooth, have reached me, and I come<br/>To know the worst, even at the worst; forgive<br/>The abruptness of my entrance and my bearing.<br/>Is it--I cannot speak--I cannot shape<br/>The question--but you answer it ere spoken,<br/>With eyes averted, and with gloomy brows--<br/>Oh God! this is the silence of the grave!<br/><br/>_Ben_. (_after a pause_). Spare us, and spare thyself the repetition<br/>Of our most awful, but inexorable<br/>Duty to Heaven and man!<br/><br/>_Ang_.                 Yet speak; I cannot--<br/>I cannot--no--even now believe these things.<br/>Is _he_ condemned?<br/><br/>_Ben_.            Alas!<br/><br/>_Ang_.                   And was he guilty?<br/><br/>_Ben_. Lady! the natural distraction of<br/>Thy thoughts at such a moment makes the question<br/>Merit forgiveness; else a doubt like this<br/>Against a just and paramount tribunal<br/>Were deep offence. But question even the Doge,<br/>And if he can deny the proofs, believe him<br/>Guiltless as thy own bosom.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                       Is it so?<br/>My Lord, my Sovereign, my poor father's friend,<br/>The mighty in the field, the sage in Council,<br/>Unsay the words of this man!--thou art silent!<br/><br/>_Ben_. He hath already owned to his own guilt,<br/>Nor, as thou see'st, doth he deny it now.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Aye, but he must not die! Spare his few years,<br/>Which Grief and Shame will soon cut down to days!<br/>One day of baffled crime must not efface<br/>Near sixteen lustres crowned with brave acts.<br/><br/>_Ben_. His doom must be fulfilled without remission<br/>Of time or penalty--'tis a decree.<br/><br/>_Ang_. He hath been guilty, but there may be mercy.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Not in this case with justice.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                                 Alas! Signor,<br/>He who is only just is cruel; who<br/>Upon the earth would live were all judged justly?<br/><br/>_Ben_. His punishment is safety to the State.<br/><br/>_Ang_. He was a subject, and hath served the State;<br/>He was your General, and hath saved the State;<br/>He is your Sovereign, and hath ruled the State.<br/><br/>_One of the Council_. He is a traitor, and betrayed the State.<br/><br/>_Ang_. And, but for him, there now had been no State<br/>To save or to destroy; and you, who sit<br/>There to pronounce the death of your deliverer,<br/>Had now been groaning at a Moslem oar,<br/>Or digging in the Hunnish mines in fetters!<br/><br/>_One of the Council_. No, Lady, there are others who would die<br/>Rather than breathe in slavery!<br/><br/>_Ang_.                           If there are so<br/>Within _these_ walls, _thou_ art not of the number:<br/>The truly brave are generous to the fallen!--<br/>Is there no hope?<br/><br/>_Ben_.             Lady, it cannot be.<br/><br/>_Ang_. (_turning to the Doge_).<br/>Then die, Faliero! since it must be so;<br/>But with the spirit of my father's friend.<br/>Thou hast been guilty of a great offence,<br/>Half cancelled by the harshness of these men.<br/>I would have sued to them, have prayed to them.<br/>Have begged as famished mendicants for bread,<br/>Have wept as they will cry unto their God<br/>For mercy, and be answered as they answer,--<br/>Had it been fitting for thy name or mine,<br/>And if the cruelty in their cold eyes<br/>Had not announced the heartless wrath within.<br/>Then, as a Prince, address thee to thy doom!<br/><br/>_Doge_. I have lived too long not to know how to die!<br/>Thy suing to these men were but the bleating<br/>Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry<br/>Of seamen to the surge: I would not take<br/>A life eternal, granted at the hands<br/>Of wretches, from whose monstrous villanies<br/>I sought to free the groaning nations!<br/><br/>_Michel Steno_.                        Doge,<br/>A word with thee, and with this noble lady,<br/>Whom I have grievously offended. Would<br/>Sorrow, or shame, or penance on my part,<br/>Could cancel the inexorable past!<br/>But since that cannot be, as Christians let us<br/>Say farewell, and in peace: with full contrition<br/>I crave, not pardon, but compassion from you,<br/>And give, however weak, my prayers for both.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Sage Benintende, now chief Judge of Venice,<br/>I speak to thee in answer to yon Signor.<br/>Inform the ribald Steno, that his words<br/>Ne'er weighed in mind with Loredano's daughter,<br/>Further than to create a moment's pity<br/>For such as he is: would that others had<br/>Despised him as I pity! I prefer<br/>My honour to a thousand lives, could such<br/>Be multiplied in mine, but would not have<br/>A single life of others lost for that<br/>Which nothing human can impugn--the sense<br/>Of Virtue, looking not to what is called<br/>A good name for reward, but to itself.<br/>To me the scorner's words were as the wind<br/>Unto the rock: but as there are--alas!<br/>Spirits more sensitive, on which such things<br/>Light as the Whirlwind on the waters; souls<br/>To whom Dishonour's shadow is a substance<br/>More terrible than Death, here and hereafter;<br/>Men whose vice is to start at Vice's scoffing,<br/>And who, though proof against all blandishments<br/>Of pleasure, and all pangs of Pain, are feeble<br/>When the proud name on which they pinnacled<br/>Their hopes is breathed on, jealous as the eagle<br/>Of her high aiery; let what we now<br/>Behold, and feel, and suffer, be a lesson<br/>To wretches how they tamper in their spleen<br/>With beings of a higher order. Insects<br/>Have made the lion mad ere now; a shaft<br/>I' the heel o'erthrew the bravest of the brave;<br/>A wife's Dishonour was the bane of Troy;<br/>A wife's Dishonour unkinged Rome for ever;<br/>An injured husband brought the Gauls to Clusium,<br/>And thence to Rome, which perished for a time;<br/>An obscene gesture cost Caligula<br/>His life, while Earth yet bore his cruelties;<br/>A virgin's wrong made Spain a Moorish province;<br/>And Steno's lie, couched in two worthless lines,<br/>Hath decimated Venice, put in peril<br/>A Senate which hath stood eight hundred years,<br/>Discrowned a Prince, cut off his crownless head,<br/>And forged new fetters for a groaning people!<br/>Let the poor wretch, like to the courtesan<br/>Who fired Persepolis, be proud of this,<br/>If it so please him--'twere a pride fit for him!<br/>But let him not insult the last hours of<br/>Him, who, whate'er he now is, _was_ a Hero,<br/>By the intrusion of his very prayers;<br/>Nothing of good can come from such a source,<br/>Nor would we aught with him, nor now, nor ever:<br/>We leave him to himself, that lowest depth<br/>Of human baseness. Pardon is for men,<br/>And not for reptiles--we have none for Steno,<br/>And no resentment: things like him must sting,<br/>And higher beings suffer; 'tis the charter<br/>Of Life. The man who dies by the adder's fang<br/>May have the crawler crushed, but feels no anger:<br/>'Twas the worm's nature; and some men are worms<br/>In soul, more than the living things of tombs.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_to Ben._).<br/>Signor! complete that which you deem your duty.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Before we can proceed upon that duty,<br/>We would request the Princess to withdraw;<br/>'Twill move her too much to be witness to it.<br/><br/>_Ang_. I know it will, and yet I must endure it,<br/>For 'tis a part of mine--I will not quit,<br/>Except by force, my husband's side--Proceed!<br/>Nay, fear not either shriek, or sigh, or tear;<br/>Though my heart burst, it shall be silent.--Speak!<br/>I have that within which shall o'ermaster all.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice,<br/>Count of Val di Marino, Senator,<br/>And some time General of the Fleet and Army,<br/>Noble Venetian, many times and oft<br/>Intrusted by the state with high employments,<br/>Even to the highest, listen to the sentence.<br/>Convict by many witnesses and proofs,<br/>And by thine own confession, of the guilt<br/>Of Treachery and Treason, yet unheard of<br/>Until this trial--the decree is Death--<br/>Thy goods are confiscate unto the State,<br/>Thy name is razed from out her records, save<br/>Upon a public day of thanksgiving<br/>For this our most miraculous deliverance,<br/>When thou art noted in our calendars<br/>With earthquakes, pestilence, and foreign foes,<br/>And the great Enemy of man, as subject<br/>Of grateful masses for Heaven's grace in snatching<br/>Our lives and country from thy wickedness.<br/>The place wherein as Doge thou shouldst be painted<br/>With thine illustrious predecessors, is<br/>To be left vacant, with a death-black veil<br/>Flung over these dim words engraved beneath,--<br/>"This place is of Marino Faliero,<br/>Decapitated for his crimes."<br/><br/>_Doge_.                         "His _crimes_!"<br/>But let it be so:--it will be in vain.<br/>The veil which blackens o'er this blighted name,<br/>And hides, or seems to hide, these lineaments,<br/>Shall draw more gazers than the thousand portraits<br/>Which glitter round it in their pictured trappings--<br/>_Your_ delegated slaves--the people's tyrants!<br/>"Decapitated for his crimes!"--_What_ crimes?<br/>Were it not better to record the facts,<br/>So that the contemplator might approve,<br/>Or at the least learn _whence_ the crimes arose?<br/>When the beholder knows a Doge conspired,<br/>Let him be told the cause--it is your history.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Time must reply to that; our sons will judge<br/>Their fathers' judgment, which I now pronounce.<br/>As Doge, clad in the ducal robes and Cap,<br/>Thou shalt be led hence to the Giants' Staircase,<br/>Where thou and all our Princes are invested;<br/>And there, the Ducal Crown being first resumed<br/>Upon the spot where it was first assumed,<br/>Thy head shall be struck off; and Heaven have mercy<br/>Upon thy soul!<br/><br/>_Doge_.          Is this the Giunta's sentence?<br/><br/>_Ben_. It is.<br/><br/>_Doge_.       I can endure it.--And the time?<br/><br/>_Ben_. Must be immediate.--Make thy peace with God:<br/>Within an hour thou must be in His presence.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I am _already_; and my blood will rise<br/>To Heaven before the souls of those who shed it.<br/>Are all my lands confiscated?<br/><br/>_Ben_.                         They are;<br/>And goods, and jewels, and all kind of treasure,<br/>Except two thousand ducats--these dispose of.<br/><br/>_Doge_. That's harsh.--I would have fain reserved the lands<br/>Near to Treviso, which I hold by investment<br/>From Laurence the Count-bishop of Ceneda,<br/>In fief perpetual to myself and heirs,<br/>To portion them (leaving my city spoil,<br/>My palace and my treasures, to your forfeit)<br/>Between my consort and my kinsmen.<br/><br/>_Ben_.                               These<br/>Lie under the state's ban--their Chief, thy nephew,<br/>In peril of his own life; but the Council<br/>Postpones his trial for the present. If<br/>Thou will'st a state unto thy widowed Princess,<br/>Fear not, for we will do her justice.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                                 Signors,<br/>I share not in your spoil! From henceforth, know<br/>I am devoted unto God alone,<br/>And take my refuge in the cloister.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                             Come!<br/>The hour may be a hard one, but 'twill end.<br/>Have I aught else to undergo save Death?<br/><br/>_Ben_. You have nought to do, except confess and die.<br/>The priest is robed, the scimitar is bare,<br/>And both await without.--But, above all,<br/>Think not to speak unto the people; they<br/>Are now by thousands swarming at the gates,<br/>But these are closed: the Ten, the Avogadori,<br/>The Giunta, and the chief men of the Forty,<br/>Alone will be beholders of thy doom,<br/>And they are ready to attend the Doge.<br/><br/>_Doge_. The Doge!<br/><br/>_Ben_.           Yes, Doge, thou hast lived and thou shalt die<br/>A Sovereign; till the moment which precedes<br/>The separation of that head and trunk,<br/>That ducal crown and head shall be united.<br/>Thou hast forgot thy dignity in deigning<br/>To plot with petty traitors; not so we,<br/>Who in the very punishment acknowledge<br/>The Prince. Thy vile accomplices have died<br/>The dog's death, and the wolf's; but them shall fall<br/>As falls the lion by the hunters, girt<br/>By those who feel a proud compassion for thee,<br/>And mourn even the inevitable death<br/>Provoked by thy wild wrath, and regal fierceness.<br/>Now we remit thee to thy preparation:<br/>Let it be brief, and we ourselves will be<br/>Thy guides unto the place where first we were<br/>United to thee as thy subjects, and<br/>Thy Senate; and must now be parted from thee<br/>As such for ever, on the self-same spot.<br/>Guards! form the Doge's escort to his chamber.<br/>                                                            [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>SCENE II.--_The Doge's Apartment_.<br/><br/>    _The_ DOGE _as Prisoner, and the_ DUCHESS _attending him_.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Now, that the priest is gone, 'twere useless all<br/>To linger out the miserable minutes;<br/>But one pang more, the pang of parting from thee,<br/>And I will leave the few last grains of sand,<br/>Which yet remain of the accorded hour,<br/>Still falling--I have done with Time.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                                Alas!<br/>And I have been the cause, the unconscious cause;<br/>And for this funeral marriage, this black union,<br/>Which thou, compliant with my father's wish,<br/>Didst promise at _his_ death, thou hast sealed thine own.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Not so: there was that in my spirit ever<br/>Which shaped out for itself some great reverse;<br/>The marvel is, it came not until now--<br/>And yet it was foretold me.<br/><br/>_Ang_.                      How foretold you?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Long years ago--so long, they are a doubt<br/>In memory, and yet they live in annals:<br/>When I was in my youth, and served the Senate<br/>And Signory as Podesta and Captain<br/>Of the town of Treviso, on a day<br/>Of festival, the sluggish Bishop who<br/>Conveyed the Host aroused my rash young anger,<br/>By strange delay, and arrogant reply<br/>To my reproof: I raised my hand and smote him,<br/>Until he reeled beneath his holy burthen;<br/>And as he rose from earth again, he raised<br/>His tremulous hands in pious wrath towards Heaven.<br/>Thence pointing to the Host, which had fallen from him,<br/>He turned to me, and said, "The Hour will come<br/>When he thou hast o'erthrown shall overthrow thee:<br/>The Glory shall depart from out thy house,<br/>The Wisdom shall be shaken from thy soul,<br/>And in thy best maturity of Mind<br/>A madness of the heart shall seize upon thee;<br/>Passion shall tear thee when all passions cease<br/>In other men, or mellow into virtues;<br/>And Majesty which decks all other heads,<br/>Shall crown to leave thee headless; honours shall<br/>But prove to thee the heralds of Destruction,<br/>And hoary hairs of Shame, and both of Death,<br/>But not such death as fits an ag√©d man."<br/>Thus saying, he passed on.--That Hour is come.<br/><br/>_Ang_. And with this warning couldst thou not have striven<br/>To avert the fatal moment, and atone,<br/>By penitence, for that which thou hadst done?<br/><br/>_Doge_. I own the words went to my heart, so much<br/>That I remembered them amid the maze<br/>Of Life, as if they formed a spectral voice,<br/>Which shook me in a supernatural dream;<br/>And I repented; but 'twas not for me<br/>To pull in resolution: what must be<br/>I could not change, and would not fear.--Nay more,<br/>Thou can'st not have forgot, what all remember,<br/>That on my day of landing here as Doge,<br/>On my return from Rome, a mist of such<br/>Unwonted density went on before<br/>The Bucentaur, like the columnar cloud<br/>Which ushered Israel out of Egypt, till<br/>The pilot was misled, and disembarked us<br/>Between the Pillars of Saint Mark's, where 'tis<br/>The custom of the state to put to death<br/>Its criminals, instead of touching at<br/>The Riva della Paglia, as the wont is,--<br/>So that all Venice shuddered at the omen.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Ah! little boots it now to recollect<br/>Such things.<br/><br/>_Doge_.      And yet I find a comfort in<br/>The thought, that these things are the work of Fate;<br/>For I would rather yield to Gods than men,<br/>Or cling to any creed of destiny,<br/>Rather than deem these mortals, most of whom<br/>I know to be as worthless as the dust,<br/>And weak as worthless, more than instruments<br/>Of an o'er-ruling Power; they in themselves<br/>Were all incapable--they could not be<br/>Vistors of him who oft had conquered for them.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Employ the minutes left in aspirations<br/>Of a more healing nature, and in peace<br/>Even with these wretches take thy flight to Heaven.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I _am_ at peace: the peace of certainty<br/>That a sure Hour will come, when their sons' sons,<br/>And this proud city, and these azure waters,<br/>And all which makes them eminent and bright,<br/>Shall be a desolation and a curse,<br/>A hissing and a scoff unto the nations,<br/>A Carthage, and a Tyre, an Ocean Babel.<br/><br/>_Ang_. Speak not thus now: the surge of Passion still<br/>Sweeps o'er thee to the last; thou dost deceive<br/>Thyself, and canst not injure them--be calmer.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I stand within Eternity, and see<br/>Into Eternity, and I behold--<br/>Aye, palpable as I see thy sweet face<br/>For the last time--the days which I denounce<br/>Unto all time against these wave-girt walls,<br/>And they who are indwellers.<br/><br/>_Guard_ (_coming forward_).   Doge of Venice,<br/>The Ten are in attendance on your Highness.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Then farewell, Angiolina!--one embrace--<br/>Forgive the old man who hath been to thee<br/>A fond but fatal husband--love my memory--<br/>I would not ask so much for me still living,<br/>But thou canst judge of me more kindly now,<br/>Seeing my evil feelings are at rest.<br/>Besides, of all the fruit of these long years,<br/>Glory, and Wealth, and Power, and Fame, and Name,<br/>Which generally leave some flowers to bloom<br/>Even o'er the grave, I have nothing left, not even<br/>A little love, or friendship, or esteem,<br/>No, not enough to extract an epitaph<br/>From ostentatious kinsmen; in one hour<br/>I have uprooted all my former life,<br/>And outlived everything, except thy heart,<br/>The pure, the good, the gentle, which will oft<br/>With unimpaired but not a clamorous grief<br/>Still keep----Thou turn'st so pale!--Alas! she faints,<br/>She has no breath, no pulse!--Guards! lend your aid--<br/>I cannot leave her thus, and yet 'tis better,<br/>Since every lifeless moment spares a pang.<br/>When she shakes off this temporary death,<br/>I shall be with the Eternal.--Call her women--<br/>One look!--how cold her hand!--as cold as mine<br/>Shall be ere she recovers.--Gently tend her,<br/>And take my last thanks--I am ready now.<br/><br/>                   [_The Attendants of_ ANGIOLINA _enter, and surround<br/>                   their Mistress, who has fainted.--Exeunt the_ DOGE,<br/>                                                  _Guards, etc., etc._<br/><br/>SCENE III.--_The Court of the Ducal Palace; the outer gates<br/>  are shut against the people.--The_ DOGE _enters in his ducal<br/>  robes, in procession with the_ COUNCIL OF TEN _and other Patricians,<br/>  attended by the Guards, till they arrive at the top of the<br/>  "Giants' Staircase (where the Doges took the oaths); the<br/>  the Executioner is stationed there with his sword.--On arriving, a_<br/>  CHIEF OF THE TEN _takes off the ducal cap from the Doge's head_.<br/><br/>_Doge_. So now the Doge is nothing, and at last<br/>I am again Marino Faliero:<br/>'Tis well to be so, though but for a moment,<br/>Here was I crowned, and here, bear witness, Heaven!<br/>With how much more contentment I resign<br/>That shining mockery, the ducal bauble,<br/>Than I received the fatal ornament.<br/><br/>_One of the Ten_. Thou tremblest, Faliero!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                    'Tis with age, then.<br/><br/>_Ben_. Faliero! hast thou aught further to commend,<br/>Compatible with justice, to the Senate?<br/><br/>_Doge_. I would commend my nephew to their mercy,<br/>My consort to their justice; for methinks<br/>My death, and such a death, might settle all<br/>Between the State and me.<br/><br/>_Ben_.                    They shall be cared for;<br/>Even notwithstanding thine unheard-of crime.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Unheard of! aye, there's not a history<br/>But shows a thousand crowned conspirators<br/>_Against_ the people; but to set them free,<br/>One Sovereign only died, and one is dying.<br/><br/>_Ben_. And who were they who fell in such a cause?<br/><br/>_Doge_. The King of Sparta, and the Doge of Venice--<br/>Agis and Faliero!<br/><br/>_Ben_.           Hast thou more<br/>To utter or to do?<br/><br/>_Doge_.            May I speak?<br/><br/>_Ben_.                         Thou may'st;<br/>But recollect the people are without,<br/>Beyond the compass of the human voice.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I speak to Time and to Eternity,<br/>Of which I grow a portion, not to man.<br/>Ye Elements! in which to be resolved<br/>I hasten, let my voice be as a Spirit<br/>Upon you! Ye blue waves! which bore my banner.<br/>Ye winds! which fluttered o'er as if you loved it,<br/>And filled my swelling sails as they were wafted<br/>To many a triumph! Thou, my native earth,<br/>Which I have bled for! and thou, foreign earth,<br/>Which drank this willing blood from many a wound!<br/>Ye stones, in which my gore will not sink, but<br/>Reek up to Heaven! Ye skies, which will receive it!<br/>Thou Sun! which shinest on these things, and Thou!<br/>Who kindlest and who quenchest suns!--Attest!<br/>I am not innocent--but are these guiltless?<br/>I perish, but not unavenged; far ages<br/>Float up from the abyss of Time to be,<br/>And show these eyes, before they close, the doom<br/>Of this proud City, and I leave my curse<br/>On her and hers for ever!----Yes, the hours<br/>Are silently engendering of the day,<br/>When she, who built 'gainst Attila a bulwark,<br/>Shall yield, and bloodlessly and basely yield,<br/>Unto a bastard Attila, without<br/>Shedding so much blood in her last defence,<br/>As these old veins, oft drained in shielding her,<br/>Shall pour in sacrifice.--She shall be bought<br/>And sold, and be an appanage to those<br/>Who shall despise her!--She shall stoop to be<br/>A province for an Empire, petty town<br/>In lieu of Capital, with slaves for senates,<br/>Beggars for nobles, panders for a people!<br/>Then when the Hebrew's in thy palaces,<br/>The Hun in thy high places, and the Greek<br/>Walks o'er thy mart, and smiles on it for his;<br/>When thy patricians beg their bitter bread<br/>In narrow streets, and in their shameful need<br/>Make their nobility a plea for pity;<br/>Then, when the few who still retain a wreck<br/>Of their great fathers' heritage shall fawn<br/>Round a barbarian Vice of Kings' Vice-gerent,<br/>Even in the Palace where they swayed as Sovereigns,<br/>Even in the Palace where they slew their Sovereign,<br/>Proud of some name they have disgraced, or sprung<br/>From an adulteress boastful of her guilt<br/>With some large gondolier or foreign soldier,<br/>Shall bear about their bastardy in triumph<br/>To the third spurious generation;--when<br/>Thy sons are in the lowest scale of being,<br/>Slaves turned o'er to the vanquished by the victors,<br/>Despised by cowards for greater cowardice,<br/>And scorned even by the vicious for such vices<br/>As in the monstrous grasp of their conception<br/>Defy all codes to image or to name them;<br/>Then, when of Cyprus, now thy subject kingdom,<br/>All thine inheritance shall be her shame<br/>Entailed on thy less virtuous daughters, grown<br/>A wider proverb for worse prostitution;--<br/>When all the ills of conquered states shall cling thee,<br/>Vice without splendour, Sin without relief<br/>Even from the gloss of Love to smooth it o'er,<br/>But in its stead, coarse lusts of habitude,<br/>Prurient yet passionless, cold studied lewdness,<br/>Depraving Nature's frailty to an art;--<br/>When these and more are heavy on thee, when<br/>Smiles without mirth, and pastimes without Pleasure,<br/>Youth without Honour, Age without respect,<br/>Meanness and Weakness, and a sense of woe<br/>'Gainst which thou wilt not strive, and dar'st not murmur,<br/>Have made thee last and worst of peopled deserts,<br/>Then, in the last gasp of thine agony,<br/>Amidst thy many murders, think of _mine!_<br/>Thou den of drunkards with the blood of Princes!<br/>Gehenna of the waters! thou Sea-Sodom!<br/>Thus I devote thee to the Infernal Gods!<br/>Thee and thy serpent seed!<br/>               [_Here the_ DOGE _turns and addresses the Executioner._<br/>                           Slave, do thine office!<br/>Strike as I struck the foe! Strike as I would<br/>Have struck those tyrants! Strike deep as my curse!<br/>Strike--and but once!<br/><br/>                    [_The_ DOGE _throws himself upon his knees, and as<br/>                   the Executioner raises his sword the scene closes._<br/><br/>SCENE IV.--_The Piazza and Piazzetta of St. Mark's.--<br/>       The people in crowds gathered round the grated gates<br/>              of the Ducal Palace, which are shut._<br/><br/>_First Citizen_. I have gained the Gate, and can discern the Ten,<br/>Robed in their gowns of state, ranged round the Doge.<br/><br/>_Second Cit_. I cannot reach thee with mine utmost effort.<br/>How is it? let us hear at least, since sight<br/>Is thus prohibited unto the people,<br/>Except the occupiers of those bars.<br/><br/>_First Cit_. One has approached the Doge, and now they strip<br/>The ducal bonnet from his head--and now<br/>He raises his keen eyes to Heaven; I see<br/>Them glitter, and his lips move--Hush! hush!--no,<br/>'Twas but a murmur--Curse upon the distance!<br/>His words are inarticulate, but the voice<br/>Swells up like muttered thunder; would we could<br/>But gather a sole sentence!<br/><br/>_Second Cit_. Hush! we perhaps may catch the sound.<br/><br/>_First Cit_.                                        'Tis vain.<br/>I cannot hear him.--How his hoary hair<br/>Streams on the wind like foam upon the wave!<br/>Now--now--he kneels--and now they form a circle<br/>Round him, and all is hidden--but I see<br/>The lifted sword in air----Ah! hark! it falls!<br/><br/>                                                 [_The people murmur._<br/><br/>_Third Cit_. Then they have murdered him who would have freed us.<br/><br/>_Fourth Cit_. He was a kind man to the commons ever.<br/><br/>_Fifth Cit_. Wisely they did to keep their portals barred.<br/>Would we had known the work they were preparing<br/>Ere we were summoned here--we would have brought<br/>Weapons, and forced them!<br/><br/>_Sixth Cit_.              Are you sure he's dead?<br/><br/>_First Cit_. I saw the sword fall--Lo! what have we here?<br/><br/>   _Enter on the Balcony of the Palace which fronts St. Mark's<br/>      Place a_ CHIEF OF THE TEN, _with a bloody sword.<br/>       He waves it thrice before the People, and exclaims,_<br/><br/>"Justice hath dealt upon the mighty Traitor!"<br/><br/>              [_The gates are opened; the populace rush in towards the<br/>              "Giants' Staircase," where the execution has taken place<br/>                       The foremost of them exclaims to those behind,_<br/><br/>"The gory head rolls down the Giants' Steps!"<br/>[_The curtain falls_.
