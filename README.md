  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Sister Rosa: A Ballad by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    The death-bell beats!--<br/>The mountain repeats<br/>The echoing sound of the knell;<br/>And the dark Monk now<br/>Wraps the cowl round his brow,<br/>As he sits in his lonely cell.<br/><br/>And the cold hand of death<br/>Chills his shuddering breath,<br/>As he lists to the fearful lay<br/>Which the ghosts of the sky,<br/>As they sweep wildly by,<br/>Sing to departed day.<br/>And they sing of the hour<br/>When the stern fates had power<br/>To resolve Rosa's form to its clay.<br/><br/>But that hour is past;<br/>And that hour was the last<br/>Of peace to the dark Monk's brain.<br/>Bitter tears, from his eyes, gushed silent and fast;<br/>And he strove to suppress them in vain.<br/><br/>Then his fair cross of gold he dashed on the floor,<br/>When the death-knell struck on his ear.--<br/>'Delight is in store<br/>For her evermore;<br/>But for me is fate, horror, and fear.'<br/><br/>Then his eyes wildly rolled,<br/>When the death-bell tolled,<br/>And he raged in terrific woe.<br/>And he stamped on the ground,--<br/>But when ceased the sound,<br/>Tears again began to flow.<br/><br/>And the ice of despair<br/>Chilled the wild throb of care,<br/>And he sate in mute agony still;<br/>Till the night-stars shone through the cloudless air,<br/>And the pale moonbeam slept on the hill.<br/><br/>Then he knelt in his cell:--<br/>And the horrors of hell<br/>Were delights to his agonized pain,<br/>And he prayed to God to dissolve the spell,<br/>Which else must for ever remain.<br/><br/>And in fervent pray'r he knelt on the ground,<br/>Till the abbey bell struck One:<br/>His feverish blood ran chill at the sound:<br/>A voice hollow and horrible murmured around--<br/>'The term of thy penance is done!'<br/><br/>Grew dark the night;<br/>The moonbeam bright<br/>Waxed faint on the mountain high;<br/>And, from the black hill,<br/>Went a voice cold and still,--<br/>'Monk! thou art free to die.'<br/><br/>Then he rose on his feet,<br/>And his heart loud did beat,<br/>And his limbs they were palsied with dread;<br/>Whilst the grave's clammy dew<br/>O'er his pale forehead grew;<br/>And he shuddered to sleep with the dead.<br/><br/>And the wild midnight storm<br/>Raved around his tall form,<br/>As he sought the chapel's gloom:<br/>And the sunk grass did sigh<br/>To the wind, bleak and high,<br/>As he searched for the new-made tomb.<br/><br/>And forms, dark and high,<br/>Seemed around him to fly,<br/>And mingle their yells with the blast:<br/>And on the dark wall<br/>Half-seen shadows did fall,<br/>As enhorrored he onward passed.<br/><br/>And the storm-fiends wild rave<br/>O'er the new-made grave,<br/>And dread shadows linger around.<br/>The Monk called on God his soul to save,<br/>And, in horror, sank on the ground.<br/><br/>Then despair nerved his arm<br/>To dispel the charm,<br/>And he burst Rosa's coffin asunder.<br/>And the fierce storm did swell<br/>More terrific and fell,<br/>And louder pealed the thunder.<br/><br/>And laughed, in joy, the fiendish throng,<br/>Mixed with ghosts of the mouldering dead:<br/>And their grisly wings, as they floated along,<br/>Whistled in murmurs dread.<br/><br/>And her skeleton form the dead Nun reared<br/>Which dripped with the chill dew of hell.<br/>In her half-eaten eyeballs two pale flames appeared,<br/>And triumphant their gleam on the dark Monk glared,<br/>As he stood within the cell.<br/><br/>And her lank hand lay on his shuddering brain;<br/>But each power was nerved by fear.--<br/>'I never, henceforth, may breathe again;<br/>Death now ends mine anguished pain.--<br/>The grave yawns,--we meet there.'<br/><br/>And her skeleton lungs did utter the sound,<br/>So deadly, so lone, and so fell,<br/>That in long vibrations shuddered the ground;<br/>And as the stern notes floated around,<br/>A deep groan was answered from hell.
