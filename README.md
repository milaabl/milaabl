# üíÆ Julian and Maddalo.  a Conversation by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    PREFACE.<br/><br/>The meadows with fresh streams, the bees with thyme,<br/>The goats with the green leaves of budding Spring,<br/>Are saturated not--nor Love with tears.--VIRGIL'S "Gallus".<br/><br/>I rode one evening with Count Maddalo<br/>Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow<br/>Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand<br/>Of hillocks, heaped from ever-shifting sand,<br/>Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,<br/>Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,<br/>Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,<br/>Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,<br/>Abandons; and no other object breaks<br/>The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes<br/>Broken and unrepaired, and the tide makes<br/>A narrow space of level sand thereon,<br/>Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.<br/>This ride was my delight. I love all waste<br/>And solitary places; where we taste<br/>The pleasure of believing what we see<br/>Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:<br/>And such was this wide ocean, and this shore<br/>More barren than its billows; and yet more<br/>Than all, with a remembered friend I love<br/>To ride as then I rode;--for the winds drove<br/>The living spray along the sunny air<br/>Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,<br/>Stripped to their depths by the awakening north;<br/>And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth<br/>Harmonising with solitude, and sent<br/>Into our hearts aereal merriment.<br/>So, as we rode, we talked; and the swift thought,<br/>Winging itself with laughter, lingered not,<br/>But flew from brain to brain,--such glee was ours,<br/>Charged with light memories of remembered hours,<br/>None slow enough for sadness: till we came<br/>Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.<br/>This day had been cheerful but cold, and now<br/>The sun was sinking, and the wind also.<br/>Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be<br/>Talk interrupted with such raillery<br/>As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn<br/>The thoughts it would extinguish: --'twas forlorn,<br/>Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,<br/>The devils held within the dales of Hell<br/>Concerning God, freewill and destiny:<br/>Of all that earth has been or yet may be,<br/>All that vain men imagine or believe,<br/>Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,<br/>We descanted; and I (for ever still<br/>Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)<br/>Argued against despondency, but pride<br/>Made my companion take the darker side.<br/>The sense that he was greater than his kind<br/>Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind<br/>By gazing on its own exceeding light.<br/>Meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight,<br/>Over the horizon of the mountains;--Oh,<br/>How beautiful is sunset, when the glow<br/>Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,<br/>Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!<br/>Thy mountains, seas and vineyards, and the towers<br/>Of cities they encircle!--it was ours<br/>To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,<br/>Just where we had dismounted, the Count's men<br/>Were waiting for us with the gondola.--<br/>As those who pause on some delightful way<br/>Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood<br/>Looking upon the evening, and the flood<br/>Which lay between the city and the shore,<br/>Paved with the image of the sky...the hoar<br/>And aery Alps towards the North appeared<br/>Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark reared<br/>Between the East and West; and half the sky<br/>Was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry<br/>Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew<br/>Down the steep West into a wondrous hue<br/>Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent<br/>Where the swift sun yet paused in his descent<br/>Among the many-folded hills: they were<br/>Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,<br/>As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,<br/>The likeness of a clump of peaked isles--<br/>And then--as if the Earth and Sea had been<br/>Dissolved into one lake of fire, were seen<br/>Those mountains towering as from waves of flame<br/>Around the vaporous sun, from which there came<br/>The inmost purple spirit of light, and made<br/>Their very peaks transparent. 'Ere it fade,'<br/>Said my companion, 'I will show you soon<br/>A better station'--so, o'er the lagune<br/>We glided; and from that funereal bark<br/>I leaned, and saw the city, and could mark<br/>How from their many isles, in evening's gleam,<br/>Its temples and its palaces did seem<br/>Like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven.<br/>I was about to speak, when--'We are even<br/>Now at the point I meant,' said Maddalo,<br/>And bade the gondolieri cease to row.<br/>'Look, Julian, on the west, and listen well<br/>If you hear not a deep and heavy bell.'<br/>I looked, and saw between us and the sun<br/>A building on an island; such a one<br/>As age to age might add, for uses vile,<br/>A windowless, deformed and dreary pile;<br/>And on the top an open tower, where hung<br/>A bell, which in the radiance swayed and swung;<br/>We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:<br/>The broad sun sunk behind it, and it tolled<br/>In strong and black relief.--'What we behold<br/>Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,'<br/>Said Maddalo, 'and ever at this hour<br/>Those who may cross the water, hear that bell<br/>Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,<br/>To vespers.'--'As much skill as need to pray<br/>In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they<br/>To their stern maker,' I replied. 'O ho!<br/>You talk as in years past,' said Maddalo.<br/>''Tis strange men change not. You were ever still<br/>Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel,<br/>A wolf for the meek lambs--if you can't swim<br/>Beware of Providence.' I looked on him,<br/>But the gay smile had faded in his eye.<br/>'And such,'--he cried, 'is our mortality,<br/>And this must be the emblem and the sign<br/>Of what should be eternal and divine!--<br/>And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,<br/>Hung in a heaven-illumined tower, must toll<br/>Our thoughts and our desires to meet below<br/>Round the rent heart and pray--as madmen do<br/>For what? they know not,--till the night of death<br/>As sunset that strange vision, severeth<br/>Our memory from itself, and us from all<br/>We sought and yet were baffled.' I recall<br/>The sense of what he said, although I mar<br/>The force of his expressions. The broad star<br/>Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,<br/>And the black bell became invisible,<br/>And the red tower looked gray, and all between<br/>The churches, ships and palaces were seen<br/>Huddled in gloom;--into the purple sea<br/>The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.<br/>We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola<br/>Conveyed me to my lodging by the way.<br/>The following morn was rainy, cold, and dim:<br/>Ere Maddalo arose, I called on him,<br/>And whilst I waited with his child I played;<br/>A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made;<br/>A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,<br/>Graceful without design and unforeseeing,<br/>With eyes--Oh speak not of her eyes!--which seem<br/>Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam<br/>With such deep meaning, as we never see<br/>But in the human countenance: with me<br/>She was a special favourite: I had nursed<br/>Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first<br/>To this bleak world; and she yet seemed to know<br/>On second sight her ancient playfellow,<br/>Less changed than she was by six months or so;<br/>For after her first shyness was worn out<br/>We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,<br/>When the Count entered. Salutations past--<br/>'The word you spoke last night might well have cast<br/>A darkness on my spirit--if man be<br/>The passive thing you say, I should not see<br/>Much harm in the religions and old saws<br/>(Tho' I may never own such leaden laws)<br/>Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:<br/>Mine is another faith.'--thus much I spoke<br/>And noting he replied not, added: 'See<br/>This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;<br/>She spends a happy time with little care,<br/>While we to such sick thoughts subjected are<br/>As came on you last night. It is our will<br/>That thus enchains us to permitted ill--<br/>We might be otherwise--we might be all<br/>We dream of happy, high, majestical.<br/>Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek,<br/>But in our mind? and if we were not weak<br/>Should we be less in deed than in desire?'<br/>'Ay, if we were not weak--and we aspire<br/>How vainly to be strong!' said Maddalo:<br/>'You talk Utopia.' 'It remains to know,'<br/>I then rejoined, 'and those who try may find<br/>How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;<br/>Brittle perchance as straw...We are assured<br/>Much may be conquered, much may be endured,<br/>Of what degrades and crushes us. We know<br/>That we have power over ourselves to do<br/>And suffer--what, we know not till we try;<br/>But something nobler than to live and die--<br/>So taught those kings of old philosophy<br/>Who reigned, before Religion made men blind;<br/>And those who suffer with their suffering kind<br/>Yet feel their faith, religion.' 'My dear friend,'<br/>Said Maddalo, 'my judgement will not bend<br/>To your opinion, though I think you might<br/>Make such a system refutation-tight<br/>As far as words go. I knew one like you<br/>Who to this city came some months ago,<br/>With whom I argued in this sort, and he<br/>Is now gone mad,--and so he answered me,--<br/>Poor fellow! but if you would like to go,<br/>We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show<br/>How vain are such aspiring theories.'<br/>'I hope to prove the induction otherwise,<br/>And that a want of that true theory, still,<br/>Which seeks a "soul of goodness" in things ill<br/>Or in himself or others, has thus bowed<br/>His being--there are some by nature proud,<br/>Who patient in all else demand but this--<br/>To love and be beloved with gentleness;<br/>And being scorned, what wonder if they die<br/>Some living death? this is not destiny<br/>But man's own wilful ill.'<br/>As thus I spoke<br/>Servants announced the gondola, and we<br/>Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea<br/>Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands.<br/>We disembarked. The clap of tortured hands,<br/>Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen,<br/>And laughter where complaint had merrier been,<br/>Moans, shrieks, and curses, and blaspheming prayers<br/>Accosted us. We climbed the oozy stairs<br/>Into an old courtyard. I heard on high,<br/>Then, fragments of most touching melody,<br/>But looking up saw not the singer there--<br/>Through the black bars in the tempestuous air<br/>I saw, like weeds on a wrecked palace growing,<br/>Long tangled locks flung wildly forth, and flowing,<br/>Of those who on a sudden were beguiled<br/>Into strange silence, and looked forth and smiled<br/>Hearing sweet sounds. Then I: 'Methinks there were<br/>A cure of these with patience and kind care,<br/>If music can thus move...but what is he<br/>Whom we seek here?' 'Of his sad history<br/>I know but this,' said Maddalo: 'he came<br/>To Venice a dejected man, and fame<br/>Said he was wealthy, or he had been so;<br/>Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe;<br/>But he was ever talking in such sort<br/>As you do--far more sadly--he seemed hurt,<br/>Even as a man with his peculiar wrong,<br/>To hear but of the oppression of the strong,<br/>Or those absurd deceits (I think with you<br/>In some respects, you know) which carry through<br/>The excellent impostors of this earth<br/>When they outface detection--he had worth,<br/>Poor fellow! but a humorist in his way'--<br/>'Alas, what drove him mad?' 'I cannot say:<br/>A lady came with him from France, and when<br/>She left him and returned, he wandered then<br/>About yon lonely isles of desert sand<br/>Till he grew wild--he had no cash or land<br/>Remaining,--the police had brought him here--<br/>Some fancy took him and he would not bear<br/>Removal; so I fitted up for him<br/>Those rooms beside the sea, to please his whim,<br/>And sent him busts and books and urns for flowers,<br/>Which had adorned his life in happier hours,<br/>And instruments of music--you may guess<br/>A stranger could do little more or less<br/>For one so gentle and unfortunate:<br/>And those are his sweet strains which charm the weight<br/>From madmen's chains, and make this Hell appear<br/>A heaven of sacred silence, hushed to hear.'--<br/>'Nay, this was kind of you--he had no claim,<br/>As the world says'--'None--but the very same<br/>Which I on all mankind were I as he<br/>Fallen to such deep reverse;--his melody<br/>Is interrupted--now we hear the din<br/>Of madmen, shriek on shriek, again begin;<br/>Let us now visit him; after this strain<br/>He ever communes with himself again,<br/>And sees nor hears not any.' Having said<br/>These words, we called the keeper, and he led<br/>To an apartment opening on the sea--<br/>There the poor wretch was sitting mournfully<br/>Near a piano, his pale fingers twined<br/>One with the other, and the ooze and wind<br/>Rushed through an open casement, and did sway<br/>His hair, and starred it with the brackish spray;<br/>His head was leaning on a music book,<br/>And he was muttering, and his lean limbs shook;<br/>His lips were pressed against a folded leaf<br/>In hue too beautiful for health, and grief<br/>Smiled in their motions as they lay apart--<br/>As one who wrought from his own fervid heart<br/>The eloquence of passion, soon he raised<br/>His sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed<br/>And spoke--sometimes as one who wrote, and thought<br/>His words might move some heart that heeded not,<br/>If sent to distant lands: and then as one<br/>Reproaching deeds never to be undone<br/>With wondering self-compassion; then his speech<br/>Was lost in grief, and then his words came each<br/>Unmodulated, cold, expressionless,--<br/>But that from one jarred accent you might guess<br/>It was despair made them so uniform:<br/>And all the while the loud and gusty storm<br/>Hissed through the window, and we stood behind<br/>Stealing his accents from the envious wind<br/>Unseen. I yet remember what he said<br/>Distinctly: such impression his words made.<br/><br/>'Month after month,' he cried, 'to bear this load<br/>And as a jade urged by the whip and goad<br/>To drag life on, which like a heavy chain<br/>Lengthens behind with many a link of pain!--<br/>And not to speak my grief--O, not to dare<br/>To give a human voice to my despair,<br/>But live, and move, and, wretched thing! smile on<br/>As if I never went aside to groan,<br/>And wear this mask of falsehood even to those<br/>Who are most dear--not for my own repose--<br/>Alas! no scorn or pain or hate could be<br/>So heavy as that falsehood is to me--<br/>But that I cannot bear more altered faces<br/>Than needs must be, more changed and cold embraces,<br/>More misery, disappointment, and mistrust<br/>To own me for their father...Would the dust<br/>Were covered in upon my body now!<br/>That the life ceased to toil within my brow!<br/>And then these thoughts would at the least be fled;<br/>Let us not fear such pain can vex the dead.<br/><br/>'What Power delights to torture us? I know<br/>That to myself I do not wholly owe<br/>What now I suffer, though in part I may.<br/>Alas! none strewed sweet flowers upon the way<br/>Where wandering heedlessly, I met pale Pain<br/>My shadow, which will leave me not again--<br/>If I have erred, there was no joy in error,<br/>But pain and insult and unrest and terror;<br/>I have not as some do, bought penitence<br/>With pleasure, and a dark yet sweet offence,<br/>For then,--if love and tenderness and truth<br/>Had overlived hope's momentary youth,<br/>My creed should have redeemed me from repenting;<br/>But loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting<br/>Met love excited by far other seeming<br/>Until the end was gained...as one from dreaming<br/>Of sweetest peace, I woke, and found my state<br/>Such as it is.--<br/>'O Thou, my spirit's mate<br/>Who, for thou art compassionate and wise,<br/>Wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes<br/>If this sad writing thou shouldst ever see--<br/>My secret groans must be unheard by thee,<br/>Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know<br/>Thy lost friend's incommunicable woe.<br/><br/>'Ye few by whom my nature has been weighed<br/>In friendship, let me not that name degrade<br/>By placing on your hearts the secret load<br/>Which crushes mine to dust. There is one road<br/>To peace and that is truth, which follow ye!<br/>Love sometimes leads astray to misery.<br/>Yet think not though subdued--and I may well<br/>Say that I am subdued--that the full Hell<br/>Within me would infect the untainted breast<br/>Of sacred nature with its own unrest;<br/>As some perverted beings think to find<br/>In scorn or hate a medicine for the mind<br/>Which scorn or hate have wounded--O how vain!<br/>The dagger heals not but may rend again...<br/>Believe that I am ever still the same<br/>In creed as in resolve, and what may tame<br/>My heart, must leave the understanding free,<br/>Or all would sink in this keen agony--<br/>Nor dream that I will join the vulgar cry;<br/>Or with my silence sanction tyranny;<br/>Or seek a moment's shelter from my pain<br/>In any madness which the world calls gain,<br/>Ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern<br/>As those which make me what I am; or turn<br/>To avarice or misanthropy or lust...<br/>Heap on me soon, O grave, thy welcome dust!<br/>Till then the dungeon may demand its prey,<br/>And Poverty and Shame may meet and say--<br/>Halting beside me on the public way--<br/>"That love-devoted youth is ours--let's sit<br/>Beside him--he may live some six months yet."<br/>Or the red scaffold, as our country bends,<br/>May ask some willing victim; or ye friends<br/>May fall under some sorrow which this heart<br/>Or hand may share or vanquish or avert;<br/>I am prepared--in truth, with no proud joy--<br/>To do or suffer aught, as when a boy<br/>I did devote to justice and to love<br/>My nature, worthless now!...<br/>'I must remove<br/>A veil from my pent mind. 'Tis torn aside!<br/>O, pallid as Death's dedicated bride,<br/>Thou mockery which art sitting by my side,<br/>Am I not wan like thee? at the grave's call<br/>I haste, invited to thy wedding-ball<br/>To greet the ghastly paramour, for whom<br/>Thou hast deserted me...and made the tomb<br/>Thy bridal bed...But I beside your feet<br/>Will lie and watch ye from my winding-sheet--<br/>Thus...wide awake tho' dead...yet stay, O stay!<br/>Go not so soon--I know not what I say--<br/>Hear but my reasons...I am mad, I fear,<br/>My fancy is o'erwrought...thou art not here...<br/>Pale art thou, 'tis most true...but thou art gone,<br/>Thy work is finished...I am left alone!--<br/>...<br/>'Nay, was it I who wooed thee to this breast<br/>Which, like a serpent, thou envenomest<br/>As in repayment of the warmth it lent?<br/>Didst thou not seek me for thine own content?<br/>Did not thy love awaken mine? I thought<br/>That thou wert she who said, "You kiss me not<br/>Ever, I fear you do not love me now"--<br/>In truth I loved even to my overthrow<br/>Her, who would fain forget these words: but they<br/>Cling to her mind, and cannot pass away.<br/>...<br/>'You say that I am proud--that when I speak<br/>My lip is tortured with the wrongs which break<br/>The spirit it expresses...Never one<br/>Humbled himself before, as I have done!<br/>Even the instinctive worm on which we tread<br/>Turns, though it wound not--then with prostrate head<br/>Sinks in the dusk and writhes like me--and dies?<br/>No: wears a living death of agonies!<br/>As the slow shadows of the pointed grass<br/>Mark the eternal periods, his pangs pass,<br/>Slow, ever-moving,--making moments be<br/>As mine seem--each an immortality!<br/>...<br/>'That you had never seen me--never heard<br/>My voice, and more than all had ne'er endured<br/>The deep pollution of my loathed embrace--<br/>That your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face--<br/>That, like some maniac monk, I had torn out<br/>The nerves of manhood by their bleeding root<br/>With mine own quivering fingers, so that ne'er<br/>Our hearts had for a moment mingled there<br/>To disunite in horror--these were not<br/>With thee, like some suppressed and hideous thought<br/>Which flits athwart our musings, but can find<br/>No rest within a pure and gentle mind...<br/>Thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word,<br/>And searedst my memory o'er them,--for I heard<br/>And can forget not...they were ministered<br/>One after one, those curses. Mix them up<br/>Like self-destroying poisons in one cup,<br/>And they will make one blessing which thou ne'er<br/>Didst imprecate for, on me,--death.<br/>...<br/>'It were<br/>A cruel punishment for one most cruel,<br/>If such can love, to make that love the fuel<br/>Of the mind's hell; hate, scorn, remorse, despair:<br/>But ME--whose heart a stranger's tear might wear<br/>As water-drops the sandy fountain-stone,<br/>Who loved and pitied all things, and could moan<br/>For woes which others hear not, and could see<br/>The absent with the glance of phantasy,<br/>And with the poor and trampled sit and weep,<br/>Following the captive to his dungeon deep;<br/>ME--who am as a nerve o'er which do creep<br/>The else unfelt oppressions of this earth,<br/>And was to thee the flame upon thy hearth,<br/>When all beside was cold--that thou on me<br/>Shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony--<br/>Such curses are from lips once eloquent<br/>With love's too partial praise--let none relent<br/>Who intend deeds too dreadful for a name<br/>Henceforth, if an example for the same<br/>They seek...for thou on me lookedst so, and so--<br/>And didst speak thus...and thus...I live to show<br/>How much men bear and die not!<br/>...<br/>'Thou wilt tell<br/>With the grimace of hate, how horrible<br/>It was to meet my love when thine grew less;<br/>Thou wilt admire how I could e'er address<br/>Such features to love's work...this taunt, though true,<br/>(For indeed Nature nor in form nor hue<br/>Bestowed on me her choicest workmanship)<br/>Shall not be thy defence...for since thy lip<br/>Met mine first, years long past, since thine eye kindled<br/>With soft fire under mine, I have not dwindled<br/>Nor changed in mind or body, or in aught<br/>But as love changes what it loveth not<br/>After long years and many trials.<br/><br/>'How vain<br/>Are words! I thought never to speak again,<br/>Not even in secret,--not to mine own heart--<br/>But from my lips the unwilling accents start,<br/>And from my pen the words flow as I write,<br/>Dazzling my eyes with scalding tears...my sight<br/>Is dim to see that charactered in vain<br/>On this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain<br/>And eats into it...blotting all things fair<br/>And wise and good which time had written there.<br/><br/>'Those who inflict must suffer, for they see<br/>The work of their own hearts, and this must be<br/>Our chastisement or recompense--O child!<br/>I would that thine were like to be more mild<br/>For both our wretched sakes...for thine the most<br/>Who feelest already all that thou hast lost<br/>Without the power to wish it thine again;<br/>And as slow years pass, a funereal train<br/>Each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend<br/>Following it like its shadow, wilt thou bend<br/>No thought on my dead memory?<br/>...<br/>'Alas, love!<br/>Fear me not...against thee I would not move<br/>A finger in despite. Do I not live<br/>That thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve?<br/>I give thee tears for scorn and love for hate;<br/>And that thy lot may be less desolate<br/>Than his on whom thou tramplest, I refrain<br/>From that sweet sleep which medicines all pain.<br/>Then, when thou speakest of me, never say<br/>"He could forgive not." Here I cast away<br/>All human passions, all revenge, all pride;<br/>I think, speak, act no ill; I do but hide<br/>Under these words, like embers, every spark<br/>Of that which has consumed me--quick and dark<br/>The grave is yawning...as its roof shall cover<br/>My limbs with dust and worms under and over<br/>So let Oblivion hide this grief...the air<br/>Closes upon my accents, as despair<br/>Upon my heart--let death upon despair!'<br/><br/>He ceased, and overcome leant back awhile,<br/>Then rising, with a melancholy smile<br/>Went to a sofa, and lay down, and slept<br/>A heavy sleep, and in his dreams he wept<br/>And muttered some familiar name, and we<br/>Wept without shame in his society.<br/>I think I never was impressed so much;<br/>The man who were not, must have lacked a touch<br/>Of human nature...then we lingered not,<br/>Although our argument was quite forgot,<br/>But calling the attendants, went to dine<br/>At Maddalo's; yet neither cheer nor wine<br/>Could give us spirits, for we talked of him<br/>And nothing else, till daylight made stars dim;<br/>And we agreed his was some dreadful ill<br/>Wrought on him boldly, yet unspeakable,<br/>By a dear friend; some deadly change in love<br/>Of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of;<br/>For whose sake he, it seemed, had fixed a blot<br/>Of falsehood on his mind which flourished not<br/>But in the light of all-beholding truth;<br/>And having stamped this canker on his youth<br/>She had abandoned him--and how much more<br/>Might be his woe, we guessed not--he had store<br/>Of friends and fortune once, as we could guess<br/>From his nice habits and his gentleness;<br/>These were now lost...it were a grief indeed<br/>If he had changed one unsustaining reed<br/>For all that such a man might else adorn.<br/>The colours of his mind seemed yet unworn;<br/>For the wild language of his grief was high,<br/>Such as in measure were called poetry;<br/>And I remember one remark which then<br/>Maddalo made. He said: 'Most wretched men<br/>Are cradled into poetry by wrong,<br/>They learn in suffering what they teach in song.'<br/><br/>If I had been an unconnected man,<br/>I, from this moment, should have formed some plan<br/>Never to leave sweet Venice,--for to me<br/>It was delight to ride by the lone sea;<br/>And then, the town is silent--one may write<br/>Or read in gondolas by day or night,<br/>Having the little brazen lamp alight,<br/>Unseen, uninterrupted; books are there,<br/>Pictures, and casts from all those statues fair<br/>Which were twin-born with poetry, and all<br/>We seek in towns, with little to recall<br/>Regrets for the green country. I might sit<br/>In Maddalo's great palace, and his wit<br/>And subtle talk would cheer the winter night<br/>And make me know myself, and the firelight<br/>Would flash upon our faces, till the day<br/>Might dawn and make me wonder at my stay:<br/>But I had friends in London too: the chief<br/>Attraction here, was that I sought relief<br/>From the deep tenderness that maniac wrought<br/>Within me--'twas perhaps an idle thought--<br/>But I imagined that if day by day<br/>I watched him, and but seldom went away,<br/>And studied all the beatings of his heart<br/>With zeal, as men study some stubborn art<br/>For their own good, and could by patience find<br/>An entrance to the caverns of his mind,<br/>I might reclaim him from this dark estate:<br/>In friendships I had been most fortunate--<br/>Yet never saw I one whom I would call<br/>More willingly my friend; and this was all<br/>Accomplished not; such dreams of baseless good<br/>Oft come and go in crowds or solitude<br/>And leave no trace--but what I now designed<br/>Made for long years impression on my mind.<br/>The following morning, urged by my affairs,<br/>I left bright Venice.<br/>After many years<br/>And many changes I returned; the name<br/>Of Venice, and its aspect, was the same;<br/>But Maddalo was travelling far away<br/>Among the mountains of Armenia.<br/>His dog was dead. His child had now become<br/>A woman; such as it has been my doom<br/>To meet with few,--a wonder of this earth,<br/>Where there is little of transcendent worth,<br/>Like one of Shakespeare's women: kindly she,<br/>And, with a manner beyond courtesy,<br/>Received her father's friend; and when I asked<br/>Of the lorn maniac, she her memory tasked,<br/>And told as she had heard the mournful tale:<br/>'That the poor sufferer's health began to fail<br/>Two years from my departure, but that then<br/>The lady who had left him, came again.<br/>Her mien had been imperious, but she now<br/>Looked meek--perhaps remorse had brought her low.<br/>Her coming made him better, and they stayed<br/>Together at my father's--for I played,<br/>As I remember, with the lady's shawl--<br/>I might be six years old--but after all<br/>She left him.'...'Why, her heart must have been tough:<br/>How did it end?' 'And was not this enough?<br/>They met--they parted.'--'Child, is there no more?'<br/>'Something within that interval which bore<br/>The stamp of WHY they parted, HOW they met:<br/>Yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet<br/>Those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears,<br/>Ask me no more, but let the silent years<br/>Be closed and cered over their memory<br/>As yon mute marble where their corpses lie.'<br/>I urged and questioned still, she told me how<br/>All happened--but the cold world shall not know.
