# üíÆ Beautiful Torquay by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    All ye lovers of the picturesque, away<br/>To beautiful Torquay and spend a holiday<br/>'Tis health for invalids for to go there<br/>To view the beautiful scenery and inhale the fragrant air,<br/>Especially in the winter and spring-time of the year,<br/>When the weather is not too hot, but is balmy and clear.<br/><br/>Torquay lies in a very deep and well-sheltered spot,<br/>And at first sight by strangers it won't be forgot;<br/>'Tis said to be the mildest place in ah England,<br/>And surrounded by lofty hills most beautiful and grand.<br/><br/>Twas here that William of Orange first touched English ground,<br/>And as he viewed the beautiful spot his heart with joy did rebound;<br/>And an obelisk marks the spot where he did stand,<br/>And which for long will be remembered throughout England.<br/><br/>Torquay, with its pier and its diadem of white,<br/>Is a moat beautiful and very dazzling sight,<br/>With its white villas glittering on the sides of its green hills,<br/>And as the tourist gases thereon with joy his heart fills.<br/><br/>The heights around Torquay are most beautiful to be seen,<br/>Especially when the trees and shrubberies are green,<br/>And to see the pretty houses under the cliff is a treat,<br/>And the little town enclosed where two deep valleys meet.<br/><br/>There is also a fine bathing establishment near the pier,<br/>Where the tourist can bathe without any fear;<br/>And as the tourists there together doth stroll,<br/>I advise them to visit a deep chasm called Daddy's Hole.<br/><br/>Then there's Bablicome, only two miles from Torquay,<br/>Which will make the stranger's heart feel gay,<br/>As he stands on the cliff four hundred feet above the sea,<br/>Looking down,'tis sure to fill his heart with ecstasy.<br/><br/>The lodging-houses at Bablicome are magnificent to be seen,<br/>And the accommodation there would suit either king or queen,<br/>And there's some exquisite cottages embowered in the woodland,<br/>And sloping down to the sea shore, is really very grand.<br/><br/>You do not wonder at Napoleon's exclamation<br/>As he stood on the deck of the "Bellerophon," in a fit of admiration,<br/>When the vessel was lying to windbound,<br/>He exclaimed - "Oh, what a beautiful country!" his joy was profound.<br/><br/>And as the tourist there in search of beautiful spots doth rove,<br/>Let them not forget to enquire for Anstey's Cove,<br/>And there they will see a beautiful beach of milky white,<br/>And the sight will fill their hearts with delight.<br/><br/>Oh! beautiful Torquay, with your lovely scenery,<br/>And your magnificent cottages sloping down to the sea,<br/>You are the most charming spot in all England,<br/>With your picturesque bay and villas most grand.<br/><br/>And, in conclusion, to tourists I will say,<br/>Off! off to Torquay and make no delay,<br/>For the scenery is magnificent, and salubrious the air,<br/>And 'tis good for the health to reside there.
