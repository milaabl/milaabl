# üíÆ English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers; a Satire by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Still must I hear?--shall hoarse FITZGERALD bawl<br/>His creaking couplets in a tavern hall,<br/>And I not sing, lest, haply, Scotch Reviews<br/>Should dub me scribbler, and denounce my _Muse?_<br/>Prepare for rhyme--I'll publish, right or wrong:<br/>Fools are my theme, let Satire be my song.<br/><br/>  Oh! Nature's noblest gift--my grey goose-quill!<br/>Slave of my thoughts, obedient to my will,<br/>Torn from thy parent bird to form a pen,<br/>That mighty instrument of little men!<br/>The pen! foredoomed to aid the mental throes<br/>Of brains that labour, big with Verse or Prose;<br/>Though Nymphs forsake, and Critics may deride,<br/>The Lover's solace, and the Author's pride.<br/>What Wits! what Poets dost thou daily raise!<br/>How frequent is thy use, how small thy praise!<br/>Condemned at length to be forgotten quite,<br/>With all the pages which 'twas thine to write.<br/>But thou, at least, mine own especial pen!<br/>Once laid aside, but now assumed again,<br/>Our task complete, like Hamet's shall be free;<br/>Though spurned by others, yet beloved by me:<br/>Then let us soar to-day; no common theme,<br/>No Eastern vision, no distempered dream<br/>Inspires--our path, though full of thorns, is plain;<br/>Smooth be the verse, and easy be the strain.<br/><br/>  When Vice triumphant holds her sov'reign sway,<br/>Obey'd by all who nought beside obey;<br/>When Folly, frequent harbinger of crime,<br/>Bedecks her cap with bells of every Clime;<br/>When knaves and fools combined o'er all prevail,<br/>And weigh their Justice in a Golden Scale;<br/>E'en then the boldest start from public sneers,<br/>Afraid of Shame, unknown to other fears,<br/>More darkly sin, by Satire kept in awe,<br/>And shrink from Ridicule, though not from Law.<br/><br/>  Such is the force of Wit! I but not belong<br/>To me the arrows of satiric song;<br/>The royal vices of our age demand<br/>A keener weapon, and a mightier hand.<br/>Still there are follies, e'en for me to chase,<br/>And yield at least amusement in the race:<br/>Laugh when I laugh, I seek no other fame,<br/>The cry is up, and scribblers are my game:<br/>Speed, Pegasus!--ye strains of great and small,<br/>Ode! Epic! Elegy!--have at you all!<br/>I, too, can scrawl, and once upon a time<br/>I poured along the town a flood of rhyme,<br/>A schoolboy freak, unworthy praise or blame;<br/>I printed--older children do the same.<br/>'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;<br/>A Book's a Book, altho' there's nothing in't.<br/>Not that a Title's sounding charm can save<br/>Or scrawl or scribbler from an equal grave:<br/>This LAMB must own, since his patrician name<br/>Failed to preserve the spurious Farce from shame.<br/>No matter, GEORGE continues still to write,<br/>Tho' now the name is veiled from public sight.<br/>Moved by the great example, I pursue<br/>The self-same road, but make my own review:<br/>Not seek great JEFFREY'S, yet like him will be<br/>Self-constituted Judge of Poesy.<br/><br/>  A man must serve his time to every trade<br/>Save Censure--Critics all are ready made.<br/>Take hackneyed jokes from MILLER, got by rote,<br/>With just enough of learning to misquote;<br/>A man well skilled to find, or forge a fault;<br/>A turn for punning--call it Attic salt;<br/>To JEFFREY go, be silent and discreet,<br/>His pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet:<br/>Fear not to lie,'twill seem a _sharper_ hit;<br/>Shrink not from blasphemy, 'twill pass for wit;<br/>Care not for feeling--pass your proper jest,<br/>And stand a Critic, hated yet caress'd.<br/><br/>And shall we own such judgment? no--as soon<br/>Seek roses in December--ice in June;<br/>Hope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff,<br/>Believe a woman or an epitaph,<br/>Or any other thing that's false, before<br/>You trust in Critics, who themselves are sore;<br/>Or yield one single thought to be misled<br/>By JEFFREY'S heart, or LAMB'S Boeotian head.<br/>To these young tyrants, by themselves misplaced,<br/>Combined usurpers on the Throne of Taste;<br/>To these, when Authors bend in humble awe,<br/>And hail their voice as Truth, their word as Law;<br/>While these are Censors, 'twould be sin to spare;<br/>While such are Critics, why should I forbear?<br/>But yet, so near all modern worthies run,<br/>'Tis doubtful whom to seek, or whom to shun;<br/>Nor know we when to spare, or where to strike,<br/>Our Bards and Censors are so much alike.<br/>Then should you ask me, why I venture o'er<br/>The path which POPE and GIFFORD trod before;<br/>If not yet sickened, you can still proceed;<br/>Go on; my rhyme will tell you as you read.<br/>"But hold!" exclaims a friend,--"here's some neglect:<br/>This--that--and t'other line seem incorrect."<br/>What then? the self-same blunder Pope has got,<br/>And careless Dryden--"Aye, but Pye has not:"--<br/>Indeed!--'tis granted, faith!--but what care I?<br/>Better to err with POPE, than shine with PYE.<br/><br/>  Time was, ere yet in these degenerate days<br/>Ignoble themes obtained mistaken praise,<br/>When Sense and Wit with Poesy allied,<br/>No fabled Graces, flourished side by side,<br/>From the same fount their inspiration drew,<br/>And, reared by Taste, bloomed fairer as they grew.<br/>Then, in this happy Isle, a POPE'S pure strain<br/>Sought the rapt soul to charm, nor sought in vain;<br/>A polished nation's praise aspired to claim,<br/>And raised the people's, as the poet's fame.<br/>Like him great DRYDEN poured the tide of song,<br/>In stream less smooth, indeed, yet doubly strong.<br/>Then CONGREVE'S scenes could cheer, or OTWAY'S melt;<br/>For Nature then an English audience felt--<br/>But why these names, or greater still, retrace,<br/>When all to feebler Bards resign their place?<br/>Yet to such times our lingering looks are cast,<br/>When taste and reason with those times are past.<br/>Now look around, and turn each trifling page,<br/>Survey the precious works that please the age;<br/>This truth at least let Satire's self allow,<br/>No dearth of Bards can be complained of now.<br/>The loaded Press beneath her labour groans,<br/>And Printers' devils shake their weary bones;<br/>While SOUTHEY'S Epics cram the creaking shelves,<br/>And LITTLE'S Lyrics shine in hot-pressed twelves.<br/>Thus saith the _Preacher_: "Nought beneath the sun<br/>Is new," yet still from change to change we run.<br/>What varied wonders tempt us as they pass!<br/>The Cow-pox, Tractors, Galvanism, and Gas,<br/>In turns appear, to make the vulgar stare,<br/>Till the swoln bubble bursts--and all is air!<br/>Nor less new schools of Poetry arise,<br/>Where dull pretenders grapple for the prize:<br/>O'er Taste awhile these Pseudo-bards prevail;<br/>Each country Book-club bows the knee to Baal,<br/>And, hurling lawful Genius from the throne,<br/>Erects a shrine and idol of its own;<br/>Some leaden calf--but whom it matters not,<br/>From soaring SOUTHEY, down to groveling STOTT.<br/><br/>  Behold! in various throngs the scribbling crew,<br/>For notice eager, pass in long review:<br/>Each spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,<br/>And Rhyme and Blank maintain an equal race;<br/>Sonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode;<br/>And Tales of Terror jostle on the road;<br/>Immeasurable measures move along;<br/>For simpering Folly loves a varied song,<br/>To strange, mysterious Dulness still the friend,<br/>Admires the strain she cannot comprehend.<br/>Thus Lays of Minstrels -may they be the last!--<br/>On half-strung harps whine mournful to the blast.<br/>While mountain spirits prate to river sprites,<br/>That dames may listen to the sound at nights;<br/>And goblin brats, of Gilpin Horner's brood<br/>Decoy young Border-nobles through the wood,<br/>And skip at every step, Lord knows how high,<br/>And frighten foolish babes, the Lord knows why;<br/>While high-born ladies in their magic cell,<br/>Forbidding Knights to read who cannot spell,<br/>Despatch a courier to a wizard's grave,<br/>And fight with honest men to shield a knave.<br/><br/>  Next view in state, proud prancing on his roan,<br/>The golden-crested haughty Marmion,<br/>Now forging scrolls, now foremost in the fight,<br/>Not quite a Felon, yet but half a Knight.<br/>The gibbet or the field prepared to grace;<br/>A mighty mixture of the great and base.<br/>And think'st thou, SCOTT! by vain conceit perchance,<br/>On public taste to foist thy stale romance,<br/>Though MURRAY with his MILLER may combine<br/>To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line?<br/>No! when the sons of song descend to trade,<br/>Their bays are sear, their former laurels fade,<br/>Let such forego the poet's sacred name,<br/>Who rack their brains for lucre, not for fame:<br/>Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain!<br/>And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain!<br/>Such be their meed, such still the just reward<br/>Of prostituted Muse and hireling bard!<br/>For this we spurn Apollo's venal son,<br/>And bid a long "good night to Marmion."<br/><br/>  These are the themes that claim our plaudits now;<br/>These are the Bards to whom the Muse must bow;<br/>While MILTON, DRYDEN, POPE, alike forgot,<br/>Resign their hallowed Bays to WALTER SCOTT.<br/><br/>  The time has been, when yet the Muse was young,<br/>When HOMER swept the lyre, and MARO sung,<br/>An Epic scarce ten centuries could claim,<br/>While awe-struck nations hailed the magic name:<br/>The work of each immortal Bard appears<br/>The single wonder of a thousand years.<br/>Empires have mouldered from the face of earth,<br/>Tongues have expired with those who gave them birth,<br/>Without the glory such a strain can give,<br/>As even in ruin bids the language live.<br/>Not so with us, though minor Bards, content,<br/>On one great work a life of labour spent:<br/>With eagle pinion soaring to the skies,<br/>Behold the Ballad-monger SOUTHEY rise!<br/>To him let CAMO√ãNS, MILTON, TASSO yield,<br/>Whose annual strains, like armies, take the field.<br/>First in the ranks see Joan of Arc advance,<br/>The scourge of England and the boast of France!<br/>Though burnt by wicked BEDFORD for a witch,<br/>Behold her statue placed in Glory's niche;<br/>Her fetters burst, and just released from prison,<br/>A virgin Phoenix from her ashes risen.<br/>Next see tremendous Thalaba come on,<br/>Arabia's monstrous, wild, and wond'rous son;<br/>Domdaniel's dread destroyer, who o'erthrew<br/>More mad magicians than the world e'er knew.<br/>Immortal Hero! all thy foes o'ercome,<br/>For ever reign--the rival of Tom Thumb!<br/>Since startled Metre fled before thy face,<br/>Well wert thou doomed the last of all thy race!<br/>Well might triumphant Genii bear thee hence,<br/>Illustrious conqueror of common sense!<br/>Now, last and greatest, Madoc spreads his sails,<br/>Cacique in Mexico, and Prince in Wales;<br/>Tells us strange tales, as other travellers do,<br/>More old than Mandeville's, and not so true.<br/>Oh, SOUTHEY! SOUTHEY! cease thy varied song!<br/>A bard may chaunt too often and too long:<br/>As thou art strong in verse, in mercy, spare!<br/>A fourth, alas! were more than we could bear.<br/>But if, in spite of all the world can say,<br/>Thou still wilt verseward plod thy weary way;<br/>If still in Berkeley-Ballads most uncivil,<br/>Thou wilt devote old women to the devil,<br/>The babe unborn thy dread intent may rue:<br/>"God help thee," SOUTHEY, and thy readers too.<br/><br/>  Next comes the dull disciple of thy school,<br/>That mild apostate from poetic rule,<br/>The simple WORDSWORTH, framer of a lay<br/>As soft as evening in his favourite May,<br/>Who warns his friend "to shake off toil and trouble,<br/>And quit his books, for fear of growing double;"<br/>Who, both by precept and example, shows<br/>That prose is verse, and verse is merely prose;<br/>Convincing all, by demonstration plain,<br/>Poetic souls delight in prose insane;<br/>And Christmas stories tortured into rhyme<br/>Contain the essence of the true sublime.<br/>Thus, when he tells the tale of Betty Foy,<br/>The idiot mother of "an idiot Boy;"<br/>A moon-struck, silly lad, who lost his way,<br/>And, like his bard, confounded night with day<br/>So close on each pathetic part he dwells,<br/>And each adventure so sublimely tells,<br/>That all who view the "idiot in his glory"<br/>Conceive the Bard the hero of the story.<br/><br/>  Shall gentle COLERIDGE pass unnoticed here,<br/>To turgid ode and tumid stanza dear?<br/>Though themes of innocence amuse him best,<br/>Yet still Obscurity's a welcome guest.<br/>If Inspiration should her aid refuse<br/>To him who takes a Pixy for a muse,<br/>Yet none in lofty numbers can surpass<br/>The bard who soars to elegize an ass:<br/>So well the subject suits his noble mind,<br/>He brays, the Laureate of the long-eared kind.<br/><br/>Oh! wonder-working LEWIS! Monk, or Bard,<br/>Who fain would make Parnassus a church-yard!<br/>Lo! wreaths of yew, not laurel, bind thy brow,<br/>Thy Muse a Sprite, Apollo's sexton thou!<br/>Whether on ancient tombs thou tak'st thy stand,<br/>By gibb'ring spectres hailed, thy kindred band;<br/>Or tracest chaste descriptions on thy page,<br/>To please the females of our modest age;<br/>All hail, M.P.! from whose infernal brain<br/>Thin-sheeted phantoms glide, a grisly train;<br/>At whose command "grim women" throng in crowds,<br/>And kings of fire, of water, and of clouds,<br/>With "small grey men,"--"wild yagers," and what not,<br/>To crown with honour thee and WALTER SCOTT:<br/>Again, all hail! if tales like thine may please,<br/>St. Luke alone can vanquish the disease:<br/>Even Satan's self with thee might dread to dwell,<br/>And in thy skull discern a deeper Hell.<br/><br/>Who in soft guise, surrounded by a choir<br/>Of virgins melting, not to Vesta's fire,<br/>With sparkling eyes, and cheek by passion flushed<br/>Strikes his wild lyre, whilst listening dames are hushed?<br/>'Tis LITTLE! young Catullus of his day,<br/>As sweet, but as immoral, in his Lay!<br/>Grieved to condemn, the Muse must still be just,<br/>Nor spare melodious advocates of lust.<br/>Pure is the flame which o'er her altar burns;<br/>From grosser incense with disgust she turns<br/>Yet kind to youth, this expiation o'er,<br/>She bids thee "mend thy line, and sin no more."<br/><br/>For thee, translator of the tinsel song,<br/>To whom such glittering ornaments belong,<br/>Hibernian STRANGFORD! with thine eyes of blue,<br/>And boasted locks of red or auburn hue,<br/>Whose plaintive strain each love-sick Miss admires,<br/>And o'er harmonious fustian half expires,<br/>Learn, if thou canst, to yield thine author's sense,<br/>Nor vend thy sonnets on a false pretence.<br/>Think'st thou to gain thy verse a higher place,<br/>By dressing Camo√´ns in a suit of lace?<br/>Mend, STRANGFORD! mend thy morals and thy taste;<br/>Be warm, but pure; be amorous, but be chaste:<br/>Cease to deceive; thy pilfered harp restore,<br/>Nor teach the Lusian Bard to copy MOORE.<br/><br/>Behold--Ye Tarts!--one moment spare the text! -<br/>HAYLEY'S last work, and worst--until his next;<br/>Whether he spin poor couplets into plays,<br/>Or damn the dead with purgatorial praise,<br/>His style in youth or age is still the same,<br/>For ever feeble and for ever tame.<br/>Triumphant first see "Temper's Triumphs" shine!<br/>At least I'm sure they triumphed over mine.<br/>Of "Music's Triumphs," all who read may swear<br/>That luckless Music never triumph'd there.<br/><br/>Moravians, rise! bestow some meet reward<br/>On dull devotion--Lo! the Sabbath Bard,<br/>Sepulchral GRAHAME, pours his notes sublime<br/>In mangled prose, nor e'en aspires to rhyme;<br/>Breaks into blank the Gospel of St. Luke,<br/>And boldly pilfers from the Pentateuch;<br/>And, undisturbed by conscientious qualms,<br/>Perverts the Prophets, and purloins the Psalms.<br/><br/>  Hail, Sympathy! thy soft idea brings"<br/>A thousand visions of a thousand things,<br/>And shows, still whimpering thro' threescore of years,<br/>The maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers.<br/>And art thou not their prince, harmonious Bowles!<br/>Thou first, great oracle of tender souls?<br/>Whether them sing'st with equal ease, and grief,<br/>The fall of empires, or a yellow leaf;<br/>Whether thy muse most lamentably tells<br/>What merry sounds proceed from Oxford bells,<br/>Or, still in bells delighting, finds a friend<br/>In every chime that jingled from Ostend;<br/>Ah! how much juster were thy Muse's hap,<br/>If to thy bells thou would'st but add a cap!<br/>Delightful BOWLES! still blessing and still blest,<br/>All love thy strain, but children like it best.<br/>'Tis thine, with gentle LITTLE'S moral song,<br/>To soothe the mania of the amorous throng!<br/>With thee our nursery damsels shed their tears,<br/>Ere Miss as yet completes her infant years:<br/>But in her teens thy whining powers are vain;<br/>She quits poor BOWLES for LITTLE'S purer strain.<br/>Now to soft themes thou scornest to confine<br/>The lofty numbers of a harp like thine;<br/>"Awake a louder and a loftier strain,"<br/>Such as none heard before, or will again!<br/>Where all discoveries jumbled from the flood,<br/>Since first the leaky ark reposed in mud,<br/>By more or less, are sung in every book,<br/>From Captain Noah down to Captain Cook.<br/>Nor this alone--but, pausing on the road,<br/>The Bard sighs forth a gentle episode,<br/>And gravely tells--attend, each beauteous Miss!--<br/>When first Madeira trembled to a kiss.<br/>Bowles! in thy memory let this precept dwell,<br/>Stick to thy Sonnets, Man!--at least they sell.<br/>But if some new-born whim, or larger bribe,<br/>Prompt thy crude brain, and claim thee for a scribe:<br/>If 'chance some bard, though once by dunces feared,<br/>Now, prone in dust, can only be revered;<br/>If Pope, whose fame and genius, from the first,<br/>Have foiled the best of critics, needs the worst,<br/>Do thou essay: each fault, each failing scan;<br/>The first of poets was, alas! but man.<br/>Rake from each ancient dunghill ev'ry pearl,<br/>Consult Lord Fanny, and confide in CURLL;<br/>Let all the scandals of a former age<br/>Perch on thy pen, and flutter o'er thy page;<br/>Affect a candour which thou canst not feel,<br/>Clothe envy in a garb of honest zeal;<br/>Write, as if St. John's soul could still inspire,<br/>And do from hate what MALLET did for hire.<br/>Oh! hadst thou lived in that congenial time,<br/>To rave with DENNIS, and with RALPH to rhyme;<br/>Thronged with the rest around his living head,<br/>Not raised thy hoof against the lion dead,<br/>A meet reward had crowned thy glorious gains,<br/>And linked thee to the Dunciad for thy pains.<br/><br/>  Another Epic!

ere this the sail<br/>That wafts me hence is shivering in the gale;<br/>And Afric's coast and Calpe's adverse height,<br/>And Stamboul's minarets must greet my sight:<br/>Thence shall I stray through Beauty's native clime,<br/>Where Kaff is clad in rocks, and crowned with snows sublime.<br/>But should I back return, no tempting press<br/>Shall drag my Journal from the desk's recess;<br/>Let coxcombs, printing as they come from far,<br/>Snatch his own wreath of Ridicule from Carr;<br/>Let ABERDEEN and ELGIN still pursue<br/>The shade of fame through regions of Virt√π;<br/>Waste useless thousands on their Phidian freaks,<br/>Misshapen monuments and maimed antiques;<br/>And make their grand saloons a general mart<br/>For all the mutilated blocks of art:<br/>Of Dardan tours let Dilettanti tell,<br/>I leave topography to rapid GELL;<br/>And, quite content, no more shall interpose<br/>To stun the public ear--at least with Prose.<br/><br/>  Thus far I've held my undisturbed career,<br/>Prepared for rancour, steeled 'gainst selfish fear;<br/>This thing of rhyme I ne'er disdained to own--<br/>Though not obtrusive, yet not quite unknown:<br/>My voice was heard again, though not so loud,<br/>My page, though nameless, never disavowed;<br/>And now at once I tear the veil away:--<br/>Cheer on the pack! the Quarry stands at bay,<br/>Unscared by all the din of MELBOURNE house,<br/>By LAMB'S resentment, or by HOLLAND'S spouse,<br/>By JEFFREY'S harmless pistol, HALLAM'S rage,<br/>Edina's brawny sons and brimstone page.<br/>Our men in buckram shall have blows enough,<br/>And feel they too are "penetrable stuff:"<br/>And though I hope not hence unscathed to go,<br/>Who conquers me shall find a stubborn foe.<br/>The time hath been, when no harsh sound would fall<br/>From lips that now may seem imbued with gall;<br/>Nor fools nor follies tempt me to despise<br/>The meanest thing that crawled beneath my eyes:<br/>But now, so callous grown, so changed since youth,<br/>I've learned to think, and sternly speak the truth;<br/>Learned to deride the critic's starch decree,<br/>And break him on the wheel he meant for me;<br/>To spurn the rod a scribbler bids me kiss,<br/>Nor care if courts and crowds applaud or hiss:<br/>Nay more, though all my rival rhymesters frown,<br/>I too can hunt a Poetaster down;<br/>And, armed in proof, the gauntlet cast at once<br/>To Scotch marauder, and to Southern dunce.<br/>Thus much I've dared; if my incondite lay<br/>Hath wronged these righteous times, let others say:<br/>This, let the world, which knows not how to spare,<br/>Yet rarely blames unjustly, now declare.
