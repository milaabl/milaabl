<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Remind Me Not, Remind Me Not by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Remind me not, remind me not,<br/>  Of those beloved, those vanish'd hours,<br/>    When all my soul was given to thee;<br/>Hours that may never be forgot,<br/>  Till Time unnerves our vital powers,<br/>    And thou and I shall cease to be.<br/><br/>Can I forget--canst thou forget,<br/>  When playing with thy golden hair,<br/>    How quick thy fluttering heart did move?<br/>Oh! by my soul, I see thee yet,<br/>  With eyes so languid, breast so fair,<br/>    And lips, though silent, breathing love.<br/><br/>When thus reclining on my breast,<br/> Those eyes threw back a glance so sweet,<br/>    As half reproach'd yet rais'd desire,<br/>And still we near and nearer prest,<br/>  And still our glowing lips would meet,<br/>  As if in kisses to expire.<br/><br/>And then those pensive eyes would close,<br/>  And bid their lids each other seek,<br/>    Veiling the azure orbs below;<br/>While their long lashes' darken'd gloss<br/>  Seem'd stealing o'er thy brilliant cheek,<br/>    Like raven's plumage smooth'd on snow.<br/><br/>I dreamt last night our love return'd,<br/>  And, sooth to say, that very dream<br/>    Was sweeter in its phantasy,<br/>Than if for other hearts I burn'd,<br/>  For eyes that ne'er like thine could beam<br/>    In Rapture's wild reality.<br/><br/>Then tell me not, remind me not,<br/>  Of hours which, though for ever gone,<br/>    Can still a pleasing dream restore,<br/>Till thou and I shall be forgot,<br/>  And senseless, as the mouldering stone<br/>    Which tells that we shall be no more.
</p>
