# üíÆ Young Munro the Sailor by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    'Twas on a sunny morning in the month of May,<br/>I met a pretty damsel on the banks o' the Tay;<br/>I said, My charming fair one, come tell to me I pray,<br/>Why do you walk alone on the banks o' the Tay.<br/><br/>She said, Kind sir, pity me, for I am in great woe<br/>About my young sailor lad, whose name is James Munro;<br/>It's he has been long at sea, seven years from this day,<br/>And I come here sometimes to weep for him that's far, far away.<br/><br/>Lovely creature, cease your weeping and consent to marry me,<br/>And my houses and all my land I will give to thee,<br/>And we shall get married without any delay,<br/>And live happy and contented on the banks o' the Tay.<br/><br/>Believe me, my sweet lady, I pity the sailor's wife,<br/>For I think she must lead a very unhappy life;<br/>Especially on a stormy night, I'm sure she cannot sleep,<br/>Thinking about her husband whilst on the briny deep.<br/><br/>Oh, sir! it is true, what you to me have said,<br/>But I must be content with the choice I've made;<br/>For Munro's he's young and handsome, I will ne'er deny,<br/>And if I don't get him for a husband, believe me, I will die.<br/><br/>Because, when last we parted, we swore to be true,<br/>And I will keep my troth, which lovers ought to do;<br/>And I will pray for his safe return by night and by day,<br/>That God may send him safe home to the banks o' the Tay.<br/><br/>Forgive me, noble heart, for asking to marry you,<br/>I was only trying your love, if it was really true;<br/>But I've found your love is pure towards your sailor lad,<br/>And the thought thereof, believe me, makes my heart feel glad.<br/><br/>As homeward we retraced our steps her heart seemed glad,<br/>In hopes of seeing again her brave sailor lad,<br/>He had promised to marry her when he would return,<br/>So I bade her keep up her spirits and no longer mourn.<br/><br/>Dear creature, the lass that's true to her sweetheart deserves great praise,<br/>And I hope young Munro and you will spend many happy days,<br/>For unto him I know you will ever prove true,<br/>And perchance when he comes home he will marry you.<br/><br/>What you have said, kind sir, I hope will come true,<br/>And if it does, I'll make it known to you;<br/>And you must come to the marriage, which you musn't gainsay,<br/>And dance and rejoice with us on the marriage-day.<br/><br/>When we arrived in Dundee she bade me good-bye,<br/>Then I told her where I lived, while she said with a sigh,<br/>Kind sir, I will long remember that morning in May,<br/>When I met you by chance on the banks o' the Tay.<br/><br/>When three months were past her sailor lad came home,<br/>And she called to see me herself alone,<br/>And she invited me to her marriage without delay,<br/>Which was celebrated with great pomp the next day.<br/><br/>So I went to the marriage with my heart full of joy,<br/>And I wished her prosperity with her sailor boy;<br/>And I danced and sang till daylight, and then came away,<br/>Leaving them happy and contented on the banks o' the Tay.<br/><br/>So all ye pretty fair maids, of high or low degree,<br/>Be faithful to your sweethearts when they have gone to sea,<br/>And never be in doubts of them when they are far away,<br/>Because they might return and marry you some unexpected day.
</p>
