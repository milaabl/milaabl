# üíÆ Niobe in Distress by *Phillis Wheatley*

<p>
    Apollo's wrath to man the dreadful spring<br/>Of ills innum'rous, tuneful goddess, sing!<br/>Thou who did'st first th' ideal pencil give,<br/>And taught'st the painter in his works to live,<br/>Inspire with glowing energy of thought,<br/>What Wilson painted, and what Ovid wrote.<br/>Muse! lend thy aid, nor let me sue in vain,<br/>Tho' last and meanest of the rhyming train!<br/>O guide my pen in lofty strains to show<br/>The Phrygian queen, all beautiful in woe.<br/>'Twas where Maeonia spreads her wide domain<br/>Niobe dwelt, and held her potent reign:<br/>See in her hand the regal sceptre shine,<br/>The wealthy heir of Tantalus divine,<br/>He most distinguish'd by Dodonean Jove,<br/>To approach the tables of the gods above:<br/>Her grandsire Atlas, who with mighty pains<br/>Th' ethereal axis on his neck sustains:<br/>Her other grandsire on the throne on high<br/>Rolls the loud-pealing thunder thro' the sky.<br/><br/>Her spouse, Amphion, who from Jove too springs,<br/>Divinely taught to sweep the sounding strings.<br/><br/>Seven sprightly sons the royal bed adorn,<br/>Seven daughters beauteous as the op'ning morn,<br/>As when Aurora fills the ravish'd sight,<br/>And decks the orient realms with rosy light<br/>From their bright eyes the living splendors play,<br/>Nor can beholders bear the flashing ray.<br/><br/>Wherever, Niobe, thou turn'st thine eyes,<br/>New beauties kindle, and new joys arise!<br/>But thou had'st far the happier mother prov'd,<br/>If this fair offspring had been less belov'd:<br/>What if their charms exceed Aurora's teint.<br/>No words could tell them, and no pencil paint,<br/>Thy love too vehement hastens to destroy<br/>Each blooming maid, and each celestial boy.<br/><br/>Now Manto comes, endu'd with mighty skill,<br/>The past to explore, the future to reveal.<br/>Thro' Thebes' wide streets Tiresia's daughter came,<br/>Divine Latona's mandate to proclaim:<br/>The Theban maids to hear the orders ran,<br/>When thus Maeonia's prophetess began:<br/><br/>"Go, Thebans! great Latona's will obey,<br/>"And pious tribute at her altars pay:<br/>"With rights divine, the goddess be implor'd,<br/>"Nor be her sacred offspring unador'd."<br/>Thus Manto spoke. The Theban maids obey,<br/>And pious tribute to the goddess pay.<br/>The rich perfumes ascend in waving spires,<br/>And altars blaze with consecrated fires;<br/>The fair assembly moves with graceful air,<br/>And leaves of laurel bind the flowing hair.<br/><br/>Niobe comes with all her royal race,<br/>With charms unnumber'd, and superior grace:<br/>Her Phrygian garments of delightful hue,<br/>Inwove with gold, refulgent to the view,<br/>Beyond description beautiful she moves<br/>Like heav'nly Venus, 'midst her smiles and loves:<br/>She views around the supplicating train,<br/>And shakes her graceful head with stern disdain,<br/>Proudly she turns around her lofty eyes,<br/>And thus reviles celestial deities:<br/>"What madness drives the Theban ladies fair<br/>"To give their incense to surrounding air?<br/>"Say why this new sprung deity preferr'd?<br/>"Why vainly fancy your petitions heard?<br/>"Or say why C√¶us offspring is obey'd,<br/>"While to my goddesship no tribute's paid?<br/>"For me no altars blaze with living fires,<br/>"No bullock bleeds, no frankincense transpires,<br/>"Tho' Cadmus' palace, not unknown to fame,<br/>"And Phrygian nations all revere my name.<br/>"Where'er I turn my eyes vast wealth I find,<br/>"Lo! here an empress with a goddess join'd.<br/>"What, shall a Titaness be deify'd,<br/>"To whom the spacious earth a couch deny'd!<br/>"Nor heav'n, nor earth, nor sea receiv'd your queen,<br/>"Till pitying Delos took the wand'rer in.<br/>"Round me what a large progeny is spread!<br/>"No frowns of fortune has my soul to dread.<br/>"What if indignant she decrease my train<br/>"More than Latona's number will remain;<br/>"Then hence, ye Theban dames, hence haste away,<br/>"Nor longer off'rings to Latona pay;<br/>"Regard the orders of Amphion's spouse,<br/>"And take the leaves of laurel from your brows."<br/>Niobe spoke. The Theban maids obey'd,<br/>Their brows unbound, and left the rights unpaid.<br/><br/>The angry goddess heard, then silence broke<br/>On Cynthus' summit, and indignant spoke;<br/>"Phoebus! behold, thy mother in disgrace,<br/>"Who to no goddess yields the prior place<br/>"Except to Juno's self, who reigns above,<br/>"The spouse and sister of the thund'ring Jove.<br/>"Niobe, sprung from Tantalus, inspires<br/>"Each Theban bosom with rebellious fires;<br/>"No reason her imperious temper quells,<br/>"But all her father in her tongue rebels;<br/>"Wrap her own sons for her blaspheming breath,<br/>"Apollo! wrap them in the shades of death."<br/>Latona ceas'd, and ardent thus replies<br/>The God, whose glory decks th' expanded skies.<br/><br/>"Cease thy complaints, mine be the task assign'd<br/>"To punish pride, and scourge the rebel mind."<br/>This Phoebe join'd.--They wing their instant flight;<br/>Thebes trembled as th' immortal pow'rs alight.<br/><br/>With clouds incompass'd glorious Phoebus stands;<br/>The feather'd vengeance quiv'ring in his hands.<br/><br/>Near Cadmus' walls a plain extended lay,<br/>Where Thebes' young princes pass'd in sport the day:<br/>There the bold coursers bounded o'er the plains,<br/>While their great masters held the golden reins.<br/>Ismenus first the racing pastime led,<br/>And rul'd the fury of his flying steed.<br/>"Ah me," he sudden cries, with shrieking breath,<br/>While in his breast he feels the shaft of death;<br/>He drops the bridle on his courser's mane,<br/>Before his eyes in shadows swims the plain,<br/>He, the first-born of great Amphion's bed,<br/>Was struck the first, first mingled with the dead.<br/><br/>Then didst thou, Sipylus, the language hear<br/>Of fate portentous whistling in the air:<br/>As when th' impending storm the sailor sees<br/>He spreads his canvas to the fav'ring breeze,<br/>So to thine horse thou gav'st the golden reins,<br/>Gav'st him to rush impetuous o'er the plains:<br/>But ah! a fatal shaft from Phoebus' hand<br/>Smites thro' thy neck, and sinks thee on the sand.<br/><br/>Two other brothers were at wrestling found,<br/>And in their pastime claspt each other round:<br/>A shaft that instant from Apollo's hand<br/>Transfixt them both, and stretcht them on the sand:<br/>Together they their cruel fate bemoan'd,<br/>Together languish'd, and together groan'd:<br/>Together too th' unbodied spirits fled,<br/>And sought the gloomy mansions of the dead.<br/>Alphenor saw, and trembling at the view,<br/>Beat his torn breast, that chang'd its snowy hue.<br/>He flies to raise them in a kind embrace;<br/>A brother's fondness triumphs in his face:<br/>Alphenor fails in this fraternal deed,<br/>A dart dispatch'd him (so the fates decreed<br/>Soon as the arrow left the deadly wound,<br/>His issuing entrails smoak'd upon the ground.<br/>What woes on blooming Damasichon wait!<br/>His sighs portend his near impending fate.<br/>Just where the well-made leg begins to be,<br/>And the soft sinews form the supple knee,<br/>The youth sore wounded by the Delian god<br/>Attempts t' extract the crime-avenging rod,<br/>But, whilst he strives the will of fate t' avert,<br/>Divine Apollo sends a second dart;<br/>Swift thro' his throat the feather'd mischief flies,<br/>Bereft of sense, he drops his head, and dies.<br/><br/>Young Ilioneus, the last, directs his pray'r,<br/>And cries, "My life, ye gods celestial! spare."<br/>Apollo heard, and pity touch'd his heart,<br/>But ah! too late, for he had sent the dart:<br/>Thou too, O Ilioneus, art doom'd to fall,<br/>The fates refuse that arrow to recal.<br/><br/>On the swift wings of ever flying Fame<br/>To Cadmus' palace soon the tidings came:<br/>Niobe heard, and with indignant eyes<br/>She thus express'd her anger and surprise:<br/>"Why is such privilege to them allow'd?<br/>"Why thus insulted by the Delian god?<br/>"Dwells there such mischief in the pow'rs above?<br/>"Why sleeps the vengeance of immortal Jove?"<br/>For now Amphion too, with grief oppress'd,<br/>Had plung'd the deadly dagger in his breast.<br/>Niobe now, less haughty than before,<br/>With lofty head directs her steps no more<br/>She, who late told her pedigree divine,<br/>And drove the Thebans from Latona's shrine,<br/>How strangely chang'd!--yet beautiful in woe,<br/>She weeps, nor weeps unpity'd by the foe.<br/>On each pale corse the wretched mother spread<br/>Lay overwhelm'd with grief, and kiss'd her dead,<br/>Then rais'd her arms, and thus, in accents slow,<br/>"Be sated cruel Goddess! with my woe;<br/>"If I've offended, let these streaming eyes,<br/>"And let this sev'nfold funeral suffice:<br/>"Ah! take this wretched life you deign'd to save,<br/>"With them I too am carried to the grave.<br/>"Rejoice triumphant, my victorious foe,<br/>"But show the cause from whence your triumphs flow?<br/>"Tho' I unhappy mourn these children slain,<br/>"Yet greater numbers to my lot remain."<br/>She ceas'd, the bow string twang'd with awful sound,<br/>Which struck with terror all th' assembly round,<br/>Except the queen, who stood unmov'd alone,<br/>By her distresses more presumptuous grown.<br/>Near the pale corses stood their sisters fair<br/>In sable vestures and dishevell'd hair;<br/>One, while she draws the fatal shaft away,<br/>Faints, falls, and sickens at the light of day.<br/>To sooth her mother, lo! another flies,<br/>And blames the fury of inclement skies,<br/>And, while her words a filial pity show,<br/>Struck dumb--indignant seeks the shades below.<br/>Now from the fatal place another flies,<br/>Falls in her flight, and languishes, and dies.<br/>Another on her sister drops in death;<br/>A fifth in trembling terrors yields her breath;<br/>While the sixth seeks some gloomy cave in vain,<br/>Struck with the rest, and mingled with the slain.<br/><br/>One only daughter lives, and she the least;<br/>The queen close clasp'd the daughter to her breast:<br/>"Ye heav'nly pow'rs, ah spare me one," she cry'd,<br/>"Ah! spare me one," the vocal hills reply'd:<br/>In vain she begs, the Fates her suit deny,<br/>In her embrace she sees her daughter die.<br/><br/>*"The queen of all her family bereft,<br/>"Without or husband, son, or daughter left,<br/>"Grew stupid at the shock. The passing air<br/>"Made no impression on her stiff'ning hair.<br/>"The blood forsook her face: amidst the flood<br/>"Pour'd from her cheeks, quite fix'd her eye-balls stood.<br/>"Her tongue, her palate both obdurate grew,<br/>"Her curdled veins no longer motion knew;<br/>"The use of neck, and arms, and feet was gone,<br/>"And ev'n her bowels hard'ned into stone:<br/>"A marble statue now the queen appears,<br/>"But from the marble steal the silent tears."
