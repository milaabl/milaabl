  <summary>üìö <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> üëá </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Translation From Anacreon. Ode 3 by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    'Twas now the hour when Night had driven<br/>Her car half round yon sable heaven;<br/>Bo√∂tes, only, seem'd to roll<br/>His Arctic charge around the Pole;<br/>While mortals, lost in gentle sleep,<br/>Forgot to smile, or ceas'd to weep:<br/>At this lone hour the Paphian boy,<br/>Descending from the realms of joy,<br/>Quick to my gate directs his course,<br/>And knocks with all his little force;<br/>My visions fled, alarm'd I rose,--<br/>"What stranger breaks my blest repose?"<br/>"Alas!" replies the wily child<br/>In faltering accents sweetly mild;<br/>"A hapless Infant here I roam,<br/>Far from my dear maternal home.<br/>Oh! shield me from the wintry blast!<br/>The nightly storm is pouring fast.<br/>No prowling robber lingers here;<br/>A wandering baby who can fear?"<br/>I heard his seeming artless tale,<br/>I heard his sighs upon the gale:<br/>My breast was never pity's foe,<br/>But felt for all the baby's woe.<br/>I drew the bar, and by the light<br/>Young Love, the infant, met my sight;<br/>His bow across his shoulders flung,<br/>And thence his fatal quiver hung<br/>(Ah! little did I think the dart<br/>Would rankle soon within my heart).<br/>With care I tend my weary guest,<br/>His little fingers chill my breast;<br/>His glossy curls, his azure wing,<br/>Which droop with nightly showers, I wring;<br/>His shivering limbs the embers warm;<br/>And now reviving from the storm,<br/>Scarce had he felt his wonted glow,<br/>Than swift he seized his slender bow:--<br/>"I fain would know, my gentle host,"<br/>He cried, "if this its strength has lost;<br/>I fear, relax'd with midnight dews,<br/>The strings their former aid refuse."<br/>With poison tipt, his arrow flies,<br/>Deep in my tortur'd heart it lies:<br/>Then loud the joyous Urchin laugh'd:--<br/>"My bow can still impel the shaft:<br/>'Tis firmly fix'd, thy sighs reveal it;<br/>Say, courteous host, canst thou not feel it?"
</p>
