# üíÆ Epilogue to the Satires. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    IN TWO DIALOGUES.<br/><br/>DIALOGUE I.<br/><br/>_Fr_. Not twice a twelvemonth you appear in print,<br/>And when it comes, the court see nothing in 't.<br/>You grow correct, that once with rapture writ,<br/>And are, besides, too moral for a wit.<br/>Decay of parts, alas! we all must feel--<br/>Why now, this moment, don't I see you steal?<br/>'Tis all from Horace; Horace long before ye<br/>Said, 'Tories call'd him Whig, and Whigs a Tory;'<br/>And taught his Romans, in much better metre,<br/>'To laugh at fools who put their trust in Peter.'<br/><br/>But, Horace, sir, was delicate, was nice;<br/>Bubo observes, he lash'd no sort of vice:<br/>Horace would say, Sir Billy served the crown,<br/>Blunt could do business, Huggins knew the town;<br/>In Sappho touch the failings of the sex,<br/>In reverend bishops note some small neglects,<br/>And own, the Spaniard did a waggish thing,<br/>Who cropp'd our ears, and sent them to the king.<br/>His sly, polite, insinuating style<br/>Could please at court, and make Augustus smile:<br/>An artful manager, that crept between<br/>His friend and shame, and was a kind of screen.<br/>But, faith, your very friends will soon be sore;<br/>Patriots there are, who wish you'd jest no more--<br/>And where's the glory? 'twill be only thought<br/>The great man never offer'd you a groat.<br/>Go see Sir Robert--<br/><br/>_P_.            See Sir Robert!--hum--<br/>And never laugh--for all my life to come?<br/>Seen him I have, but in his happier hour<br/>Of social pleasure, ill-exchanged for power;<br/>Seen him, uncumber'd with the venal tribe,<br/>Smile without art, and win without a bribe.<br/>Would he oblige me? let me only find,<br/>He does not think me what he thinks mankind.<br/>Come, come, at all I laugh he laughs, no doubt;<br/>The only difference is, I dare laugh out.<br/><br/>_F_. Why, yes: with Scripture still you may be free;<br/>A horse-laugh, if you please, at honesty;<br/>A joke on Jekyl, or some odd old Whig<br/>Who never changed his principle, or wig:<br/>A patriot is a fool in every age,<br/>Whom all Lord Chamberlains allow the stage:<br/>These nothing hurts; they keep their fashion still,<br/>And wear their strange old virtue, as they will.<br/><br/>If any ask you, 'Who's the man, so near<br/>His prince, that writes in verse, and has his ear?'<br/>Why, answer, Lyttleton, and I'll engage<br/>The worthy youth shall ne'er be in a rage:<br/>But were his verses vile, his whisper base,<br/>You'd quickly find him in Lord Fanny's case.<br/>Sejanus, Wolsey, hurt not honest Fleury,<br/>But well may put some statesmen in a fury.<br/><br/>Laugh then at any, but at fools or foes;<br/>These you but anger, and you mend not those.<br/>Laugh at your friends, and, if your friends are sore,<br/>So much the better, you may laugh the more.<br/>To vice and folly to confine the jest,<br/>Sets half the world, God knows, against the rest;<br/>Did not the sneer of more impartial men<br/>At sense and virtue, balance all again.<br/>Judicious wits spread wide the ridicule,<br/>And charitably comfort knave and fool.<br/><br/>_P_. Dear sir, forgive the prejudice of youth:<br/>Adieu distinction, satire, warmth, and truth!<br/>Come, harmless characters that no one hit;<br/>Come, Henley's oratory, Osborn's wit!<br/>The honey dropping from Favonio's tongue,<br/>The flowers of Bubo, and the flow of Yonge!<br/>The gracious dew of pulpit eloquence,<br/>And all the well-whipt cream of courtly sense,<br/>That first was Hervy's, Fox's next, and then<br/>The senate's, and then Hervy's once again.<br/>Oh come, that easy, Ciceronian style,<br/>So Latin, yet so English all the while,<br/>As, though the pride of Middleton and Bland,<br/>All boys may read, and girls may understand!<br/>Then might I sing, without the least offence,<br/>And all I sung should be the nation's sense;<br/>Or teach the melancholy Muse to mourn,<br/>Hang the sad verse on Carolina's urn,<br/>And hail her passage to the realms of rest,<br/>All parts perform'd, and all her children bless'd!<br/>So--satire is no more--I feel it die--<br/>No gazetteer more innocent than I--<br/>And let, a-God's-name! every fool and knave<br/>Be graced through life, and flatter'd in his grave.<br/><br/>_F_. Why so? if satire knows its time and place,<br/>You still may lash the greatest--in disgrace:<br/>For merit will by turns forsake them all;<br/>Would you know when exactly when they fall.<br/>But let all satire in all changes spare<br/>Immortal Selkirk, and grave Delaware.<br/>Silent and soft, as saints remove to heaven,<br/>All ties dissolved, and every sin forgiven,<br/>These may some gentle ministerial wing<br/>Receive, and place for ever near a king!<br/>There, where no passion, pride, or shame transport,<br/>Lull'd with the sweet nepenthe of a court;<br/>There, where no father's, brother's, friend's disgrace<br/>Once break their rest, or stir them from their place:<br/>But past the sense of human miseries,<br/>All tears are wiped for ever from all eyes;<br/>No cheek is known to blush, no heart to throb,<br/>Save when they lose a question, or a job.<br/><br/>_P_. Good Heaven forbid that I should blast their glory,<br/>Who know how like Whig ministers to Tory,<br/>And when three sovereigns died, could scarce be vex'd,<br/>Considering what a gracious prince was next.<br/>Have I, in silent wonder, seen such things<br/>As pride in slaves, and avarice in kings;<br/>And at a peer, or peeress, shall I fret,<br/>Who starves a sister, or forswears a debt?<br/>Virtue, I grant you, is an empty boast;<br/>But shall the dignity of vice be lost?<br/>Ye gods! shall Cibber's son, without rebuke,<br/>Swear like a lord, or Rich out-whore a duke?<br/>A favourite's porter with his master vie,<br/>Be bribed as often, and as often lie?<br/>Shall Ward draw contracts with a statesman's skill?<br/>Or Japhet pocket, like his Grace, a will?<br/>Is it for Bond, or Peter, (paltry things)<br/>To pay their debts, or keep their faith, like kings?<br/>If Blount dispatch'd himself, he play'd the man,<br/>And so may'st thou, illustrious Passeran!<br/>But shall a printer, weary of his life,<br/>Learn from their books to hang himself and wife?<br/>This, this, my friend, I cannot, must not bear:<br/>Vice thus abused, demands a nation's care:<br/>This calls the Church to deprecate our sin,<br/>And hurls the thunder of the laws on gin,<br/>Let modest Foster, if he will, excel<br/>Ten metropolitans in preaching well;<br/>A simple Quaker, or a Quaker's wife,<br/>Outdo Landaff in doctrine,--yea, in life:<br/>Let humble Allen, with an awkward shame,<br/>Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.<br/>Virtue may choose the high or low degree,<br/>'Tis just alike to virtue, and to me;<br/>Dwell in a monk, or light upon a king,<br/>She's still the same beloved, contented thing.<br/>Vice is undone, if she forgets her birth,<br/>And stoops from angels to the dregs of earth:<br/>But 'tis the fall degrades her to a whore;<br/>Let greatness own her, and she's mean no more:<br/>Her birth, her beauty, crowds and courts confess,<br/>Chaste matrons praise her, and grave bishops bless:<br/>In golden chains the willing world she draws,<br/>And hers the gospel is, and hers the laws,<br/>Mounts the tribunal, lifts her scarlet head,<br/>And sees pale virtue carted in her stead.<br/>Lo! at the wheels of her triumphal car,<br/>Old England's genius, rough with many a scar,<br/>Dragg'd in the dust! his arms hang idly round,<br/>His flag inverted trails along the ground!<br/>Our youth, all liveried o'er with foreign gold,<br/>Before her dance: behind her, crawl the old!<br/>See thronging millions to the pagod run,<br/>And offer country, parent, wife, or son!<br/>Hear her black trumpet through the land proclaim,<br/>That NOT TO BE CORRUPTED IS THE SHAME!<br/>In soldier, churchman, patriot, man in power,<br/>'Tis avarice all, ambition is no more!<br/>See, all our nobles begging to be slaves!<br/>See, all our fools aspiring to be knaves!<br/>The wit of cheats, the courage of a whore,<br/>Are what ten thousand envy and adore!<br/>All, all look up with reverential awe,<br/>At crimes that 'scape, or triumph o'er the law:<br/>While truth, worth, wisdom, daily they decry--<br/>'Nothing is sacred now but villany.'<br/><br/>Yet may this verse (if such a verse remain)<br/>Show, there was one who held it in disdain.<br/><br/>DIALOGUE II.<br/><br/>_Fr_. 'Tis all a libel--Paxton (sir) will say.<br/><br/>_P_. Not yet, my friend! to-morrow, faith, it may;<br/>And for that very cause I print to-day.<br/>How should I fret to mangle every line,<br/>In reverence to the sins of thirty-nine!<br/>Vice with such giant strides comes on amain,<br/>Invention strives to be before in vain;<br/>Feign what I will, and paint it e'er so strong,<br/>Some rising genius sins up to my song.<br/><br/>_F_. Yet none but you by name the guilty lash;<br/>Ev'n Guthrie saves half Newgate by a dash.<br/>Spare then the person, and expose the vice.<br/><br/>_P_. How, sir! not damn the sharper, but the dice?<br/>Come on then, Satire! general, unconfined,<br/>Spread thy broad wing, and souse on all the kind.<br/>Ye statesmen, priests, of one religion all!<br/>Ye tradesmen, vile, in army, court, or hall!<br/>Ye reverend atheists----<br/><br/>_F_.             Scandal! name them, who?<br/><br/>_P_. Why that's the thing you bid me not to do.<br/>Who starved a sister, who forswore a debt,<br/>I never named; the town's inquiring yet.<br/>The poisoning dame----<br/><br/>_F_.          You mean----<br/><br/>_P_.                   I don't.<br/><br/>_F_.                            You do.<br/><br/>_P_. See, now I keep the secret, and not you!<br/>The bribing statesman----<br/><br/>_F_.              Hold, too high you go.<br/><br/>_P_. The bribed elector----<br/><br/>_F_.                    There you stoop too low.<br/><br/>_P_. I fain would please you, if I knew with what;<br/>Tell me, which knave is lawful game, which not?<br/>Must great offenders, once escaped the crown,<br/>Like royal harts, be never more run down?<br/>Admit, your law to spare the knight requires,<br/>As beasts of nature may we hunt the 'squires?<br/>Suppose I censure--you know what I mean--<br/>To save a bishop, may I name a dean?<br/><br/>_F_. A dean, sir? no: his fortune is not made,<br/>You hurt a man that's rising in the trade.<br/><br/>_P_. If not the tradesman who set up to-day,<br/>Much less the 'prentice who to-morrow may.<br/>Down, down, proud Satire! though a realm be spoil'd,<br/>Arraign no mightier thief than wretched Wild;<br/>Or, if a court or country's made a job,<br/>Go drench a pickpocket, and join the mob.<br/><br/>But, sir, I beg you (for the love of vice!)<br/>The matter's weighty, pray consider twice;<br/>Have you less pity for the needy cheat,<br/>The poor and friendless villain, than the great?<br/>Alas! the small discredit of a bribe<br/>Scarce hurts the lawyer, but undoes the scribe.<br/>Then better, sure, it charity becomes<br/>To tax directors, who (thank God) have plums;<br/>Still better, ministers; or, if the thing<br/>May pinch ev'n there--why lay it on a king.<br/><br/>_F._ Stop! stop!<br/><br/>_P._        Must Satire, then, nor rise nor fall?<br/>Speak out, and bid me blame no rogues at all.<br/><br/>_F._ Yes, strike that Wild, I'll justify the blow.<br/><br/>_P._ Strike! why the man was hanged ten years ago:<br/>Who now that obsolete example fears?<br/>Ev'n Peter trembles only for his ears.<br/><br/>_F._ What, always Peter! Peter thinks you mad,<br/>You make men desperate if they once are bad:<br/>Else might he take to virtue some years hence<br/><br/>_P._ As Selkirk, if he lives, will love the Prince.<br/><br/>_F._ Strange spleen to Selkirk!<br/><br/>_P._                     Do I wrong the man?<br/>God knows, I praise a courtier where I can.<br/>When I confess, there is who feels for fame,<br/>And melts to goodness, need I Scarb'rough name?<br/>Pleased, let me own, in Esher's peaceful grove<br/>(Where Kent and nature vie for Pelham's love)<br/>The scene, the master, opening to my view,<br/>I sit and dream I see my Craggs anew!<br/>Ev'n in a bishop I can spy desert;<br/>Secker is decent--Rundel has a heart--<br/>Manners with candour are to Benson given--<br/>To Berkeley, every virtue under heaven.<br/><br/>But does the court a worthy man remove?<br/>That instant, I declare, he has my love:<br/>I shun his zenith, court his mild decline;<br/>Thus Somers once, and Halifax, were mine.<br/>Oft, in the clear, still mirror of retreat,<br/>I studied Shrewsbury, the wise and great:<br/>Carleton's calm sense, and Stanhope's noble flame,<br/>Compared, and knew their generous end the same:<br/>How pleasing Atterbury's softer hour!<br/>How shined the soul, unconquer'd in the Tower!<br/>How can I Pulteney, Chesterfield, forget,<br/>While Roman spirit charms, and Attic wit:<br/>Argyll, the state's whole thunder born to wield,<br/>And shake alike the senate and the field:<br/>Or Wyndham, just to freedom and the throne,<br/>The master of our passions, and his own.<br/>Names, which I long have loved, nor loved in vain,<br/>Rank'd with their friends, not number'd with their train:<br/>And if yet higher the proud list should end,<br/>Still let me say,--No follower, but a friend.<br/><br/>Yet think not Friendship only prompts my lays;<br/>I follow Virtue; where she shines, I praise:<br/>Point she to priest or elder, Whig or Tory,<br/>Or round a Quaker's beaver cast a glory.<br/>I never (to my sorrow I declare)<br/>Dined with the Man of Ross, or my Lord Mayor.<br/>Some, in their choice of friends, (nay, look not grave) 100<br/>Have still a secret bias to a knave:<br/>To find an honest man I beat about.<br/>And love him, court him, praise him, in or out.<br/><br/>_F_. Then why so few commended?<br/><br/>_P_.                          Not so fierce;<br/>Find you the virtue, and I'll find the verse.<br/>But random praise--the task can ne'er be done;<br/>Each mother asks it for her booby son,<br/>Each widow asks it for 'the best of men,'<br/>For him she weeps, and him she weds again.<br/>Praise cannot stoop, like satire, to the ground;<br/>The number may be hang'd, but not be crown'd.<br/>Enough for half the greatest of these days,<br/>To 'scape my censure, not expect my praise.<br/>Are they not rich? what more can they pretend?<br/>Dare they to hope a poet for their friend?<br/>What Richelieu wanted, Louis scarce could gain,<br/>And what young Ammon wish'd, but wish'd in vain.<br/>No power the Muse's friendship can command;<br/>No power, when Virtue claims it, can withstand:<br/>To Cato, Virgil paid one honest line;<br/>Oh let my country's friends illumine mine!<br/>--What are you thinking?<br/><br/>_F_.              Faith, the thought's no sin--<br/>I think your friends are out, and would be in.<br/><br/>_P_. If merely to come in, sir, they go out,<br/>The way they take is strangely round about.<br/><br/>_F_. They too may be corrupted, you'll allow?<br/><br/>_P_. I only call those knaves who are so now.<br/>Is that too little? Come then, I'll comply--<br/>Spirit of Arnall! aid me while I lie.<br/>Cobham's a coward, Polwarth is a slave,<br/>And Lyttleton a dark, designing knave,<br/>St John has ever been a wealthy fool--<br/>But let me add, Sir Robert's mighty dull,<br/>Has never made a friend in private life,<br/>And was, besides, a tyrant to his wife.<br/><br/>But pray, when others praise him, do I blame?<br/>Call Verres, Wolsey, any odious name?<br/>Why rail they then, if but a wreath of mine,<br/>O all-accomplish'd St John! deck thy shrine?<br/><br/>What! shall each spur-gall'd hackney of the day,<br/>When Paxton gives him double pots and pay,<br/>Or each new-pension'd sycophant, pretend<br/>To break my windows if I treat a friend?<br/>Then wisely plead, to me they meant no hurt,<br/>But 'twas my guest at whom they threw the dirt?<br/>Sure, if I spare the minister, no rules<br/>Of honour bind me, not to maul his tools;<br/>Sure, if they cannot cut, it may be said<br/>His saws are toothless, and his hatchet's lead.<br/><br/>It anger'd Turenne, once upon a day,<br/>To see a footman kick'd that took his pay:<br/>But when he heard the affront the fellow gave,<br/>Knew one a man of honour, one a knave,<br/>The prudent general turn'd it to a jest,<br/>And begg'd he'd take the pains to kick the rest:<br/>Which not at present having time to do----<br/><br/>_F_. Hold sir! for God's-sake where 'a the affront to you?<br/>Against your worship when had Selkirk writ?<br/>Or Page pour'd forth the torrent of his wit?<br/>Or grant the bard whose distich all commend<br/>'In power a servant, out of power a friend,'<br/>To Walpole guilty of some venial sin;<br/>What's that to you who ne'er was out nor in?<br/><br/>The priest whose flattery bedropp'd the crown,<br/>How hurt he you? he only stain'd the gown.<br/>And how did, pray, the florid youth offend,<br/>Whose speech you took, and gave it to a friend?<br/><br/>_P_. Faith, it imports not much from whom it came;<br/>Whoever borrow'd, could not be to blame,<br/>Since the whole house did afterwards the same.<br/>Let courtly wits to wits afford supply,<br/>As hog to hog in huts of Westphaly;<br/>If one, through Nature's bounty, or his lord's,<br/>Has what the frugal, dirty soil affords,<br/>From him the next receives it, thick or thin,<br/>As pure a mess almost as it came in;<br/>The blessed benefit, not there confined,<br/>Drops to the third, who nuzzles close behind;<br/>From tail to mouth, they feed and they carouse:<br/>The last full fairly gives it to the House.<br/><br/>_F_. This filthy simile, this beastly line<br/>Quite turns my stomach----<br/><br/>_P_.               So does flattery mine;<br/>And all your courtly civet-cats can vent,<br/>Perfume to you, to me is excrement.<br/>But hear me further--Japhet, 'tis agreed,<br/>Writ not, and Chartres scarce could write or read,<br/>In all the courts of Pindus guiltless quite;<br/>But pens can forge, my friend, that cannot write;<br/>And must no egg in Japhet's face be thrown,<br/>Because the deed he forged was not my own?<br/>Must never patriot then declaim at gin,<br/>Unless, good man! he has been fairly in?<br/>No zealous pastor blame a failing spouse,<br/>Without a staring reason on his brows?<br/>And each blasphemer quite escape the rod,<br/>Because the insult's not on man, but God?<br/><br/>Ask you what provocation I have had?<br/>The strong antipathy of good to bad.<br/>When truth or virtue an affront endures,<br/>The affront is mine, my friend, and should be yours.<br/>Mine, as a foe profess'd to false pretence,<br/>Who think a coxcomb's honour like his sense;<br/>Mine, as a friend to every worthy mind;<br/>And mine, as man, who feel for all mankind.<br/><br/>_F_. You're strangely proud.<br/><br/>_P_.                    So proud, I am no slave:<br/>So impudent, I own myself no knave:<br/>So odd, my country's ruin makes me grave.<br/>Yes, I am proud; I must be proud to see<br/>Men not afraid of God, afraid of me:<br/>Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,<br/>Yet touch'd and shamed by ridicule alone.<br/><br/>O sacred weapon! left for truth's defence,<br/>Sole dread of folly, vice, and insolence!<br/>To all but heaven-directed hands denied,<br/>The Muse may give thee, but the gods must guide:<br/>Rev'rent I touch thee! but with honest zeal;<br/>To rouse the watchmen of the public weal,<br/>To virtue's work provoke the tardy Hall,<br/>And goad the prelate slumbering in his stall.<br/>Ye tinsel insects! whom a court maintains,<br/>That counts your beauties only by your stains,<br/>Spin all your cobwebs o'er the eye of day!<br/>The Muse's wing shall brush you all away:<br/>All his grace preaches, all his lordship sings,<br/>All that makes saints of queens, and gods of kings,--<br/>All, all but truth, drops dead-born from the press,<br/>Like the last gazette, or the last address.<br/><br/>When black ambition stains a public cause,<br/>A monarch's sword when mad vain-glory draws,<br/>Not Waller's wreath can hide the nation's scar,<br/>Nor Boileau turn the feather to a star.<br/><br/>Not so, when, diadem'd with rays divine,<br/>Touch'd with the flame that breaks from Virtue's shrine,<br/>Her priestess Muse forbids the good to die,<br/>And opes the temple of Eternity.<br/>There, other trophies deck the truly brave,<br/>Than such as Anstis casts into the grave;<br/>Far other stars than ---- and ---- wear,<br/>And may descend to Mordington from Stair:<br/>(Such as on Hough's unsullied mitre shine,<br/>Or beam, good Digby, from a heart like thine)<br/>Let Envy howl, while Heaven's whole chorus sings,<br/>And bark at honour not conferr'd by kings;<br/>Let Flattery sickening see the incense rise,<br/>Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies:<br/>Truth guards the poet, sanctifies the line,<br/>And makes immortal verse as mean as mine.<br/><br/>Yes, the last pen for freedom let me draw,<br/>When truth stands trembling on the edge of law;<br/>Here, last of Britons! let your names be read;<br/>Are none, none living? let me praise the dead,<br/>And for that cause which made your fathers shine,<br/>Fall by the votes of their degenerate line.<br/><br/>_F_. Alas! alas! pray end what you began,<br/>And write next winter more 'Essays on Man.'
