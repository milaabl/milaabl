# üíÆ Lost in the Prairie by *William Topaz McGonagall*

<p>
    In one of fhe States of America, some years ago,<br/>There suddenly came on a violent storm of snow,<br/>Which was nearly the death of a party of workmen,<br/>Who had finished their day's work - nine or ten of them.<br/><br/>The distance was nearly twenty miles to their camp,<br/>And with the thick falling snow their clothes felt damp,<br/>As they set out for their camp, which was in a large grove,<br/>And to reach it, manfully against the storm they strove.<br/><br/>The wind blew very hard, and the snow was falling fast,<br/>Still, they plodded on, but felt a little downcast,<br/>And the snow fell so fast they could scarcely see,<br/>And they began to think they were lost on the wild prairie.<br/><br/>And they suddenly noticed marks of footsteps in the snow,<br/>Which they found were their own tracks, as onward they did go,<br/>Then they knew they were lost on the great prairie,<br/>And what could they do in such a fearful extremity?<br/><br/>Then their hearts began to sink with woe,<br/>In dread of having to pass the night in the snow,<br/>And they cried, "Oh, God help us to find our way,<br/>Or else we are lost on the lonely prairie."<br/><br/>And while they stood shivering with the cold,<br/>One of the party a particular horse did behold,<br/>Which was known by the name of Old Jack,<br/>So to take off his bridle they were not slack.<br/><br/>When the horse was let free he threw up his head and tail,<br/>Which seemed to say, "Follow ms, and ye will not fail.<br/>So come on, boys, and follow me,<br/>And I'll guide ye home safely."<br/><br/>And they cried, " Old Jack can show us the way,<br/>So let's follow his tracks without dismay";<br/>And with the falling snow they were chilled to the bone,<br/>But the horse seemed to say, "I'll show ye home."<br/><br/>And at last they gave a shout of delight<br/>When they saw their camp fire burning bright,<br/>Which was to them a cheerful sight,<br/>And they caressed Old Jack for guiding them home that night.<br/><br/>And they felt thankful to God for their safety,<br/>And they danced around Old Jack with their hearts full of glee,<br/>And Old Jack became a favourite from that day,<br/>Because he saved them from being lost on the wild prairie.
