# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 01 by *John Milton*

<p>
    Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit<br/>Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste<br/>Brought death into the World, and all our woe,<br/>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man<br/>Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,<br/>Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top<br/>Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire<br/>That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed<br/>In the beginning how the heavens and earth<br/>Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill<br/>Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed<br/>Fast by the oracle of God, I thence<br/>Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,<br/>That with no middle flight intends to soar<br/>Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues<br/>Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.<br/>And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer<br/>Before all temples th' upright heart and pure,<br/>Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first<br/>Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,<br/>Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss,<br/>And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark<br/>Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br/>That, to the height of this great argument,<br/>I may assert Eternal Providence,<br/>And justify the ways of God to men.<br/>  Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,<br/>Nor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause<br/>Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,<br/>Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off<br/>From their Creator, and transgress his will<br/>For one restraint, lords of the World besides.<br/>Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?<br/>  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,<br/>Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived<br/>The mother of mankind, what time his pride<br/>Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host<br/>Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring<br/>To set himself in glory above his peers,<br/>He trusted to have equalled the Most High,<br/>If he opposed, and with ambitious aim<br/>Against the throne and monarchy of God,<br/>Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,<br/>With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power<br/>Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky,<br/>With hideous ruin and combustion, down<br/>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br/>In adamantine chains and penal fire,<br/>Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.<br/>  Nine times the space that measures day and night<br/>To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,<br/>Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,<br/>Confounded, though immortal. But his doom<br/>Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought<br/>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br/>Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,<br/>That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,<br/>Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.<br/>At once, as far as Angels ken, he views<br/>The dismal situation waste and wild.<br/>A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,<br/>As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames<br/>No light; but rather darkness visible<br/>Served only to discover sights of woe,<br/>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br/>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br/>That comes to all, but torture without end<br/>Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed<br/>With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.<br/>Such place Eternal Justice has prepared<br/>For those rebellious; here their prison ordained<br/>In utter darkness, and their portion set,<br/>As far removed from God and light of Heaven<br/>As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole.<br/>Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br/>There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed<br/>With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br/>He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,<br/>One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br/>Long after known in Palestine, and named<br/>Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,<br/>And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words<br/>Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:--<br/>  "If thou beest he--but O how fallen! how changed<br/>From him who, in the happy realms of light<br/>Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine<br/>Myriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league,<br/>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope<br/>And hazard in the glorious enterprise<br/>Joined with me once, now misery hath joined<br/>In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest<br/>From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved<br/>He with his thunder; and till then who knew<br/>The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,<br/>Nor what the potent Victor in his rage<br/>Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,<br/>Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,<br/>And high disdain from sense of injured merit,<br/>That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,<br/>And to the fierce contentions brought along<br/>Innumerable force of Spirits armed,<br/>That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,<br/>His utmost power with adverse power opposed<br/>In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,<br/>And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?<br/>All is not lost--the unconquerable will,<br/>And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/>And courage never to submit or yield:<br/>And what is else not to be overcome?<br/>That glory never shall his wrath or might<br/>Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace<br/>With suppliant knee, and deify his power<br/>Who, from the terror of this arm, so late<br/>Doubted his empire--that were low indeed;<br/>That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br/>This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,<br/>And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail;<br/>Since, through experience of this great event,<br/>In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,<br/>We may with more successful hope resolve<br/>To wage by force or guile eternal war,<br/>Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,<br/>Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy<br/>Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven."<br/>  So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain,<br/>Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;<br/>And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:--<br/>  "O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers<br/>That led th' embattled Seraphim to war<br/>Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds<br/>Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King,<br/>And put to proof his high supremacy,<br/>Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,<br/>Too well I see and rue the dire event<br/>That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,<br/>Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host<br/>In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br/>As far as Gods and heavenly Essences<br/>Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br/>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br/>Though all our glory extinct, and happy state<br/>Here swallowed up in endless misery.<br/>But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now<br/>Of force believe almighty, since no less<br/>Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours)<br/>Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,<br/>Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br/>That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br/>Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br/>By right of war, whate'er his business be,<br/>Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,<br/>Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?<br/>What can it the avail though yet we feel<br/>Strength undiminished, or eternal being<br/>To undergo eternal punishment?"<br/>  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:--<br/>"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,<br/>Doing or suffering: but of this be sure--<br/>To do aught good never will be our task,<br/>But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br/>As being the contrary to his high will<br/>Whom we resist. If then his providence<br/>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br/>Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br/>And out of good still to find means of evil;<br/>Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps<br/>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br/>His inmost counsels from their destined aim.<br/>But see! the angry Victor hath recalled<br/>His ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br/>Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,<br/>Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid<br/>The fiery surge that from the precipice<br/>Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,<br/>Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,<br/>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br/>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br/>Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn<br/>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br/>Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,<br/>The seat of desolation, void of light,<br/>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br/>Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend<br/>From off the tossing of these fiery waves;<br/>There rest, if any rest can harbour there;<br/>And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,<br/>Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br/>Our enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/>How overcome this dire calamity,<br/>What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<br/>If not, what resolution from despair."<br/>  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,<br/>With head uplift above the wave, and eyes<br/>That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides<br/>Prone on the flood, extended long and large,<br/>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br/>As whom the fables name of monstrous size,<br/>Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,<br/>Briareos or Typhon, whom the den<br/>By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast<br/>Leviathan, which God of all his works<br/>Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream.<br/>Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,<br/>The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,<br/>Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,<br/>With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,<br/>Moors by his side under the lee, while night<br/>Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.<br/>So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,<br/>Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence<br/>Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will<br/>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br/>Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br/>That with reiterated crimes he might<br/>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br/>Evil to others, and enraged might see<br/>How all his malice served but to bring forth<br/>Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn<br/>On Man by him seduced, but on himself<br/>Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.<br/>  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool<br/>His mighty stature; on each hand the flames<br/>Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and,rolled<br/>In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale.<br/>Then with expanded wings he steers his flight<br/>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,<br/>That felt unusual weight; till on dry land<br/>He lights--if it were land that ever burned<br/>With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,<br/>And such appeared in hue as when the force<br/>Of subterranean wind transprots a hill<br/>Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side<br/>Of thundering Etna, whose combustible<br/>And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,<br/>Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,<br/>And leave a singed bottom all involved<br/>With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole<br/>Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate;<br/>Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood<br/>As gods, and by their own recovered strength,<br/>Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br/>  "Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,"<br/>Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat<br/>That we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom<br/>For that celestial light? Be it so, since he<br/>Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid<br/>What shall be right: farthest from him is best<br/>Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme<br/>Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,<br/>Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,<br/>Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,<br/>Receive thy new possessor--one who brings<br/>A mind not to be changed by place or time.<br/>The mind is its own place, and in itself<br/>Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.<br/>What matter where, if I be still the same,<br/>And what I should be, all but less than he<br/>Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br/>We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br/>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br/>Here we may reigh secure; and, in my choice,<br/>To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:<br/>Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.<br/>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br/>Th' associates and co-partners of our loss,<br/>Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,<br/>And call them not to share with us their part<br/>In this unhappy mansion, or once more<br/>With rallied arms to try what may be yet<br/>Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?"<br/>  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub<br/>Thus answered:--"Leader of those armies bright<br/>Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!<br/>If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge<br/>Of hope in fears and dangers--heard so oft<br/>In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge<br/>Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults<br/>Their surest signal--they will soon resume<br/>New courage and revive, though now they lie<br/>Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,<br/>As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;<br/>No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!"<br/>  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend<br/>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,<br/>Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,<br/>Behind him cast. The broad circumference<br/>Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb<br/>Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views<br/>At evening, from the top of Fesole,<br/>Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,<br/>Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.<br/>His spear--to equal which the tallest pine<br/>Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast<br/>Of some great ammiral, were but a wand--<br/>He walked with, to support uneasy steps<br/>Over the burning marl, not like those steps<br/>On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime<br/>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.<br/>Nathless he so endured, till on the beach<br/>Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called<br/>His legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced<br/>Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks<br/>In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades<br/>High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge<br/>Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed<br/>Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew<br/>Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,<br/>While with perfidious hatred they pursued<br/>The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld<br/>From the safe shore their floating carcases<br/>And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,<br/>Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,<br/>Under amazement of their hideous change.<br/>He called so loud that all the hollow deep<br/>Of Hell resounded:--"Princes, Potentates,<br/>Warriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost,<br/>If such astonishment as this can seize<br/>Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place<br/>After the toil of battle to repose<br/>Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find<br/>To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?<br/>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br/>To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds<br/>Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood<br/>With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon<br/>His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern<br/>Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down<br/>Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts<br/>Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?<br/>Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!"<br/>  They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung<br/>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br/>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br/>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br/>Nor did they not perceive the evil plight<br/>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br/>Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed<br/>Innumerable. As when the potent rod<br/>Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,<br/>Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud<br/>Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,<br/>That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung<br/>Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile;<br/>So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br/>Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,<br/>'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires;<br/>Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear<br/>Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br/>Their course, in even balance down they light<br/>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain:<br/>A multitude like which the populous North<br/>Poured never from her frozen loins to pass<br/>Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons<br/>Came like a deluge on the South, and spread<br/>Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.<br/>Forthwith, form every squadron and each band,<br/>The heads and leaders thither haste where stood<br/>Their great Commander--godlike Shapes, and Forms<br/>Excelling human; princely Dignities;<br/>And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,<br/>Though on their names in Heavenly records now<br/>Be no memorial, blotted out and rased<br/>By their rebellion from the Books of Life.<br/>Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve<br/>Got them new names, till, wandering o'er the earth,<br/>Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man,<br/>By falsities and lies the greatest part<br/>Of mankind they corrupted to forsake<br/>God their Creator, and th' invisible<br/>Glory of him that made them to transform<br/>Oft to the image of a brute, adorned<br/>With gay religions full of pomp and gold,<br/>And devils to adore for deities:<br/>Then were they known to men by various names,<br/>And various idols through the heathen world.<br/>  Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,<br/>Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch,<br/>At their great Emperor's call, as next in worth<br/>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br/>While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?<br/>  The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell<br/>Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix<br/>Their seats, long after, next the seat of God,<br/>Their altars by his altar, gods adored<br/>Among the nations round, and durst abide<br/>Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned<br/>Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed<br/>Within his sanctuary itself their shrines,<br/>Abominations; and with cursed things<br/>His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned,<br/>And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br/>First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood<br/>Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears;<br/>Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,<br/>Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire<br/>To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite<br/>Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,<br/>In Argob and in Basan, to the stream<br/>Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such<br/>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br/>Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build<br/>His temple right against the temple of God<br/>On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove<br/>The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence<br/>And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.<br/>Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons,<br/>From Aroar to Nebo and the wild<br/>Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon<br/>And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond<br/>The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,<br/>And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool:<br/>Peor his other name, when he enticed<br/>Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,<br/>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br/>Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged<br/>Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove<br/>Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,<br/>Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.<br/>With these came they who, from the bordering flood<br/>Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts<br/>Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names<br/>Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those male,<br/>These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,<br/>Can either sex assume, or both; so soft<br/>And uncompounded is their essence pure,<br/>Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,<br/>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br/>Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,<br/>Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,<br/>Can execute their airy purposes,<br/>And works of love or enmity fulfil.<br/>For those the race of Israel oft forsook<br/>Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left<br/>His righteous altar, bowing lowly down<br/>To bestial gods; for which their heads as low<br/>Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear<br/>Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br/>Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called<br/>Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;<br/>To whose bright image nigntly by the moon<br/>Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;<br/>In Sion also not unsung, where stood<br/>Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built<br/>By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,<br/>Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell<br/>To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,<br/>Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br/>The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br/>In amorous ditties all a summer's day,<br/>While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br/>Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br/>Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br/>Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,<br/>Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch<br/>Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br/>His eye surveyed the dark idolatries<br/>Of alienated Judah. Next came one<br/>Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark<br/>Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,<br/>In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,<br/>Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:<br/>Dagon his name, sea-monster,upward man<br/>And downward fish; yet had his temple high<br/>Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast<br/>Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,<br/>And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.<br/>Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat<br/>Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks<br/>Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.<br/>He also against the house of God was bold:<br/>A leper once he lost, and gained a king--<br/>Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew<br/>God's altar to disparage and displace<br/>For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn<br/>His odious offerings, and adore the gods<br/>Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared<br/>A crew who, under names of old renown--<br/>Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train--<br/>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused<br/>Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek<br/>Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms<br/>Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape<br/>Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed<br/>The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king<br/>Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,<br/>Likening his Maker to the grazed ox--<br/>Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed<br/>From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke<br/>Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.<br/>Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd<br/>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br/>Vice for itself. To him no temple stood<br/>Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he<br/>In temples and at altars, when the priest<br/>Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled<br/>With lust and violence the house of God?<br/>In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br/>And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br/>Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,<br/>And injury and outrage; and, when night<br/>Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<br/>Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<br/>Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night<br/>In Gibeah, when the hospitable door<br/>Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.<br/>  These were the prime in order and in might:<br/>The rest were long to tell; though far renowned<br/>Th' Ionian gods--of Javan's issue held<br/>Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,<br/>Their boasted parents;--Titan, Heaven's first-born,<br/>With his enormous brood, and birthright seized<br/>By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,<br/>His own and Rhea's son, like measure found;<br/>So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete<br/>And Ida known, thence on the snowy top<br/>Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,<br/>Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,<br/>Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds<br/>Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old<br/>Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields,<br/>And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.<br/>  All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br/>Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared<br/>Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief<br/>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br/>In loss itself; which on his countenance cast<br/>Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride<br/>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br/>Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised<br/>Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.<br/>Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound<br/>Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared<br/>His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed<br/>Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:<br/>Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled<br/>Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,<br/>Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,<br/>With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,<br/>Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while<br/>Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:<br/>At which the universal host up-sent<br/>A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond<br/>Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.<br/>All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br/>Ten thousand banners rise into the air,<br/>With orient colours waving: with them rose<br/>A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms<br/>Appeared, and serried shields in thick array<br/>Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move<br/>In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood<br/>Of flutes and soft recorders--such as raised<br/>To height of noblest temper heroes old<br/>Arming to battle, and instead of rage<br/>Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved<br/>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;<br/>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br/>With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase<br/>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br/>From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,<br/>Breathing united force with fixed thought,<br/>Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed<br/>Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now<br/>Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front<br/>Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise<br/>Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,<br/>Awaiting what command their mighty Chief<br/>Had to impose. He through the armed files<br/>Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse<br/>The whole battalion views--their order due,<br/>Their visages and stature as of gods;<br/>Their number last he sums. And now his heart<br/>Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,<br/>Glories: for never, since created Man,<br/>Met such embodied force as, named with these,<br/>Could merit more than that small infantry<br/>Warred on by cranes--though all the giant brood<br/>Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined<br/>That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side<br/>Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds<br/>In fable or romance of Uther's son,<br/>Begirt with British and Armoric knights;<br/>And all who since, baptized or infidel,<br/>Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,<br/>Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,<br/>Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore<br/>When Charlemain with all his peerage fell<br/>By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond<br/>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed<br/>Their dread Commander. He, above the rest<br/>In shape and gesture proudly eminent,<br/>Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost<br/>All her original brightness, nor appeared<br/>Less than Archangel ruined, and th' excess<br/>Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen<br/>Looks through the horizontal misty air<br/>Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,<br/>In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds<br/>On half the nations, and with fear of change<br/>Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone<br/>Above them all th' Archangel: but his face<br/>Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care<br/>Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows<br/>Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride<br/>Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast<br/>Signs of remorse and passion, to behold<br/>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br/>(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned<br/>For ever now to have their lot in pain--<br/>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced<br/>Of Heaven, and from eteranl splendours flung<br/>For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood,<br/>Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire<br/>Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines,<br/>With singed top their stately growth, though bare,<br/>Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared<br/>To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend<br/>From wing to wing, and half enclose him round<br/>With all his peers: attention held them mute.<br/>Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,<br/>Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br/>Words interwove with sighs found out their way:--<br/>  "O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers<br/>Matchless, but with th' Almighth!--and that strife<br/>Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,<br/>As this place testifies, and this dire change,<br/>Hateful to utter. But what power of mind,<br/>Forseeing or presaging, from the depth<br/>Of knowledge past or present, could have feared<br/>How such united force of gods, how such<br/>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br/>For who can yet believe, though after loss,<br/>That all these puissant legions, whose exile<br/>Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend,<br/>Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?<br/>For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,<br/>If counsels different, or danger shunned<br/>By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br/>Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure<br/>Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,<br/>Consent or custom, and his regal state<br/>Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed--<br/>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br/>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,<br/>So as not either to provoke, or dread<br/>New war provoked: our better part remains<br/>To work in close design, by fraud or guile,<br/>What force effected not; that he no less<br/>At length from us may find, who overcomes<br/>By force hath overcome but half his foe.<br/>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br/>There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long<br/>Intended to create, and therein plant<br/>A generation whom his choice regard<br/>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.<br/>Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps<br/>Our first eruption--thither, or elsewhere;<br/>For this infernal pit shall never hold<br/>Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyss<br/>Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br/>Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired;<br/>For who can think submission? War, then, war<br/>Open or understood, must be resolved."<br/>  He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew<br/>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br/>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br/>Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged<br/>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms<br/>Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,<br/>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.<br/>  There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top<br/>Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire<br/>Shone with a glossy scurf--undoubted sign<br/>That in his womb was hid metallic ore,<br/>The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed,<br/>A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands<br/>Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed,<br/>Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,<br/>Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on--<br/>Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell<br/>From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts<br/>Were always downward bent, admiring more<br/>The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold,<br/>Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed<br/>In vision beatific. By him first<br/>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br/>Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands<br/>Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth<br/>For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br/>Opened into the hill a spacious wound,<br/>And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire<br/>That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best<br/>Deserve the precious bane. And here let those<br/>Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell<br/>Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings,<br/>Learn how their greatest monuments of fame<br/>And strength, and art, are easily outdone<br/>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br/>What in an age they, with incessant toil<br/>And hands innumerable, scarce perform.<br/>Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,<br/>That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br/>Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude<br/>With wondrous art founded the massy ore,<br/>Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.<br/>A third as soon had formed within the ground<br/>A various mould, and from the boiling cells<br/>By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;<br/>As in an organ, from one blast of wind,<br/>To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.<br/>Anon out of the earth a fabric huge<br/>Rose like an exhalation, with the sound<br/>Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet--<br/>Built like a temple, where pilasters round<br/>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br/>With golden architrave; nor did there want<br/>Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;<br/>The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon<br/>Nor great Alcairo such magnificence<br/>Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine<br/>Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat<br/>Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove<br/>In wealth and luxury. Th' ascending pile<br/>Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors,<br/>Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide<br/>Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth<br/>And level pavement: from the arched roof,<br/>Pendent by subtle magic, many a row<br/>Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed<br/>With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light<br/>As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br/>Admiring entered; and the work some praise,<br/>And some the architect. His hand was known<br/>In Heaven by many a towered structure high,<br/>Where sceptred Angels held their residence,<br/>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br/>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br/>Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.<br/>Nor was his name unheard or unadored<br/>In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land<br/>Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell<br/>From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove<br/>Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn<br/>To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,<br/>A summer's day, and with the setting sun<br/>Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,<br/>On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,<br/>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br/>Fell long before; nor aught aviled him now<br/>To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape<br/>By all his engines, but was headlong sent,<br/>With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.<br/>  Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command<br/>Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony<br/>And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim<br/>A solemn council forthwith to be held<br/>At Pandemonium, the high capital<br/>Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called<br/>From every band and squared regiment<br/>By place or choice the worthiest: they anon<br/>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br/>Attended. All access was thronged; the gates<br/>And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall<br/>(Though like a covered field, where champions bold<br/>Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair<br/>Defied the best of Paynim chivalry<br/>To mortal combat, or career with lance),<br/>Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,<br/>Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees<br/>In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.<br/>Pour forth their populous youth about the hive<br/>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br/>Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,<br/>The suburb of their straw-built citadel,<br/>New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer<br/>Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd<br/>Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,<br/>Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed<br/>In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons,<br/>Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room<br/>Throng numberless--like that pygmean race<br/>Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,<br/>Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side<br/>Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,<br/>Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon<br/>Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth<br/>Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance<br/>Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;<br/>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br/>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br/>Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,<br/>Though without number still, amidst the hall<br/>Of that infernal court. But far within,<br/>And in their own dimensions like themselves,<br/>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br/>In close recess and secret conclave sat,<br/>A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,<br/>Frequent and full. After short silence then,<br/>And summons read, the great consult began.
