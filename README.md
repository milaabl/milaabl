# üíÆ The Two Foscari by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    ACT I.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Ducal Palace_.<br/><br/>           _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO, _meeting_.<br/><br/>_Lor._ WHERE is the prisoner?<br/><br/>_Bar._                        Reposing from<br/>The Question.<br/><br/>_Lor._        The hour's past--fixed yesterday<br/>For the resumption of his trial.--Let us<br/>Rejoin our colleagues in the council, and<br/>Urge his recall.<br/><br/>_Bar._          Nay, let him profit by<br/>A few brief minutes for his tortured limbs;<br/>He was o'erwrought by the Question yesterday,<br/>And may die under it if now repeated.<br/><br/>_Lor._ Well?<br/><br/>_Bar._      I yield not to you in love of justice,<br/>Or hate of the ambitious Foscari,<br/>Father and son, and all their noxious race;<br/>But the poor wretch has suffered beyond Nature's<br/>Most stoical endurance.<br/><br/>_Lor._                 Without owning<br/>His crime?<br/><br/>_Bar._    Perhaps without committing any.<br/>But he avowed the letter to the Duke<br/>Of Milan, and his sufferings half atone for<br/>Such weakness.<br/><br/>_Lor._        We shall see.<br/><br/>_Bar._                     You, Loredano,<br/>Pursue hereditary hate too far.<br/><br/>_Lor._ How far?<br/><br/>_Bar._         To extermination.<br/><br/>_Lor._                           When they are<br/>Extinct, you may say this.--Let's in to council.<br/><br/>_Bar._ Yet pause--the number of our colleagues is not<br/>Complete yet; two are wanting ere we can<br/>Proceed.<br/><br/>_Lor._   And the chief judge, the Doge?<br/><br/>_Bar._                                 No--he,<br/>With more than Roman fortitude, is ever<br/>First at the board in this unhappy process<br/>Against his last and only son.<br/><br/>_Lor._                         True--true--<br/>His _last_.<br/><br/>_Bar._   Will nothing move you?<br/><br/>_Lor._                        _Feels he_, think you?<br/><br/>_Bar._ He shows it not.<br/><br/>_Lor._                 I have marked _that_--the wretch!<br/><br/>_Bar._ But yesterday, I hear, on his return<br/>To the ducal chambers, as he passed the threshold<br/>The old man fainted.<br/><br/>_Lor._             It begins to work, then.<br/><br/>_Bar._ The work is half your own.<br/><br/>_Lor._                           And should be _all_ mine--<br/>My father and my uncle are no more.<br/><br/>_Bar._ I have read their epitaph, which says they died<br/>By poison.<br/><br/>_Lor._      When the Doge declared that he<br/>Should never deem himself a sovereign till<br/>The death of Peter Loredano, both<br/>The brothers sickened shortly:--he _is_ Sovereign.<br/><br/>_Bar._ A wretched one.<br/><br/>_Lor._                What should they be who make<br/>Orphans?<br/><br/>_Bar._ But _did_ the Doge make you so?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                Yes.<br/><br/>_Bar._ What solid proofs?<br/><br/>_Lor._                   When Princes set themselves<br/>To work in secret, proofs and process are<br/>Alike made difficult; but I have such<br/>Of the first, as shall make the second needless.<br/><br/>_Bar._ But you will move by law?<br/><br/>_Lor._                          By all the laws<br/>Which he would leave us.<br/><br/>_Bar._                  They are such in this<br/>Our state as render retribution easier<br/>Than 'mongst remoter nations. Is it true<br/>That you have written in your books of commerce,<br/>(The wealthy practice of our highest nobles)<br/>"Doge Foscari, my debtor for the deaths<br/>Of Marco and Pietro Loredano,<br/>My sire and uncle?"<br/><br/>_Lor._             It is written thus.<br/><br/>_Bar._ And will you leave it unerased?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                  Till balanced.<br/><br/>_Bar._ And how?<br/><br/>                 [_Two Senators pass over the stage, as in their way<br/>                     to "the Hall of the Council of Ten."_<br/><br/>_Lor._          You see the number is complete.<br/>Follow me.                                           [_Exit_ LOREDANO.<br/><br/>_Bar._ (_solus_). Follow _thee_! I have followed long<br/>Thy path of desolation, as the wave<br/>Sweeps after that before it, alike whelming<br/>The wreck that creaks to the wild winds, and wretch<br/>Who shrieks within its riven ribs, as gush<br/>The waters through them; but this son and sire<br/>Might move the elements to pause, and yet<br/>Must I on hardily like them--Oh! would<br/>I could as blindly and remorselessly!--<br/>Lo, where he comes!--Be still, my heart! they are<br/>Thy foes, must be thy victims: wilt thou beat<br/>For those who almost broke thee?<br/><br/>      _Enter Guards, with young_ FOSCARI _as Prisoner, etc._<br/><br/>_Guard_.                         Let him rest.<br/>Signor, take time.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._        I thank thee, friend, I'm feeble;<br/>But thou mayst stand reproved.<br/><br/>_Guard_.                      I'll stand the hazard.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ That's kind:--I meet some pity, but no mercy;<br/>This is the first.<br/><br/>_Guard_.          And might be the last, did they<br/>Who rule behold us.<br/><br/>_Bar._ (_advancing to the Guard_). There is one who does:<br/>Yet fear not; I will neither be thy judge<br/>Nor thy accuser; though the hour is past,<br/>Wait their last summons--I am of "the Ten,"<br/>And waiting for that summons, sanction you<br/>Even by my presence: when the last call sounds,<br/>We'll in together.--Look well to the prisoner!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ What voice is that?--'Tis Barbarigo's! Ah!<br/>Our House's foe, and one of my few judges.<br/><br/>_Bar._ To balance such a foe, if such there be,<br/>Thy father sits amongst thy judges.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                         True,<br/>He judges.<br/><br/>_Bar._      Then deem not the laws too harsh<br/>Which yield so much indulgence to a sire,<br/>As to allow his voice in such high matter<br/>As the state's safety--<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._           And his son's. I'm faint;<br/>Let me approach, I pray you, for a breath<br/>Of air, yon window which o'erlooks the waters.<br/><br/>_Enter an Officer, who whispers_ BARBARIGO.<br/><br/>_Bar._ (to the Guard). Let him approach. I must not speak with him<br/>Further than thus: I have transgressed my duty<br/>In this brief parley, and must now redeem it<br/>Within the Council Chamber.                         [_Exit_ BARBARIGO.<br/><br/>                   [_Guard conducting_ JACOPO FOSCARI _to the window_.<br/><br/>_Guard_.                  There, sir, 'tis<br/>Open.--How feel you?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._         Like a boy--Oh Venice!<br/><br/>_Guard_. And your limbs?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._            Limbs! how often have they borne me<br/>Bounding o'er yon blue tide, as I have skimmed<br/>The gondola along in childish race,<br/>And, masqued as a young gondolier, amidst<br/>My gay competitors, noble as I,<br/>Raced for our pleasure, in the pride of strength;<br/>While the fair populace of crowding beauties,<br/>Plebeian as patrician, cheered us on<br/>With dazzling smiles, and wishes audible,<br/>And waving kerchiefs, and applauding hands,<br/>Even to the goal!--How many a time have I<br/>Cloven with arm still lustier, breast more daring,<br/>The wave all roughened; with a swimmer's stroke<br/>Flinging the billows back from my drenched hair,<br/>And laughing from my lip the audacious brine,<br/>Which kissed it like a wine-cup, rising o'er<br/>The waves as they arose, and prouder still<br/>The loftier they uplifted me; and oft,<br/>In wantonness of spirit, plunging down<br/>Into their green and glassy gulfs, and making<br/>My way to shells and sea-weed, all unseen<br/>By those above, till they waxed fearful; then<br/>Returning with my grasp full of such tokens<br/>As showed that I had searched the deep: exulting,<br/>With a far-dashing stroke, and, drawing deep<br/>The long-suspended breath, again I spurned<br/>The foam which broke around me, and pursued<br/>My track like a sea-bird.--I was a boy then.<br/><br/>_Guard_. Be a man now: there never was more need<br/>Of manhood's strength.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ (_looking from the lattice_). My beautiful, my own,<br/>My only Venice--_this is breath_! Thy breeze,<br/>Thine Adrian sea-breeze, how it fans my face!<br/>Thy very winds feel native to my veins,<br/>And cool them into calmness! How unlike<br/>The hot gales of the horrid Cyclades,<br/>Which howled about my Candiote dungeon, and<br/>Made my heart sick.<br/><br/>_Guard_.           I see the colour comes<br/>Back to your cheek: Heaven send you strength to bear<br/>What more may be imposed!--I dread to think on't.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ They will not banish me again?--No--no,<br/>Let them wring on; I am strong yet.<br/><br/>_Guard_.                           Confess,<br/>And the rack will be spared you.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                     I confessed<br/>Once--twice before: both times they exiled me.<br/><br/>_Guard_. And the third time will slay you.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                              Let them do so,<br/>So I be buried in my birth-place: better<br/>Be ashes here than aught that lives elsewhere.<br/><br/>_Guard_. And can you so much love the soil which hates you?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ The soil!--Oh no, it is the seed of the soil<br/>Which persecutes me: but my native earth<br/>Will take me as a mother to her arms.<br/>I ask no more than a Venetian grave,<br/>A dungeon, what they will, so it be here.<br/><br/>                       _Enter an Officer_.<br/><br/>_Offi._ Bring in the prisoner!<br/><br/>_Guard_.                       Signor, you hear the order.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Aye, I am used to such a summons; 'tis<br/>The third time they have tortured me:--then lend me<br/>Thine arm.                                            [_To the Guard_.<br/><br/>_Offi._   Take mine, sir; 'tis my duty to<br/>Be nearest to your person.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._               You!--you are he<br/>Who yesterday presided o'er my pangs--<br/>Away!--I'll walk alone.<br/><br/>_Offi._                As you please, Signor;<br/>The sentence was not of my signing, but<br/>I dared not disobey the Council when<br/>They----<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Bade thee stretch me on their horrid engine.<br/>I pray thee touch me not--that is, just now;<br/>The time will come they will renew that order,<br/>But keep off from me till 'tis issued. As<br/>I look upon thy hands my curdling limbs<br/>Quiver with the anticipated wrenching,<br/>And the cold drops strain through my brow, as if----<br/>But onward--I have borne it--I can bear it.--<br/>How looks my father?<br/><br/>_Offi._             With his wonted aspect.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ So does the earth, and sky, the blue of Ocean,<br/>The brightness of our city, and her domes,<br/>The mirth of her Piazza--even now<br/>Its merry hum of nations pierces here,<br/>Even here, into these chambers of the unknown<br/>Who govern, and the unknown and the unnumbered<br/>Judged and destroyed in silence,--all things wear<br/>The self-same aspect, to my very sire!<br/>Nothing can sympathise with Foscari,<br/>Not even a Foscari.--Sir, I attend you.<br/>                             [_Exeunt_ JACOPO FOSCARI, _Officer, etc._<br/><br/>               _Enter_ MEMMO _and another Senator_.<br/><br/>_Mem._ He's gone--we are too late:--think you "the Ten"<br/>Will sit for any length of time to-day?<br/><br/>_Sen._ They say the prisoner is most obdurate,<br/>Persisting in his first avowal; but<br/>More I know not.<br/><br/>_Mem._          And that is much; the secrets<br/>Of yon terrific chamber are as hidden<br/>From us, the premier nobles of the state,<br/>As from the people.<br/><br/>_Sen._             Save the wonted rumours,<br/>Which--like the tales of spectres, that are rife<br/>Near ruined buildings--never have been proved,<br/>Nor wholly disbelieved: men know as little<br/>Of the state's real acts as of the grave's<br/>Unfathomed mysteries.<br/><br/>_Mem._               But with length of time<br/>We gain a step in knowledge, and I look<br/>Forward to be one day of the decemvirs.<br/><br/>_Sen._ Or Doge?<br/><br/>_Mem._         Why, no; not if I can avoid it.<br/><br/>_Sen._ 'Tis the first station of the state, and may<br/>Be lawfully desired, and lawfully<br/>Attained by noble aspirants.<br/><br/>_Mem._                      To such<br/>I leave it; though born noble, my ambition<br/>Is limited: I'd rather be an unit<br/>Of an united and Imperial "Ten,"<br/>Than shine a lonely, though a gilded cipher.--<br/>Whom have we here? the wife of Foscari?<br/><br/>            _Enter_ MARINA, _with a female Attendant_.<br/><br/>_Mar._ What, no one?--I am wrong, there still are two;<br/>But they are senators.<br/><br/>_Mem._                Most noble lady,<br/>Command us.<br/><br/>_Mar._      _I command_!--Alas! my life<br/>Has been one long entreaty, and a vain one.<br/><br/>_Mem._ I understand thee, but I must not answer.<br/><br/>_Mar._ (_fiercely_). True--none dare answer here save on the rack,<br/>Or question save those----<br/><br/>_Mem._ (_interrupting her_). High-born dame! bethink thee<br/>Where thou now art.<br/><br/>_Mar._             Where I now am!--It was<br/>My husband's father's palace.<br/><br/>_Mem._                       The Duke's palace.<br/><br/>_Mar._ And his son's prison!--True, I have not forgot it;<br/>And, if there were no other nearer, bitterer<br/>Remembrances, would thank the illustrious Memmo<br/>For pointing out the pleasures of the place.<br/><br/>_Mem._ Be calm!<br/><br/>_Mar._ (_looking up towards heaven_). I am; but oh, thou eternal God!<br/>Canst _thou_ continue so, with such a world?<br/><br/>_Mem._ Thy husband yet may be absolved.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                  He is,<br/>In Heaven. I pray you, Signer Senator,<br/>Speak not of that; you are a man of office,<br/>So is the Doge; he has a son at stake<br/>Now, at this moment, and I have a husband,<br/>Or had; they are there within, or were at least<br/>An hour since, face to face, as judge and culprit:<br/>Will _he_ condemn _him_?<br/><br/>_Mem._                         I trust not.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                     But if<br/>He does not, there are those will sentence both.<br/><br/>_Mem._ They can.<br/><br/>_Mar._           And with them power and will are one<br/>In wickedness;--my husband's lost!<br/><br/>_Mem._                            Not so;<br/>Justice is judge in Venice.<br/><br/>_Mar._                     If it were so,<br/>There now would be no Venice. But let it<br/>Live on, so the good die not, till the hour<br/>Of Nature's summons; but "the Ten's" is quicker,<br/>And we must wait on't. Ah! a voice of wail!<br/>                                                [_A faint cry within_.<br/><br/>_Sen._ Hark!<br/><br/>_Mem._      'Twas a cry of--<br/><br/>_Mar._                       No, no; not my husband's--<br/>Not Foscari's.<br/><br/>_Mem._      The voice was--<br/><br/>_Mar._                    _Not his_: no.<br/>He shriek! No; that should be his father's part,<br/>Not his--not his--he'll die in silence.<br/>                                        [_A faint groan again within_.<br/><br/>_Mem._                                  What!<br/>Again?<br/><br/>_Mar._ _His_ voice! it seemed so: I will not<br/>Believe it. Should he shrink, I cannot cease<br/>To love; but--no--no--no--it must have been<br/>A fearful pang, which wrung a groan from him.<br/><br/>_Sen._ And, feeling for thy husband's wrongs, wouldst thou<br/>Have him bear more than mortal pain in silence?<br/><br/>_Mar._ We all must bear our tortures. I have not<br/>Left barren the great house of Foscari,<br/>Though they sweep both the Doge and son from life;<br/>I have endured as much in giving life<br/>To those who will succeed them, as they can<br/>In leaving it: but mine were joyful pangs:<br/>And yet they wrung me till I _could_ have shrieked,<br/>But did not; for my hope was to bring forth<br/>Heroes, and would not welcome them with tears.<br/><br/>_Mem._ All's silent now.<br/><br/>_Mar._                  Perhaps all's over; but<br/>I will not deem it: he hath nerved himself,<br/>And now defies them.<br/><br/>                   _Enter an Officer hastily_.<br/><br/>_Mem._            How now, friend, what seek you?<br/><br/>_Offi._ A leech. The prisoner has fainted.            [_Exit Officer_.<br/><br/>_Mem._                                     Lady,<br/>'Twere better to retire.<br/><br/>_Sen._ (_offering to assist her_), I pray thee do so.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Off! _I_ will tend him.<br/><br/>_Mem._                        You!

Is that so strange,<br/>That you repeat the word emphatically?<br/><br/>_Lor._ So far from strange, that never was there death<br/>In my mind half so natural as theirs.<br/>Think _you_ not so?<br/><br/>_Doge_.              What should I think of mortals?<br/><br/>_Lor._ That they have mortal foes.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           I understand you;<br/>Your sires were mine, and you are heir in all things.<br/><br/>_Lor._ You best know if I should be so.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                  I do.<br/>Your fathers were my foes, and I have heard<br/>Foul rumours were abroad; I have also read<br/>Their epitaph, attributing their deaths<br/>To poison. 'Tis perhaps as true as most<br/>Inscriptions upon tombs, and yet no less<br/>A fable.<br/><br/>_Lor._   Who dares say so?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   I!----'Tis true<br/>Your fathers were mine enemies, as bitter<br/>As their son e'er can be, and I no less<br/>Was theirs; but I was _openly_ their foe:<br/>I never worked by plot in Council, nor<br/>Cabal in commonwealth, nor secret means<br/>Of practice against life by steel or drug.<br/>The proof is--your existence.<br/><br/>_Lor._                       I fear not.<br/><br/>_Doge_. You have no cause, being what I am; but were I<br/>That you would have me thought, you long ere now<br/>Were past the sense of fear. Hate on; I care not.<br/><br/>_Lor._ I never yet knew that a noble's life<br/>In Venice had to dread a Doge's frown,<br/>That is, by open means.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                But I, good Signor,<br/>Am, or at least _was_, more than a mere duke,<br/>In blood, in mind, in means; and that they know<br/>Who dreaded to elect me, and have since<br/>Striven all they dare to weigh me down: be sure,<br/>Before or since that period, had I held you<br/>At so much price as to require your absence,<br/>A word of mine had set such spirits to work<br/>As would have made you nothing. But in all things<br/>I have observed the strictest reverence;<br/>Not for the laws alone, for those _you_ have strained<br/>(I do not speak of _you_ but as a single<br/>Voice of the many) somewhat beyond what<br/>I could enforce for my authority,<br/>Were I disposed to brawl; but, as I said,<br/>I have observed with veneration, like<br/>A priest's for the High Altar, even unto<br/>The sacrifice of my own blood and quiet,<br/>Safety, and all save honour, the decrees,<br/>The health, the pride, and welfare of the State.<br/>And now, sir, to your business.<br/><br/>_Lor._                        'Tis decreed,<br/>That, without further repetition of<br/>The Question, or continuance of the trial,<br/>Which only tends to show how stubborn guilt is,<br/>("The Ten," dispensing with the stricter law<br/>Which still prescribes the Question till a full<br/>Confession, and the prisoner partly having<br/>Avowed his crime in not denying that<br/>The letter to the Duke of Milan's his),<br/>James Foscari return to banishment,<br/>And sail in the same galley which conveyed him.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Thank God! At least they will not drag him more<br/>Before that horrible tribunal. Would he<br/>But think so, to my mind the happiest doom,<br/>Not he alone, but all who dwell here, could<br/>Desire, were to escape from such a land.<br/><br/>_Doge_. That is not a Venetian thought, my daughter.<br/><br/>_Mar._ No, 'twas too human. May I share his exile?<br/><br/>_Lor._ Of this "the Ten" said nothing.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                 So I thought!<br/>That were too human, also. But it was not<br/>Inhibited?<br/><br/>_Lor._    It was not named.<br/><br/>_Mar. (to the Doge_).      Then, father,<br/>Surely you can obtain or grant me thus much:<br/>                                                       [_To_ LOREDANO.<br/>And you, sir, not oppose my prayer to be<br/>Permitted to accompany my husband.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I will endeavour.<br/><br/>_Mar._                   And you, Signor?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                   Lady!<br/>'Tis not for me to anticipate the pleasure<br/>Of the tribunal.<br/><br/>_Mar._          Pleasure! what a word<br/>To use for the decrees of----<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   Daughter, know you<br/>In what a presence you pronounce these things?<br/><br/>_Mar._ A Prince's and his subject's.<br/><br/>_Lor._                               Subject!<br/><br/>_Mar._                                       Oh!<br/>It galls you:--well, you are his equal, as<br/>You think; but that you are not, nor would be,<br/>Were he a peasant:--well, then, you're a Prince,<br/>A princely noble; and what then am I?<br/><br/>_Lor._ The offspring of a noble house.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                And wedded<br/>To one as noble. What, or whose, then, is<br/>The presence that should silence my free thoughts?<br/><br/>_Lor._ The presence of your husband's Judges.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                       And<br/>The deference due even to the lightest word<br/>That falls from those who rule in Venice.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                    Keep<br/>Those maxims for your mass of scared mechanics,<br/>Your merchants, your Dalmatian and Greek slaves,<br/>Your tributaries, your dumb citizens,<br/>And masked nobility, your sbirri, and<br/>Your spies, your galley and your other slaves,<br/>To whom your midnight carryings off and drownings,<br/>Your dungeons next the palace roofs, or under<br/>The water's level; your mysterious meetings,<br/>And unknown dooms, and sudden executions,<br/>Your "Bridge of Sighs," your strangling chamber, and<br/>Your torturing instruments, have made ye seem<br/>The beings of another and worse world!<br/>Keep such for them: I fear ye not. I know ye;<br/>Have known and proved your worst, in the infernal<br/>Process of my poor husband! Treat me as<br/>Ye treated him:--you did so, in so dealing<br/>With him. Then what have I to fear _from_ you,<br/>Even if I were of fearful nature, which<br/>I trust I am not?<br/><br/>_Doge_.          You hear, she speaks wildly.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Not wisely, yet not wildly.<br/><br/>_Lor._                             Lady! words<br/>Uttered within these walls I bear no further<br/>Than to the threshold, saving such as pass<br/>Between the Duke and me on the State's service.<br/>Doge! have you aught in answer?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                        Something from<br/>The Doge; it may be also from a parent.<br/><br/>_Lor._ My mission _here_ is to the _Doge_.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                   Then say<br/>The Doge will choose his own ambassador,<br/>Or state in person what is meet; and for<br/>The father----<br/><br/>_Lor._        I remember _mine_.--Farewell!<br/>I kiss the hands of the illustrious Lady,<br/>And bow me to the Duke.                              [_Exit_ LOREDANO.<br/><br/>_Mar._                 Are you content?<br/><br/>_Doge_. I am what you behold.<br/><br/>_Mar._                       And that's a mystery.<br/><br/>_Doge_. All things are so to mortals; who can read them<br/>Save he who made? or, if they can, the few<br/>And gifted spirits, who have studied long<br/>That loathsome volume--man, and pored upon<br/>Those black and bloody leaves, his heart and brain,<br/>But learn a magic which recoils upon<br/>The adept who pursues it: all the sins<br/>We find in others, Nature made our own;<br/>All our advantages are those of Fortune;<br/>Birth, wealth, health, beauty, are her accidents,<br/>And when we cry out against Fate, 'twere well<br/>We should remember Fortune can take nought<br/>Save what she _gave_--the rest was nakedness,<br/>And lusts, and appetites, and vanities,<br/>The universal heritage, to battle<br/>With as we may, and least in humblest stations,<br/>Where Hunger swallows all in one low want,<br/>And the original ordinance, that man<br/>Must sweat for his poor pittance, keeps all passions<br/>Aloof, save fear of famine! All is low,<br/>And false, and hollow--clay from first to last,<br/>The Prince's urn no less than potter's vessel.<br/>Our Fame is in men's breath, our lives upon<br/>Less than their breath; our durance upon days<br/>Our days on seasons; our whole being on<br/>Something which is not _us_!--So, we are slaves,<br/>The greatest as the meanest--nothing rests<br/>Upon our will; the will itself no less<br/>Depends upon a straw than on a storm;<br/>And when we think we lead, we are most led,<br/>And still towards Death, a thing which comes as much<br/>Without our act or choice as birth, so that<br/>Methinks we must have sinned in some old world,<br/>And _this_ is Hell: the best is, that it is not<br/>Eternal.<br/><br/>_Mar._ These are things we cannot judge<br/>On earth.<br/><br/>_Doge_. And how then shall we judge each other,<br/>Who are all earth, and I, who am called upon<br/>To judge my son? I have administered<br/>My country faithfully--victoriously--<br/>I dare them to the proof, the _chart_ of what<br/>She was and is: my reign has doubled realms;<br/>And, in reward, the gratitude of Venice<br/>Has left, or is about to leave, _me_ single.<br/><br/>_Mar._ And Foscari? I do not think of such things,<br/>So I be left with him.<br/><br/>_Doge_.               You shall be so;<br/>Thus much they cannot well deny.<br/><br/>_Mar._                          And if<br/>They should, I will fly with him.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                         That can ne'er be.<br/>And whither would you fly?<br/><br/>_Mar._                    I know not, reck not--<br/>To Syria, Egypt, to the Ottoman--<br/>Any where, where we might respire unfettered,<br/>And live nor girt by spies, nor liable<br/>To edicts of inquisitors of state.<br/><br/>_Doge_. What, wouldst thou have a renegade for husband,<br/>And turn him into traitor?<br/><br/>_Mar._                    He is none!<br/>The Country is the traitress, which thrusts forth<br/>Her best and bravest from her. Tyranny<br/>Is far the worst of treasons. Dost thou deem<br/>None rebels except subjects? The Prince who<br/>Neglects or violates his trust is more<br/>A brigand than the robber-chief.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                          I cannot<br/>Charge me with such a breach of faith.<br/><br/>_Mar_                                 No; thou<br/>Observ'st, obey'st such laws as make old Draco's<br/>A code of mercy by comparison.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I found the law; I did not make it. Were I<br/>A subject, still I might find parts and portions<br/>Fit for amendment; but as Prince, I never<br/>Would change, for the sake of my house, the charter<br/>Left by our fathers.<br/><br/>_Mar._              Did they make it for<br/>The ruin of their children?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                    Under such laws, Venice<br/>Has risen to what she is--a state to rival<br/>In deeds, and days, and sway, and, let me add,<br/>In glory (for we have had Roman spirits<br/>Amongst us), all that history has bequeathed<br/>Of Rome and Carthage in their best times, when<br/>The people swayed by Senates.<br/><br/>_Mar._                       Rather say,<br/>Groaned under the stern Oligarchs.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           Perhaps so;<br/>But yet subdued the World: in such a state<br/>An individual, be he richest of<br/>Such rank as is permitted, or the meanest,<br/>Without a name, is alike nothing, when<br/>The policy, irrevocably tending<br/>To one great end, must be maintained in vigour.<br/><br/>_Mar._ This means that you are more a Doge than father.<br/><br/>_Doge_. It means, I am more citizen than either.<br/>If we had not for many centuries<br/>Had thousands of such citizens, and shall,<br/>I trust, have still such, Venice were no city.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Accurs√©d be the city where the laws<br/>Would stifle Nature's!<br/><br/>_Doge_.               Had I as many sons<br/>As I have years, I would have given them all,<br/>Not without feeling, but I would have given them<br/>To the State's service, to fulfil her wishes,<br/>On the flood, in the field, or, if it must be,<br/>As it, alas! has been, to ostracism,<br/>Exile, or chains, or whatsoever worse<br/>She might decree.<br/><br/>_Mar._           And this is Patriotism?<br/>To me it seems the worst barbarity.<br/>Let me seek out my husband: the sage "Ten,"<br/>With all its jealousy, will hardly war<br/>So far with a weak woman as deny me<br/>A moment's access to his dungeon.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                          I'll<br/>So far take on myself, as order that<br/>You may be admitted.<br/><br/>_Mar._              And what shall I say<br/>To Foscari from his father?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                    That he obey<br/>The laws.<br/><br/>_Mar._   And nothing more? Will you not see him<br/>Ere he depart? It may be the last time.<br/><br/>_Doge_. The last!--my boy!--the last time I shall see<br/>My last of children! Tell him I will come.                  [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>ACT III.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_The prison of_ JACOPO FOSCARI.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ (_solus_).<br/>No light, save yon faint gleam which shows me walls<br/>Which never echoed but to Sorrow's sounds,<br/>The sigh of long imprisonment, the step<br/>Of feet on which the iron clanked the groan<br/>Of Death, the imprecation of Despair!<br/>And yet for this I have returned to Venice,<br/>With some faint hope, 'tis true, that Time, which wears<br/>The marble down, had worn away the hate<br/>Of men's hearts; but I knew them not, and here<br/>Must I consume my own, which never beat<br/>For Venice but with such a yearning as<br/>The dove has for her distant nest, when wheeling<br/>High in the air on her return to greet<br/>Her callow brood. What letters are these which<br/>                                              [_Approaching the wall_.<br/>Are scrawled along the inexorable wall?<br/>Will the gleam let me trace them? Ah! the names<br/>Of my sad predecessors in this place,<br/>The dates of their despair, the brief words of<br/>A grief too great for many. This stone page<br/>Holds like an epitaph their history;<br/>And the poor captive's tale is graven on<br/>His dungeon barrier, like the lover's record<br/>Upon the bark of some tall tree, which bears<br/>His own and his belov√©d's name. Alas!<br/>I recognise some names familiar to me,<br/>And blighted like to mine, which I will add,<br/>Fittest for such a chronicle as this,<br/>Which only can be read, as writ, by wretches.<br/>                                              [_He engraves his name_.<br/><br/>                 _Enter a Familiar of "the Ten."_<br/><br/>_Fam._ I bring you food.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._             I pray you set it down;<br/>I am past hunger: but my lips are parched--<br/>The water!<br/><br/>_Fam._    There.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ (_after drinking_). I thank you: I am better.<br/><br/>_Fam._ I am commanded to inform you that<br/>Your further trial is postponed.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                     Till when?<br/><br/>_Fam._ I know not.--It is also in my orders<br/>That your illustrious lady be admitted.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Ah! they relent, then--I had ceased to hope it:<br/>'Twas time.<br/><br/>                         _Enter_ MARINA.<br/><br/>_Mar._     My best belov√©d!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ (_embracing her_). My true wife,<br/>And only friend! What happiness!<br/><br/>_Mar._                       We'll part<br/>No more.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ How! would'st thou share a dungeon?<br/><br/>_Mar._                                         Aye,<br/>The rack, the grave, all--any thing with thee,<br/>But the tomb last of all, for there we shall<br/>Be ignorant of each other, yet I will<br/>Share that--all things except new separation;<br/>It is too much to have survived the first.<br/>How dost thou? How are those worn limbs? Alas!<br/>Why do I ask? Thy paleness----<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._               'Tis the joy<br/>Of seeing thee again so soon, and so<br/>Without expectancy, has sent the blood<br/>Back to my heart, and left my cheeks like thine,<br/>For thou art pale too, my Marina!<br/><br/>_Mar._                           'Tis<br/>The gloom of this eternal cell, which never<br/>Knew sunbeam, and the sallow sullen glare<br/>Of the familiar's torch, which seems akin<br/>To darkness more than light, by lending to<br/>The dungeon vapours its bituminous smoke,<br/>Which cloud whate'er we gaze on, even thine eyes--<br/>No, not thine eyes--they sparkle--how they sparkle!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ And thine!--but I am blinded by the torch.<br/><br/>_Mar._ As I had been without it. Couldst thou see here?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Nothing at first; but use and time had taught me<br/>Familiarity with what was darkness;<br/>And the grey twilight of such glimmerings as<br/>Glide through the crevices made by the winds<br/>Was kinder to mine eyes than the full Sun,<br/>When gorgeously o'ergilding any towers<br/>Save those of Venice; but a moment ere<br/>Thou earnest hither I was busy writing.<br/><br/>_Mar._ What?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._   My name: look, 'tis there--recorded next<br/>The name of him who here preceded me,--<br/>If dungeon dates say true.<br/><br/>_Mar._                    And what of him?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ These walls are silent of men's ends; they only<br/>Seem to hint shrewdly of them. Such stern walls<br/>Were never piled on high save o'er the dead,<br/>Or those who soon must be so.--_What of him?_<br/>Thou askest.--What of me? may soon be asked,<br/>With the like answer--doubt and dreadful surmise--<br/>Unless thou tell'st my tale.<br/><br/>_Mar._                     _I speak_ of thee!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ And wherefore not? All then shall speak of me:<br/>The tyranny of silence is not lasting,<br/>And, though events be hidden, just men's groans<br/>Will burst all cerement, even a living grave's!<br/>I do not _doubt_ my memory, but my life;<br/>And neither do I fear.<br/><br/>_Mar._                Thy life is safe.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ And liberty?<br/><br/>_Mar._                  The mind should make its own!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ That has a noble sound; but 'tis a sound,<br/>A music most impressive, but too transient:<br/>The Mind is much, but is not all. The Mind<br/>Hath nerved me to endure the risk of death,<br/>And torture positive, far worse than death<br/>(If death be a deep sleep), without a groan,<br/>Or with a cry which rather shamed my judges<br/>Than me; but 'tis not all, for there are things<br/>More woful--such as this small dungeon, where<br/>I may breathe many years.<br/><br/>_Mar._                 Alas! and this<br/>Small dungeon is all that belongs to thee<br/>Of this wide realm, of which thy sire is Prince.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ That thought would scarcely aid me to endure it.<br/>My doom is common; many are in dungeons,<br/>But none like mine, so near their father's palace;<br/>But then my heart is sometimes high, and hope<br/>Will stream along those moted rays of light<br/>Peopled with dusty atoms, which afford<br/>Our only day; for, save the gaoler's torch,<br/>And a strange firefly, which was quickly caught<br/>Last night in yon enormous spider's net,<br/>I ne'er saw aught here like a ray. Alas!<br/>I know if mind may bear us up, or no,<br/>For I have such, and shown it before men;<br/>It sinks in solitude: my soul is social.<br/><br/>_Mar._ I will be with thee.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._              Ah! if it were so!<br/>But _that_ they never granted--nor will grant,<br/>And I shall be alone: no men; no books--<br/>Those lying likenesses of lying men.<br/>I asked for even those outlines of their kind,<br/>Which they term annals, history, what you will,<br/>Which men bequeath as portraits, and they were<br/>Refused me,--so these walls have been my study,<br/>More faithful pictures of Venetian story,<br/>With all their blank, or dismal stains, than is<br/>The Hall not far from hence, which bears on high<br/>Hundreds of Doges, and their deeds and dates.<br/><br/>_Mar._ I come to tell thee the result of their<br/>Last council on thy doom.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._            I know it--look!<br/><br/>                 [_He points to his limbs, as referring to the Question<br/>                     which he had undergone_.<br/><br/>_Mar._ No--no--no more of that: even they relent<br/>From that atrocity.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._      What then?<br/><br/>_Mar._                       That you<br/>Return to Candia.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._      Then my last hope's gone.<br/>I could endure my dungeon, for 'twas Venice;<br/>I could support the torture, there was something<br/>In my native air that buoyed my spirits up<br/>Like a ship on the Ocean tossed by storms,<br/>But proudly still bestriding the high waves,<br/>And holding on its course; but _there_, afar,<br/>In that accurs√©d isle of slaves and captives,<br/>And unbelievers, like a stranded wreck,<br/>My very soul seemed mouldering in my bosom,<br/>And piecemeal I shall perish, if remanded.<br/><br/>_Mar._ And _here_?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._         At once--by better means, as briefer.<br/>What! would they even deny me my Sire's sepulchre,<br/>As well as home and heritage?<br/><br/>_Mar._                       My husband!<br/>I have sued to accompany thee hence,<br/>And not so hopelessly. This love of thine<br/>For an ungrateful and tyrannic soil<br/>Is Passion, and not Patriotism; for me,<br/>So I could see thee with a quiet aspect,<br/>And the sweet freedom of the earth and air,<br/>I would not cavil about climes or regions.<br/>This crowd of palaces and prisons is not<br/>A Paradise; its first inhabitants<br/>Were wretched exiles.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._          Well I know _how_ wretched!<br/><br/>_Mar._ And yet you see how, from their banishment<br/>Before the Tartar into these salt isles,<br/>Their antique energy of mind, all that<br/>Remained of Rome for their inheritance,<br/>Created by degrees an ocean Rome;<br/>And shall an evil, which so often leads<br/>To good, depress thee thus?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                Had I gone forth<br/>From my own land, like the old patriarchs, seeking<br/>Another region, with their flocks and herds;<br/>Had I been cast out like the Jews from Zion,<br/>Or like our fathers, driven by Attila<br/>From fertile Italy, to barren islets,<br/>I would have given some tears to my late country<br/>And many thoughts; but afterwards addressed<br/>Myself, with those about me, to create<br/>A new home and fresh state: perhaps I could<br/>Have borne this--though I know not.<br/><br/>_Mar._                             Wherefore not?<br/>It was the lot of millions, and must be<br/>The fate of myriads more.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._              Aye--we but hear<br/>Of the survivors' toil in their new lands,<br/>Their numbers and success; but who can number<br/>The hearts which broke in silence at that parting,<br/>Or after their departure; of that malady<br/>Which calls up green and native fields to view<br/>From the rough deep, with such identity<br/>To the poor exile's fevered eye, that he<br/>Can scarcely be restrained from treading them?<br/>That melody, which out of tones and tunes<br/>Collects such pasture for the longing sorrow<br/>Of the sad mountaineer, when far away<br/>From his snow canopy of cliffs and clouds,<br/>That he feeds on the sweet, but poisonous thought,<br/>And dies. You call this _weakness_! It is strength,<br/>I say,--the parent of all honest feeling.<br/>He who loves not his Country, can love nothing.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Obey her, then: 'tis she that puts thee forth.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Aye, there it is; 'tis like a mother's curse<br/>Upon my soul--the mark is set upon me.<br/>The exiles you speak of went forth by nations,<br/>Their hands upheld each other by the way,<br/>Their tents were pitched together--I'm alone.<br/><br/>_Mar._ You shall be so no more--I will go with thee.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ My best Marina!--and our children?<br/><br/>_Mar._                                        They,<br/>I fear, by the prevention of the state's<br/>Abhorrent policy, (which holds all ties<br/>As threads, which may be broken at her pleasure),<br/>Will not be suffered to proceed with us.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ And canst thou leave them?<br/><br/>_Mar._                                Yes--with many a pang!<br/>But--I _can_ leave them, children as they are,<br/>To teach you to be less a child. From this<br/>Learn you to sway your feelings, when exacted<br/>By duties paramount; and 'tis our first<br/>On earth to bear.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._      Have I not borne?<br/><br/>_Mar._                            Too much<br/>From tyrannous injustice, and enough<br/>To teach you not to shrink now from a lot,<br/>Which, as compared with what you have undergone<br/>Of late, is mercy.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._       Ah! you never yet<br/>Were far away from Venice, never saw<br/>Her beautiful towers in the receding distance,<br/>While every furrow of the vessel's track<br/>Seemed ploughing deep into your heart; you never<br/>Saw day go down upon your native spires<br/>So calmly with its gold and crimson glory,<br/>And after dreaming a disturb√©d vision<br/>Of them and theirs, awoke and found them not.<br/><br/>_Mar._ I will divide this with you. Let us think<br/>Of our departure from this much-loved city,<br/>(Since you must _love_ it, as it seems,) and this<br/>Chamber of state, her gratitude allots you.<br/>Our children will be cared for by the Doge,<br/>And by my uncles; we must sail ere night.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ That's sudden. Shall I not behold my father?<br/><br/>_Mar._ You will.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._     Where?<br/><br/>_Mar._                Here, or in the ducal chamber--<br/>He said not which. I would that you could bear<br/>Your exile as he bears it.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._               Blame him not.<br/>I sometimes murmur for a moment; but<br/>He could not now act otherwise. A show<br/>Of feeling or compassion on his part<br/>Would have but drawn upon his ag√©d head<br/>Suspicion from "the Ten," and upon mine<br/>Accumulated ills.<br/><br/>_Mar._           Accumulated!<br/>What pangs are those they have spared you?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                               That of leaving<br/>Venice without beholding him or you,<br/>Which might have been forbidden now, as 'twas<br/>Upon my former exile.<br/><br/>_Mar._               That is true,<br/>And thus far I am also the State's debtor,<br/>And shall be more so when I see us both<br/>Floating on the free waves--away--away--<br/>Be it to the earth's end, from this abhorred,<br/>Unjust, and----<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._    Curse it not. If I am silent,<br/>Who dares accuse my Country?<br/><br/>_Mar._                     Men and Angels!<br/>The blood of myriads reeking up to Heaven,<br/>The groans of slaves in chains, and men in dungeons,<br/>Mothers, and wives, and sons, and sires, and subjects,<br/>Held in the bondage of ten bald-heads; and<br/>Though last, not least, _thy silence! Couldst thou_ say<br/>Aught in its favour, who would praise like _thee_?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Let us address us then, since so it must be,<br/>To our departure. Who comes here?<br/><br/>            _Enter_ LOREDANO _attended by Familiars_.<br/><br/>_Lor._ (_to the Familiars_).       Retire,<br/>But leave the torch.                      [_Exeunt the two Familiars_.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._         Most welcome, noble Signor.<br/>I did not deem this poor place could have drawn<br/>Such presence hither.<br/><br/>_Lor._               'Tis not the first time<br/>I have visited these places.<br/><br/>_Mar._                      Nor would be<br/>The last, were all men's merits well rewarded.<br/>Came you here to insult us, or remain<br/>As spy upon us, or as hostage for us?<br/><br/>_Lor._ Neither are of my office, noble Lady!<br/>I am sent hither to your husband, to<br/>Announce "the Ten's" decree.<br/><br/>_Mar._                      That tenderness<br/>Has been anticipated: it is known.<br/><br/>_Lor._ As how?<br/><br/>_Mar._         I have informed him, not so gently,<br/>Doubtless, as your nice feelings would prescribe,<br/>The indulgence of your colleagues; but he knew it.<br/>If you come for our thanks, take them, and hence!<br/>The dungeon gloom is deep enough without you,<br/>And full of reptiles, not less loathsome, though<br/>Their sting is honester.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._             I pray you, calm you:<br/>What can avail such words?<br/><br/>_Mar._                   To let him know<br/>That he is known.<br/><br/>_Lor._           Let the fair dame preserve<br/>Her sex's privilege.<br/><br/>_Mar._              I have some sons, sir,<br/>Will one day thank you better.<br/><br/>_Lor._                        You do well<br/>To nurse them wisely. Foscari--you know<br/>Your sentence, then?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._        Return to Candia?<br/><br/>_Lor._                               True--<br/>For life.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Not long.<br/><br/>_Lor._               I said--for _life_.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                              And I<br/>Repeat--not long.<br/><br/>_Lor._        A year's imprisonment<br/>In Canea--afterwards the freedom of<br/>The whole isle.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._      Both the same to me: the after<br/>Freedom as is the first imprisonment.<br/>Is't true my wife accompanies me?<br/><br/>_Lor._                           Yes,<br/>If she so wills it.<br/><br/>_Mar._             Who obtained that justice?<br/><br/>_Lor._ One who wars not with women.<br/><br/>_Mar._                              But oppresses<br/>Men: howsoever let him have _my_ thanks<br/>For the only boon I would have asked or taken<br/>From him or such as he is.<br/><br/>_Lor._                    He receives them<br/>As they are offered.<br/><br/>_Mar._              May they thrive with him<br/>So much!--no more.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._        Is this, sir, your whole mission?<br/>Because we have brief time for preparation,<br/>And you perceive your presence doth disquiet<br/>This lady, of a house noble as yours.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Nobler!<br/><br/>_Lor._          How nobler?<br/><br/>_Mar._                     As more generous!<br/>We say the "generous steed" to express the purity<br/>Of his high blood. Thus much I've learnt, although<br/>Venetian (who see few steeds save of bronze),<br/>From those Venetians who have skirred the coasts<br/>Of Egypt and her neighbour Araby:<br/>And why not say as soon the "_generous man_?"<br/>If race be aught, it is in qualities<br/>More than in years; and mine, which is as old<br/>As yours, is better in its product, nay--<br/>Look not so stern--but get you back, and pore<br/>Upon your genealogic tree's most green<br/>Of leaves and most mature of fruits, and there<br/>Blush to find ancestors, who would have blushed<br/>For such a son--thou cold inveterate hater!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Again, Marina!<br/><br/>_Mar._                       Again! _still_, Marina.<br/>See you not, he comes here to glut his hate<br/>With a last look upon our misery?<br/>Let him partake it!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._       That were difficult.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Nothing more easy. He partakes it now--<br/>Aye, he may veil beneath a marble brow<br/>And sneering lip the pang, but he partakes it.<br/>A few brief words of truth shame the Devil's servants<br/>No less than Master; I have probed his soul<br/>A moment, as the Eternal Fire, ere long,<br/>Will reach it always. See how he shrinks from me!<br/>With death, and chains, and exile in his hand,<br/>To scatter o'er his kind as he thinks fit;<br/>They are his weapons, not his armour, for<br/>I have pierced him to the core of his cold heart.<br/>I care not for his frowns! We can but die,<br/>And he but live, for him the very worst<br/>Of destinies: each day secures him more<br/>His tempter's.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._     This is mere insanity.<br/><br/>_Mar._ It may be so; and _who_ hath made us _mad_?<br/><br/>_Lor._ Let her go on; it irks not me.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                 That's false!<br/>You came here to enjoy a heartless triumph<br/>Of cold looks upon manifold griefs! You came<br/>To be sued to in vain--to mark our tears,<br/>And hoard our groans--to gaze upon the wreck<br/>Which you have made a Prince's son--my husband;<br/>In short, to trample on the fallen--an office<br/>The hangman shrinks from, as all men from him!<br/>How have you sped? We are wretched, Signor, as<br/>Your plots could make, and vengeance could desire us,<br/>And how _feel you_?<br/><br/>_Lor._             As rocks.<br/><br/>_Mar._                       By thunder blasted:<br/>They feel not, but no less are shivered. Come,<br/>Foscari; now let us go, and leave this felon,<br/>The sole fit habitant of such a cell,<br/>Which he has peopled often, but ne'er fitly<br/>Till he himself shall brood in it alone.<br/><br/>                        _Enter the_ DOGE.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ My father!<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_embracing him_). Jacopo! my son--my son!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ My father still! How long it is since I<br/>Have heard thee name my name--_our_ name!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                  My boy!<br/>Couldst thou but know----<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._              I rarely, sir, have murmured.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I feel too much thou hast not.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                Doge, look there!<br/>                                            [_She points to_ LOREDANO.<br/><br/>_Doge_. I see the man--what mean'st thou?<br/><br/>_Mar._                                   Caution!<br/><br/>_Lor._                                           Being<br/>The virtue which this noble lady most<br/>May practise, she doth well to recommend it.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Wretch! 'tis no virtue, but the policy<br/>Of those who fain must deal perforce with vice:<br/>As such I recommend it, as I would<br/>To one whose foot was on an adder's path.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Daughter, it is superfluous; I have long<br/>Known Loredano.<br/><br/>_Lor._         You may know him better.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Yes; _worse_ he could not.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                      Father, let not these<br/>Our parting hours be lost in listening to<br/>Reproaches, which boot nothing. Is it--is it,<br/>Indeed, our last of meetings?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                      You behold<br/>These white hairs!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._     And I feel, besides, that mine<br/>Will never be so white. Embrace me, father!<br/>I loved you ever--never more than now.<br/>Look to my children--to your last child's children:<br/>Let them be all to you which he was once,<br/>And never be to you what I am now.<br/>May I not see _them_ also?<br/><br/>_Mar._                    No--not _here_.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ They might behold their parent any where.<br/><br/>_Mar._ I would that they beheld their father in<br/>A place which would not mingle fear with love,<br/>To freeze their young blood in its natural current.<br/>They have fed well, slept soft, and knew not that<br/>Their sire was a mere hunted outlaw. Well,<br/>I know his fate may one day be their heritage,<br/>But let it only be their _heritage_,<br/>And not their present fee. Their senses, though<br/>Alive to love, are yet awake to terror;<br/>And these vile damps, too, and yon _thick green_ wave<br/>Which floats above the place where we now stand--<br/>A cell so far below the water's level,<br/>Sending its pestilence through every crevice,<br/>Might strike them: _this is not their_ atmosphere,<br/>However you--and you--and most of all,<br/>As worthiest--_you_, sir, noble Loredano!<br/>May breathe it without prejudice.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                      I had not<br/>Reflected upon this, but acquiesce.<br/>I shall depart, then, without meeting them?<br/><br/>_Doge_. Not so: they shall await you in my chamber.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ And must I leave them--_all_?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                    You must.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                                        Not one?<br/><br/>_Lor._ They are the State's.<br/><br/>_Mar._                      I thought they had been mine.<br/><br/>_Lor._ They are, in all maternal things.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                   That is,<br/>In all things painful. If they're sick, they will<br/>Be left to me to tend them; should they die,<br/>To me to bury and to mourn; but if<br/>They live, they'll make you soldiers, senators,<br/>Slaves, exiles--what _you_ will; or if they are<br/>Females with portions, brides and _bribes_ for nobles!<br/>Behold the State's care for its sons and mothers!<br/><br/>_Lor._ The hour approaches, and the wind is fair.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ How know you that here, where the genial wind<br/>Ne'er blows in all its blustering freedom?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                   'Twas so<br/>When I came here. The galley floats within<br/>A bow-shot of the "Riva di Schiavoni."<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Father! I pray you to precede me, and<br/>Prepare my children to behold their father.<br/><br/>_Doge_. Be firm, my son!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._             I will do my endeavour.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Farewell! at least to this detested dungeon,<br/>And him to whose good offices you owe<br/>In part your past imprisonment.<br/><br/>_Lor._                         And present<br/>Liberation.<br/><br/>_Doge_.    He speaks truth.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                No doubt! but 'tis<br/>Exchange of chains for heavier chains I owe him.<br/>He knows this, or he had not sought to change them,<br/>But I reproach not.<br/><br/>_Lor._           The time narrows, Signor.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Alas! I little thought so lingeringly<br/>To leave abodes like this: but when I feel<br/>That every step I take, even from this cell,<br/>Is one away from Venice, I look back<br/>Even on these dull damp walls, and----<br/><br/>_Doge_.                               Boy! no tears.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Let them flow on: he wept not on the rack<br/>To shame him, and they cannot shame him now.<br/>They will relieve his heart--that too kind heart--<br/>And I will find an hour to wipe away<br/>Those tears, or add my own. I could weep now,<br/>But would not gratify yon wretch so far.<br/>Let us proceed. Doge, lead the way.<br/><br/>_Lor._ (_to the Familiar_).        The torch, there!<br/><br/>_Mar._ Yes, light us on, as to a funeral pyre,<br/>With Loredano mourning like an heir.<br/><br/>_Doge_. My son, you are feeble; take this hand.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                                    Alas!<br/>Must youth support itself on age, and I<br/>Who ought to be the prop of yours?<br/><br/>_Lor._                            Take mine.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Touch it not, Foscari; 'twill sting you. Signor,<br/>Stand off! be sure, that if a grasp of yours<br/>Would raise us from the gulf wherein we are plunged,<br/>No hand of ours would stretch itself to meet it.<br/>Come, Foscari, take the hand the altar gave you;<br/>It could not save, but will support you ever.               [_Exeunt_.<br/><br/>ACT IV.<br/><br/>SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Ducal Palace_.<br/><br/>                _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.<br/><br/>_Bar._ And have you confidence in such a project?<br/><br/>_Lor._ I have.<br/><br/>_Bar._         'Tis hard upon his years.<br/><br/>_Lor._                                  Say rather<br/>Kind to relieve him from the cares of State.<br/><br/>_Bar._ 'Twill break his heart.<br/><br/>_Lor._                        Age has no heart to break.<br/>He has seen his son's half broken, and, except<br/>A start of feeling in his dungeon, never<br/>Swerved.<br/><br/>_Bar._   In his countenance, I grant you, never;<br/>But I have seen him sometimes in a calm<br/>So desolate, that the most clamorous grief<br/>Had nought to envy him within. Where is he?<br/><br/>_Lor._ In his own portion of the palace, with<br/>His son, and the whole race of Foscaris.<br/><br/>_Bar._ Bidding farewell.<br/><br/>_Lor._                   A last! as, soon, he shall<br/>Bid to his Dukedom.<br/><br/>_Bar._             When embarks the son?<br/><br/>_Lor._ Forthwith--when this long leave is taken. 'Tis<br/>Time to admonish them again.<br/><br/>_Bar._                      Forbear;<br/>Retrench not from their moments.<br/><br/>_Lor._                          Not I, now<br/>We have higher business for our own. This day<br/>Shall be the last of the old Doge's reign,<br/>As the first of his son's last banishment,<br/>And that is vengeance.<br/><br/>_Bar._                In my mind, too deep.<br/><br/>_Lor._ 'Tis moderate--not even life for life, the rule<br/>Denounced of retribution from all time;<br/>They owe me still my father's and my uncle's.<br/><br/>_Bar._ Did not the Doge deny this strongly?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                      Doubtless.<br/><br/>_Bar._ And did not this shake your suspicion?<br/><br/>_Lor._                                        No.<br/><br/>_Bar._ But if this deposition should take place<br/>By our united influence in the Council,<br/>It must be done with all the deference<br/>Due to his years, his station, and his deeds.<br/><br/>_Lor._ As much of ceremony as you will,<br/>So that the thing be done. You may, for aught<br/>I care, depute the Council on their knees,<br/>(Like Barbarossa to the Pope,) to beg him<br/>To have the courtesy to abdicate.<br/><br/>_Bar._ What if he will not?<br/><br/>_Lor._                      We'll elect another,<br/>And make him null.<br/><br/>_Bar._            But will the laws uphold us?<br/><br/>_Lor._ What laws?--"The Ten" are laws; and if they were not,<br/>I will be legislator in this business.<br/><br/>_Bar._ At your own peril?<br/><br/>_Lor._                   There is none, I tell you,<br/>Our powers are such.<br/><br/>_Bar._              But he has twice already<br/>Solicited permission to retire,<br/>And twice it was refused.<br/><br/>_Lor._                  The better reason<br/>To grant it the third time.<br/><br/>_Bar._                     Unasked?<br/><br/>_Lor._                             It shows<br/>The impression of his former instances:<br/>If they were from his heart, he may be thankful:<br/>If not, 'twill punish his hypocrisy.<br/>Come, they are met by this time; let us join them,<br/>And be _thou_ fixed in purpose for this once.<br/>I have prepared such arguments as will not<br/>Fail to move them, and to remove him: since<br/>Their thoughts, their objects, have been sounded, do not<br/>_You_, with your wonted scruples, teach us pause,<br/>And all will prosper.<br/><br/>_Bar._               Could I but be certain<br/>This is no prelude to such persecution<br/>Of the sire as has fallen upon the son,<br/>I would support you.<br/><br/>_Lor._              He is safe, I tell you;<br/>His fourscore years and five may linger on<br/>As long as he can drag them: 'tis his throne<br/>Alone is aimed at.<br/><br/>_Bar._            But discarded Princes<br/>Are seldom long of life.<br/><br/>_Lor._                  And men of eighty<br/>More seldom still.<br/><br/>_Bar._            And why not wait these few years?<br/><br/>_Lor._ Because we have waited long enough, and he<br/>Lived longer than enough.

I say no more.<br/><br/>_Mem._                          As we hope, Signor,<br/>And all may honestly, (that is, all those<br/>Of noble blood may,) one day hope to be<br/>Decemvir, it is surely for the Senate's<br/>Chosen delegates, a school of wisdom, to<br/>Be thus admitted, though as novices,<br/>To view the mysteries.<br/><br/>_Sen._                Let us view them: they,<br/>No doubt, are worth it.<br/><br/>_Mem._                 Being worth our lives<br/>If we divulge them, doubtless they are worth<br/>Something, at least to you or me.<br/><br/>_Sen._                           I sought not<br/>A place within the sanctuary; but being<br/>Chosen, however reluctantly so chosen,<br/>I shall fulfil my office.<br/><br/>_Mem._                   Let us not<br/>Be latest in obeying "the Ten's" summons.<br/><br/>_Sen._ All are not met, but I am of your thought<br/>So far--let's in.<br/><br/>_Mem._          The earliest are most welcome<br/>In earnest councils--we will not be least so.

Son Jacopo,<br/>Go and obey our Country's will: 'tis not<br/>For us to look beyond.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._        But still I must<br/>Look back. I pray you think of me.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                           Alas!<br/>You ever were my dearest offspring, when<br/>They were more numerous, nor can be less so<br/>Now you are last; but did the State demand<br/>The exile of the disinterr√©d ashes<br/>Of your three goodly brothers, now in earth,<br/>And their desponding shades came flitting round<br/>To impede the act, I must no less obey<br/>A duty, paramount to every duty.<br/><br/>_Mar._ My husband! let us on: this but prolongs<br/>Our sorrow.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ But we are not summoned yet;<br/>The galley's sails are not unfurled:--who knows?<br/>The wind may change.<br/><br/>_Mar._              And if it do, it will not<br/>Change _their_ hearts, or your lot: the galley's oars<br/>Will quickly clear the harbour.<br/><br/>_Jac.

Fos._           Never yet did mariner<br/>Put up to patron saint such prayers for prosperous<br/>And pleasant breezes, as I call upon you,<br/>Ye tutelar saints of my own city! which<br/>Ye love not with more holy love than I,<br/>To lash up from the deep the Adrian waves,<br/>And waken Auster, sovereign of the Tempest!<br/>Till the sea dash me back on my own shore<br/>A broken corse upon the barren Lido,<br/>Where I may mingle with the sands which skirt<br/>The land I love, and never shall see more!<br/><br/>_Mar._ And wish you this with _me_ beside you?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                                   No--<br/>No--not for thee, too good, too kind! May'st thou<br/>Live long to be a mother to those children<br/>Thy fond fidelity for a time deprives<br/>Of such support! But for myself alone,<br/>May all the winds of Heaven howl down the Gulf,<br/>And tear the vessel, till the mariners,<br/>Appalled, turn their despairing eyes on me,<br/>As the Phenicians did on Jonah, then<br/>Cast me out from amongst them, as an offering<br/>To appease the waves. The billow which destroys me<br/>Will be more merciful than man, and bear me<br/>Dead, but _still bear_ me to a native grave,<br/>From fishers' hands, upon the desolate strand,<br/>Which, of its thousand wrecks, hath ne'er received<br/>One lacerated like the heart which then<br/>Will be.--But wherefore breaks it not? why live I?<br/><br/>_Mar._ To man thyself, I trust, with time, to master<br/>Such useless passion. Until now thou wert<br/>A sufferer, but not a loud one: why<br/>What is this to the things thou hast borne in silence--<br/>Imprisonment and actual torture?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                     Double,<br/>Triple, and tenfold torture! But you are right,<br/>It must be borne. Father, your blessing.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                             Would<br/>It could avail thee! but no less thou hast it.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ Forgive----<br/><br/>_Doge_.                What?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                  My poor mother, for my birth,<br/>And me for having lived, and you yourself<br/>(As I forgive you), for the gift of life,<br/>Which you bestowed upon me as my sire.<br/><br/>_Mar._   What hast thou done?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                  Nothing. I cannot charge<br/>My memory with much save sorrow: but<br/>I have been so beyond the common lot<br/>Chastened and visited, I needs must think<br/>That I was wicked. If it be so, may<br/>What I have undergone here keep me from<br/>A like hereafter!<br/><br/>_Mar._           Fear not: _that's_ reserved<br/>For your oppressors.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._         Let me hope not.<br/><br/>_Mar._                               Hope not?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ I cannot wish them _all_ they have inflicted.<br/><br/>_Mar._ _All!_ the consummate fiends! A thousandfold<br/>May the worm which never dieth feed upon them!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ They may repent.<br/><br/>_Mar._                       And if they do, Heaven will not<br/>Accept the tardy penitence of demons.<br/><br/>                  _Enter an Officer and Guards_.<br/><br/>_Offi._ Signor! the boat is at the shore--the wind<br/>Is rising--we are ready to attend you.<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ And I to be attended. Once more, father,<br/>Your hand!<br/><br/>_Doge_.   Take it. Alas! how thine own trembles!<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._ No--you mistake; 'tis yours that shakes, my father.<br/>Farewell!<br/><br/>_Doge_.  Farewell! Is there aught else?<br/><br/>_Jac. Fos._                            No--nothing.<br/>                                                    [_To the Officer_.<br/>Lend me your arm, good Signor.<br/><br/>_Offi._                       You turn pale--<br/>Let me support you--paler--ho! some aid there!<br/>Some water!<br/><br/>_Mar._      Ah, he is dying!<br/><br/>_Jac.

Inform the Signory from _me_, the Doge,<br/>They have no further power upon those ashes:<br/>While he lived, he was theirs, as fits a subject--<br/>Now he is _mine_--my broken-hearted boy!              [_Exit Officer_.<br/><br/>_Mar._ And I must live!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                 Your children live, Marina.<br/><br/>_Mar._ My children! true--they live, and I must live<br/>To bring them up to serve the State, and die<br/>As died their father.

Avaunt!<br/>Incarnate Lucifer! 'tis holy ground.<br/>A martyr's ashes now lie there, which make it<br/>A shrine. Get thee back to thy place of torment!<br/><br/>_Bar._ Lady, we knew not of this sad event,<br/>But passed here merely on our path from council.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Pass on.<br/><br/>_Lor._          We sought the Doge.<br/><br/>_Mar._ (_pointing to the Doge, who is still on the ground<br/>by his son's body_)                 He's busy, look,<br/>About the business _you_ provided for him.<br/>Are ye content?<br/><br/>_Bar._         We will not interrupt<br/>A parent's sorrows.<br/><br/>_Mar._             No, ye only make them,<br/>Then leave them.<br/><br/>_Doge_ (_rising_).

When I twice before reiterated<br/>My wish to abdicate, it was refused me:<br/>And not alone refused, but ye exacted<br/>An oath from me that I would never more<br/>Renew this instance. I have sworn to die<br/>In full exertion of the functions, which<br/>My Country called me here to exercise,<br/>According to my honour and my conscience--<br/>I cannot break _my_ oath.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_.      Reduce us not<br/>To the alternative of a decree,<br/>Instead of your compliance.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                    Providence<br/>Prolongs my days to prove and chasten me;<br/>But ye have no right to reproach my length<br/>Of days, since every hour has been the Country's.<br/>I am ready to lay down my life for her,<br/>As I have laid down dearer things than life:<br/>But for my dignity--I hold it of<br/>The _whole_ Republic: when the _general_ will<br/>Is manifest, then you shall all be answered.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. We grieve for such an answer; but it cannot<br/>Avail you aught.<br/><br/>_Doge_.         I can submit to all things,<br/>But nothing will advance; no, not a moment.<br/>What you decree--decree.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_.       With this, then, must we<br/>Return to those who sent us?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                     You have heard me.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. With all due reverence we retire.<br/>                                        [_Exeunt the Deputation, etc._<br/><br/>                       _Enter an Attendant_.<br/><br/>_Att._                                                My Lord,<br/>The noble dame Marina craves an audience.<br/><br/>_Doge_. My time is hers.<br/><br/>                         _Enter_ MARINA.<br/><br/>_Mar._                    My Lord, if I intrude--<br/>Perhaps you fain would be alone?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                          Alone!<br/>Alone, come all the world around me, I<br/>Am now and evermore. But we will bear it.<br/><br/>_Mar._ We will, and for the sake of those who are,<br/>Endeavour----Oh, my husband!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                      Give it way:<br/>I cannot comfort thee.<br/><br/>_Mar._                  He might have lived,<br/>So formed for gentle privacy of life,<br/>So loving, so beloved; the native of<br/>Another land, and who so blest and blessing<br/>As my poor Foscari? Nothing was wanting<br/>Unto his happiness and mine save not<br/>To be Venetian.<br/><br/>_Doge_.          Or a Prince's son.<br/><br/>_Mar._ Yes; all things which conduce to other men's<br/>Imperfect happiness or high ambition,<br/>By some strange destiny, to him proved deadly.<br/>The Country and the People whom he loved,<br/>The Prince of whom he was the elder born,<br/>And----<br/><br/>_Doge_.   Soon may be a Prince no longer.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                    How?<br/><br/>_Doge_. They have taken my son from me, and now aim<br/>At my too long worn diadem and ring.<br/>Let them resume the gewgaws!<br/><br/>_Mar._                       Oh, the tyrants!<br/>In such an hour too!<br/><br/>_Doge_.              'Tis the fittest time;<br/>An hour ago I should have felt it.<br/><br/>_Mar._                             And<br/>Will you not now resent it?--Oh, for vengeance!<br/>But he, who, had he been enough protected,<br/>Might have repaid protection in this moment,<br/>Cannot assist his father.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   Nor should do so<br/>Against his Country, had he a thousand lives<br/>Instead of that----<br/><br/>_Mar._            They tortured from him. This<br/>May be pure patriotism. I am a woman:<br/>To me my husband and my children were<br/>Country and home. I loved _him_--how I loved him!<br/>I have seen him pass through such an ordeal as<br/>The old martyrs would have shrunk from: he is gone,<br/>And I, who would have given my blood for him,<br/>Have nought to give but tears! But could I compass<br/>The retribution of his wrongs!--Well, well!<br/>I have sons, who shall be men.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                       Your grief distracts you.<br/><br/>_Mar._ I thought I could have borne it, when I saw him<br/>Bowed down by such oppression; yes, I thought<br/>That I would rather look upon his corse<br/>Than his prolonged captivity:--I am punished<br/>For that thought now. Would I were in his grave!<br/><br/>_Doge_. I must look on him once more.<br/><br/>_Mar._                                 Come with me!<br/><br/>_Doge_. Is he----<br/><br/>_Mar._            Our bridal bed is now his bier,<br/><br/>_Doge_. And he is in his shroud!<br/><br/>_Mar._                           Come, come, old man!<br/>                                      [_Exeunt the_ DOGE _and_ MARINA.<br/><br/>                _Enter_ BARBARIGO _and_ LOREDANO.<br/><br/>_Bar._ (_to an Attendant_).

I have obeyed your summons.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. We come once more to urge our past request.<br/><br/>_Doge_. And I to answer.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_.       What?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                        My only answer.<br/>You have heard it.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. Hear _you_ then the last decree,<br/>Definitive and absolute!<br/><br/>_Doge_.                 To the point--<br/>To the point! I know of old the forms of office,<br/>And gentle preludes to strong acts.--Go on!<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. You are no longer Doge; you are released<br/>From your imperial oath as Sovereign;<br/>Your ducal robes must be put off; but for<br/>Your services, the State allots the appanage<br/>Already mentioned in our former congress.<br/>Three days are left you to remove from hence,<br/>Under the penalty to see confiscated<br/>All your own private fortune.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                      That last clause,<br/>I am proud to say, would not enrich the treasury.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. Your answer, Duke!<br/><br/>_Lor._                                 Your answer, Francis Foscari!<br/><br/>_Doge_. If I could have foreseen that my old age<br/>Was prejudicial to the State, the Chief<br/>Of the Republic never would have shown<br/>Himself so far ungrateful, as to place<br/>His own high dignity before his Country;<br/>But this _life_ having been so many years<br/>_Not_ useless to that Country, I would fain<br/>Have consecrated my last moments to her.<br/>But the decree being rendered, I obey.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. If you would have the three days named extended,<br/>We willingly will lengthen them to eight,<br/>As sign of our esteem.<br/><br/>_Doge_.

True; but in freedom,<br/>Without these jealous spies upon the great.<br/>Signers, you may depart: what would you more?<br/>We are going; do you fear that we shall bear<br/>The palace with us? Its _old_ walls, ten times<br/>As _old_ as I am, and I'm very old,<br/>Have served you, so have I, and I and they<br/>Could tell a tale; but I invoke them not<br/>To fall upon you! else they would, as erst<br/>The pillars of stone Dagon's temple on<br/>The Israelite and his Philistine foes.<br/>Such power I do believe there might exist<br/>In such a curse as mine, provoked by such<br/>As you; but I curse not.

Earth and Heaven!<br/>Ye will reverberate this peal; and I<br/>Live to hear this!--the first Doge who e'er heard<br/>Such sound for his successor: happier he,<br/>My attainted predecessor, stern Faliero--<br/>This insult at the least was spared him.<br/><br/>_Lor._                                   What!<br/>Do you regret a traitor?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                   No--I merely<br/>Envy the dead.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_.   My Lord, if you indeed<br/>Are bent upon this rash abandonment<br/>Of the State's palace, at the least retire<br/>By the private staircase, which conducts you towards<br/>The landing-place of the canal.<br/><br/>_Doge_.                         No. I<br/>Will now descend the stairs by which I mounted<br/>To sovereignty--the Giants' Stairs, on whose<br/>Broad eminence I was invested Duke.<br/>My services have called me up those steps,<br/>The malice of my foes will drive me down them.<br/>_There_ five and thirty years ago was I<br/>Installed, and traversed these same halls, from which<br/>I never thought to be divorced except<br/>A corse--a corse, it might be, fighting for them--<br/>But not pushed hence by fellow-citizens.<br/>But come; my son and I will go together--<br/>He to his grave, and I to pray for mine.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. What! thus in public?<br/><br/>_Doge_.                                  I was publicly<br/>Elected, and so will I be deposed.<br/>Marina! art thou willing?<br/><br/>_Mar._                   Here's my arm!<br/><br/>_Doge_. And here my _staff_: thus propped will I go forth.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_. It must not be--the people will perceive it.<br/><br/>_Doge_. The people,--There's no people, you well know it,<br/>Else you dare not deal thus by them or me.<br/>There is a _populace_, perhaps, whose looks<br/>May shame you; but they dare not groan nor curse you,<br/>Save with their hearts and eyes.<br/><br/>_Chief of the Ten_.               You speak in passion,<br/>Else----<br/><br/>_Doge_. You have reason. I have spoken much<br/>More than my wont: it is a foible which<br/>Was not of mine, but more excuses you,<br/>Inasmuch as it shows, that I approach<br/>A dotage which may justify this deed<br/>Of yours, although the law does not, nor will.<br/>Farewell, sirs!<br/><br/>_Bar._         You shall not depart without<br/>An escort fitting past and present rank.<br/>We will accompany, with due respect,<br/>The Doge unto his private palace.

Then it is false, or you are true.<br/>For my own part, I credit neither; 'tis<br/>An idle legend.<br/><br/>_Mar._          You talk wildly, and<br/>Had better now be seated, nor as yet<br/>Depart.
