# üíÆ Ode to Naples by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    EPODE 1a.<br/><br/>I stood within the City disinterred;<br/>And heard the autumnal leaves like light footfalls<br/>Of spirits passing through the streets; and heard<br/>The Mountain's slumberous voice at intervals<br/>Thrill through those roofless halls;<br/>The oracular thunder penetrating shook<br/>The listening soul in my suspended blood;<br/>I felt that Earth out of her deep heart spoke--<br/>I felt, but heard not:--through white columns glowed<br/>The isle-sustaining ocean-flood,<br/>A plane of light between two heavens of azure!<br/>Around me gleamed many a bright sepulchre<br/>Of whose pure beauty, Time, as if his pleasure<br/>Were to spare Death, had never made erasure;<br/>But every living lineament was clear<br/>As in the sculptor's thought; and there<br/>The wreaths of stony myrtle, ivy, and pine,<br/>Like winter leaves o'ergrown by moulded snow,<br/>Seemed only not to move and grow<br/>Because the crystal silence of the air<br/>Weighed on their life; even as the Power divine<br/>Which then lulled all things, brooded upon mine.<br/><br/>EPODE 2a.<br/><br/>Then gentle winds arose<br/>With many a mingled close<br/>Of wild Aeolian sound, and mountain-odours keen;<br/>And where the Baian ocean<br/>Welters with airlike motion,<br/>Within, above, around its bowers of starry green,<br/>Moving the sea-flowers in those purple caves,<br/>Even as the ever stormless atmosphere<br/>Floats o'er the Elysian realm,<br/>It bore me, like an Angel, o'er the waves<br/>Of sunlight, whose swift pinnace of dewy air<br/>No storm can overwhelm.<br/>I sailed, where ever flows<br/>Under the calm Serene<br/>A spirit of deep emotion<br/>From the unknown graves<br/>Of the dead Kings of Melody.<br/>Shadowy Aornos darkened o'er the helm<br/>The horizontal aether; Heaven stripped bare<br/>Its depth over Elysium, where the prow<br/>Made the invisible water white as snow;<br/>From that Typhaean mount, Inarime,<br/>There streamed a sunbright vapour, like the standard<br/>Of some aethereal host;<br/>Whilst from all the coast,<br/>Louder and louder, gathering round, there wandered<br/>Over the oracular woods and divine sea<br/>Prophesyings which grew articulate--<br/>They seize me--I must speak them!--be they fate!<br/><br/>STROPHE 1.<br/><br/>Naples! thou Heart of men which ever pantest<br/>Naked, beneath the lidless eye of Heaven!<br/>Elysian City, which to calm enchantest<br/>The mutinous air and sea! they round thee, even<br/>As sleep round Love, are driven!<br/>Metropolis of a ruined Paradise<br/>Long lost, late won, and yet but half regained!<br/>Bright Altar of the bloodless sacrifice<br/>Which armed Victory offers up unstained<br/>To Love, the flower-enchained!<br/>Thou which wert once, and then didst cease to be,<br/>Now art, and henceforth ever shalt be, free,<br/>If Hope, and Truth, and Justice can avail,--<br/>Hail, hail, all hail!<br/><br/>STROPHE 2.<br/><br/>Thou youngest giant birth<br/>Which from the groaning earth<br/>Leap'st, clothed in armour of impenetrable scale!<br/>Last of the Intercessors!<br/>Who 'gainst the Crowned Transgressors<br/>Pleadest before God's love! Arrayed in Wisdom's mail,<br/>Wave thy lightning lance in mirth<br/>Nor let thy high heart fail,<br/>Though from their hundred gates the leagued Oppressors<br/>With hurried legions move!<br/>Hail, hail, all hail!<br/><br/>ANTISTROPHE 1a.<br/><br/>What though Cimmerian Anarchs dare blaspheme<br/>Freedom and thee? thy shield is as a mirror<br/>To make their blind slaves see, and with fierce gleam<br/>To turn his hungry sword upon the wearer;<br/>A new Actaeon's error<br/>Shall theirs have been--devoured by their own hounds!<br/>Be thou like the imperial Basilisk<br/>Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!<br/>Gaze on Oppression, till at that dread risk<br/>Aghast she pass from the Earth's disk:<br/>Fear not, but gaze--for freemen mightier grow,<br/>And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe:--<br/>If Hope, and Truth, and Justice may avail,<br/>Thou shalt be great--All hail!<br/><br/>ANTISTROPHE 2a.<br/><br/>From Freedom's form divine,<br/>From Nature's inmost shrine,<br/>Strip every impious gawd, rend<br/>Error veil by veil;<br/>O'er Ruin desolate,<br/>O'er Falsehood's fallen state,<br/>Sit thou sublime, unawed; be the Destroyer pale!<br/>And equal laws be thine,<br/>And winged words let sail,<br/>Freighted with truth even from the throne of God:<br/>That wealth, surviving fate,<br/>Be thine.--All hail!<br/><br/>ANTISTROPHE 1b.<br/><br/>Didst thou not start to hear Spain's thrilling paean<br/>From land to land re-echoed solemnly,<br/>Till silence became music? From the Aeaean<br/>To the cold Alps, eternal Italy<br/>Starts to hear thine! The Sea<br/>Which paves the desert streets of Venice laughs<br/>In light, and music; widowed Genoa wan<br/>By moonlight spells ancestral epitaphs,<br/>Murmuring, 'Where is Doria?' fair Milan,<br/>Within whose veins long ran<br/>The viper's palsying venom, lifts her heel<br/>To bruise his head. The signal and the seal<br/>(If Hope and Truth and Justice can avail)<br/>Art thou of all these hopes.--O hail!<br/><br/>ANTISTROPHE 2b.<br/><br/>Florence! beneath the sun,<br/>Of cities fairest one,<br/>Blushes within her bower for Freedom's expectation:<br/>From eyes of quenchless hope<br/>Rome tears the priestly cope,<br/>As ruling once by power, so now by admiration,--<br/>An athlete stripped to run<br/>From a remoter station<br/>For the high prize lost on Philippi's shore:--<br/>As then Hope, Truth, and Justice did avail,<br/>So now may Fraud and Wrong! O hail!<br/><br/>EPODE 1b.<br/><br/>Hear ye the march as of the Earth-born Forms<br/>Arrayed against the ever-living Gods?<br/>The crash and darkness of a thousand storms<br/>Bursting their inaccessible abodes<br/>Of crags and thunder-clouds?<br/>See ye the banners blazoned to the day,<br/>Inwrought with emblems of barbaric pride?<br/>Dissonant threats kill Silence far away,<br/>The serene Heaven which wraps our Eden wide<br/>With iron light is dyed;<br/>The Anarchs of the North lead forth their legions<br/>Like Chaos o'er creation, uncreating;<br/>An hundred tribes nourished on strange religions<br/>And lawless slaveries,--down the aereal regions<br/>Of the white Alps, desolating,<br/>Famished wolves that bide no waiting,<br/>Blotting the glowing footsteps of old glory,<br/>Trampling our columned cities into dust,<br/>Their dull and savage lust<br/>On Beauty's corse to sickness satiating--<br/>They come! The fields they tread look black and hoary<br/>With fire--from their red feet the streams run gory!<br/><br/>EPODE 2b.<br/><br/>Great Spirit, deepest Love!<br/>Which rulest and dost move<br/>All things which live and are, within the Italian shore;<br/>Who spreadest Heaven around it,<br/>Whose woods, rocks, waves, surround it;<br/>Who sittest in thy star, o'er Ocean's western floor;<br/>Spirit of beauty! at whose soft command<br/>The sunbeams and the showers distil its foison<br/>From the Earth's bosom chill;<br/>Oh, bid those beams be each a blinding brand<br/>Of lightning! bid those showers be dews of poison!<br/>Bid the Earth's plenty kill!<br/>Bid thy bright Heaven above,<br/>Whilst light and darkness bound it,<br/>Be their tomb who planned<br/>To make it ours and thine!<br/>Or, with thine harmonizing ardours fill<br/>And raise thy sons, as o'er the prone horizon<br/>Thy lamp feeds every twilight wave with fire--<br/>Be man's high hope and unextinct desire<br/>The instrument to work thy will divine!<br/>Then clouds from sunbeams, antelopes from leopards,<br/>And frowns and fears from thee,<br/>Would not more swiftly flee<br/>Than Celtic wolves from the Ausonian shepherds.--<br/>Whatever, Spirit, from thy starry shrine<br/>Thou yieldest or withholdest, oh, let be<br/>This city of thy worship ever free!
