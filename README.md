# üíÆ In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess, Queen ELIZABETH by *Anne Bradstreet*

<p>
    Proem.<br/><br/>1.1 Although great Queen, thou now in silence lie,<br/>1.2 Yet thy loud Herald Fame, doth to the sky<br/>1.3 Thy wondrous worth proclaim, in every clime,<br/>1.4 And so has vow'd, whilst there is world or time.<br/>1.5 So great's thy glory, and thine excellence,<br/>1.6 The sound thereof raps every human sense<br/>1.7 That men account it no impiety<br/>1.8 To say thou wert a fleshly Deity.<br/>1.9 Thousands bring off'rings (though out of date)<br/>1.10 Thy world of honours to accumulate.<br/>1.11 'Mongst hundred Hecatombs of roaring Verse,<br/>1.12 'Mine bleating stands before thy royal Hearse.<br/>1.13 Thou never didst, nor canst thou now disdain,<br/>1.14 T' accept the tribute of a loyal Brain.<br/>1.15 Thy clemency did yerst esteem as much<br/>1.16 The acclamations of the poor, as rich,<br/>1.17 Which makes me deem, my rudeness is no wrong,<br/>1.18 Though I resound thy greatness 'mongst the throng.<br/><br/>The Poem.<br/><br/>2.1 No Ph{oe}nix Pen, nor Spenser's Poetry,<br/>2.2 No Speed's, nor Camden's learned History;<br/>2.3 Eliza's works, wars, praise, can e're compact,<br/>2.4 The World's the Theater where she did act.<br/>2.5 No memories, nor volumes can contain,<br/>2.6 The nine Olymp'ades of her happy reign,<br/>2.7 Who was so good, so just, so learn'd, so wise,<br/>2.8 From all the Kings on earth she won the prize.<br/>2.9 Nor say I more than truly is her due.<br/>2.10 Millions will testify that this is true.<br/>2.11 She hath wip'd off th' aspersion of her Sex,<br/>2.12 That women wisdom lack to play the Rex.<br/>2.13 Spain's Monarch sa's not so, not yet his Host:<br/>2.14 She taught them better manners to their cost.<br/>2.15 The Salic Law had not in force now been,<br/>2.16 If France had ever hop'd for such a Queen.<br/>2.17 But can you Doctors now this point dispute,<br/>2.18 She's argument enough to make you mute,<br/>2.19 Since first the Sun did run, his ne'er runn'd race,<br/>2.20 And earth had twice a year, a new old face;<br/>2.21 Since time was time, and man unmanly man,<br/>2.22 Come shew me such a Ph{oe}nix if you can.<br/>2.23 Was ever people better rul'd than hers?<br/>2.24 Was ever Land more happy, freed from stirs?<br/>2.25 Did ever wealth in England so abound?<br/>2.26 Her Victories in foreign Coasts resound?<br/>2.27 Ships more invincible than Spain's, her foe<br/>2.28 She rack't, she sack'd, she sunk his Armadoe.<br/>2.29 Her stately Troops advanc'd to Lisbon's wall,<br/>2.30 Don Anthony in's right for to install.<br/>2.31 She frankly help'd Franks' (brave) distressed King,<br/>2.32 The States united now her fame do sing.<br/>2.33 She their Protectrix was, they well do know,<br/>2.34 Unto our dread Virago, what they owe.<br/>2.35 Her Nobles sacrific'd their noble blood,<br/>2.36 Nor men, nor coin she shap'd, to do them good.<br/>2.37 The rude untamed Irish she did quell,<br/>2.38 And Tiron bound, before her picture fell.<br/>2.39 Had ever Prince such Counsellors as she?<br/>2.40 Her self Minerva caus'd them so to be.<br/>2.41 Such Soldiers, and such Captains never seen,<br/>2.42 As were the subjects of our (Pallas) Queen:<br/>2.43 Her Sea-men through all straits the world did round,<br/>2.44 Terra incognit√¶ might know her sound.<br/>2.45 Her Drake came laded home with Spanish gold,<br/>2.46 Her Essex took Cadiz, their Herculean hold.<br/>2.47 But time would fail me, so my wit would too,<br/>2.48 To tell of half she did, or she could do.<br/>2.49 Semiramis to her is but obscure;<br/>2.50 More infamy than fame she did procure.<br/>2.51 She plac'd her glory but on Babel's walls,<br/>2.52 World's wonder for a time, but yet it falls.<br/>2.53 Fierce Tomris (Cirus' Heads-man, Sythians' Queen)<br/>2.54 Had put her Harness off, had she but seen<br/>2.55 Our Amazon i' th' Camp at Tilbury,<br/>2.56 (Judging all valour, and all Majesty)<br/>2.57 Within that Princess to have residence,<br/>2.58 And prostrate yielded to her Excellence.<br/>2.59 Dido first Foundress of proud Carthage walls<br/>2.60 (Who living consummates her Funerals),<br/>2.61 A great Eliza, but compar'd with ours,<br/>2.62 How vanisheth her glory, wealth, and powers.<br/>2.63 Proud profuse Cleopatra, whose wrong name,<br/>2.64 Instead of glory, prov'd her Country's shame:<br/>2.65 Of her what worth in Story's to be seen,<br/>2.66 But that she was a rich √Ügyptian Queen.<br/>2.67 Zenobia, potent Empress of the East,<br/>2.68 And of all these without compare the best<br/>2.69 (Whom none but great Aurelius could quell)<br/>2.70 Yet for our Queen is no fit parallel:<br/>2.71 She was a Ph{oe}nix Queen, so shall she be,<br/>2.72 Her ashes not reviv'd more Ph{oe}nix she.<br/>2.73 Her personal perfections, who would tell,<br/>2.74 Must dip his Pen i' th' Heliconian Well,<br/>2.75 Which I may not, my pride doth but aspire<br/>2.76 To read what others write and then admire.<br/>2.77 Now say, have women worth, or have they none?<br/>2.78 Or had they some, but with our Queen is't gone?<br/>2.79 Nay Masculines, you have thus tax'd us long,<br/>2.80 But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong.<br/>2.81 Let such as say our sex is void of reason<br/>2.82 Know 'tis a slander now, but once was treason.<br/>2.83 But happy England, which had such a Queen,<br/>2.84 O happy, happy, had those days still been,<br/>2.85 But happiness lies in a higher sphere.<br/>2.86 Then wonder not, Eliza moves not here.<br/>2.87 Full fraught with honour, riches, and with days,<br/>2.88 She set, she set, like Titan in his rays.<br/>2.89 No more shall rise or set such glorious Sun,<br/>2.90 Until the heaven's great revolution:<br/>2.91 If then new things, their old form must retain,<br/>2.92 Eliza shall rule Albian once again.<br/><br/>Her Epitaph.<br/><br/>3.1 Here sleeps T H E Queen, this is the royal bed<br/>3.2 O' th' Damask Rose, sprung from the white and red,<br/>3.3 Whose sweet perfume fills the all-filling air,<br/>3.4 This Rose is withered, once so lovely fair:<br/>3.5 On neither tree did grow such Rose before,<br/>3.6 The greater was our gain, our loss the more.<br/><br/>Another.<br/><br/>4.1 Here lies the pride of Queens, pattern of Kings:<br/>4.2 So blaze it fame, here's feathers for thy wings.<br/>4.3 Here lies the envy'd, yet unparallel'd Prince,<br/>4.4 Whose living virtues speak (though dead long since).<br/>4.5 If many worlds, as that fantastic framed,<br/>4.6 In every one, be her great glory famed
