# üíÆ Geraint And Enid by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    O purblind race of miserable men,<br/>How many among us at this very hour<br/>Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves,<br/>By taking true for false, or false for true;<br/>Here, through the feeble twilight of this world<br/>Groping, how many, until we pass and reach<br/>That other, where we see as we are seen!<br/><br/>So fared it with Geraint, who issuing forth<br/>That morning, when they both had got to horse,<br/>Perhaps because he loved her passionately,<br/>And felt that tempest brooding round his heart,<br/>Which, if he spoke at all, would break perforce<br/>Upon a head so dear in thunder, said:<br/>'Not at my side. I charge thee ride before,<br/>Ever a good way on before; and this<br/>I charge thee, on thy duty as a wife,<br/>Whatever happens, not to speak to me,<br/>No, not a word!' and Enid was aghast;<br/>And forth they rode, but scarce three paces on,<br/>When crying out, 'Effeminate as I am,<br/>I will not fight my way with gilded arms,<br/>All shall be iron;' he loosed a mighty purse,<br/>Hung at his belt, and hurled it toward the squire.<br/>So the last sight that Enid had of home<br/>Was all the marble threshold flashing, strown<br/>With gold and scattered coinage, and the squire<br/>Chafing his shoulder: then he cried again,<br/>'To the wilds!' and Enid leading down the tracks<br/>Through which he bad her lead him on, they past<br/>The marches, and by bandit-haunted holds,<br/>Gray swamps and pools, waste places of the hern,<br/>And wildernesses, perilous paths, they rode:<br/>Round was their pace at first, but slackened soon:<br/>A stranger meeting them had surely thought<br/>They rode so slowly and they looked so pale,<br/>That each had suffered some exceeding wrong.<br/>For he was ever saying to himself,<br/>'O I that wasted time to tend upon her,<br/>To compass her with sweet observances,<br/>To dress her beautifully and keep her true'--<br/>And there he broke the sentence in his heart<br/>Abruptly, as a man upon his tongue<br/>May break it, when his passion masters him.<br/>And she was ever praying the sweet heavens<br/>To save her dear lord whole from any wound.<br/>And ever in her mind she cast about<br/>For that unnoticed failing in herself,<br/>Which made him look so cloudy and so cold;<br/>Till the great plover's human whistle amazed<br/>Her heart, and glancing round the waste she feared<br/>In ever wavering brake an ambuscade.<br/>Then thought again, 'If there be such in me,<br/>I might amend it by the grace of Heaven,<br/>If he would only speak and tell me of it.'<br/><br/>But when the fourth part of the day was gone,<br/>Then Enid was aware of three tall knights<br/>On horseback, wholly armed, behind a rock<br/>In shadow, waiting for them, caitiffs all;<br/>And heard one crying to his fellow, 'Look,<br/>Here comes a laggard hanging down his head,<br/>Who seems no bolder than a beaten hound;<br/>Come, we will slay him and will have his horse<br/>And armour, and his damsel shall be ours.'<br/><br/>Then Enid pondered in her heart, and said:<br/>'I will go back a little to my lord,<br/>And I will tell him all their caitiff talk;<br/>For, be he wroth even to slaying me,<br/>Far liefer by his dear hand had I die,<br/>Than that my lord should suffer loss or shame.'<br/><br/>Then she went back some paces of return,<br/>Met his full frown timidly firm, and said;<br/>'My lord, I saw three bandits by the rock<br/>Waiting to fall on you, and heard them boast<br/>That they would slay you, and possess your horse<br/>And armour, and your damsel should be theirs.'<br/><br/>He made a wrathful answer: 'Did I wish<br/>Your warning or your silence? one command<br/>I laid upon you, not to speak to me,<br/>And thus ye keep it! Well then, look--for now,<br/>Whether ye wish me victory or defeat,<br/>Long for my life, or hunger for my death,<br/>Yourself shall see my vigour is not lost.'<br/><br/>Then Enid waited pale and sorrowful,<br/>And down upon him bare the bandit three.<br/>And at the midmost charging, Prince Geraint<br/>Drave the long spear a cubit through his breast<br/>And out beyond; and then against his brace<br/>Of comrades, each of whom had broken on him<br/>A lance that splintered like an icicle,<br/>Swung from his brand a windy buffet out<br/>Once, twice, to right, to left, and stunned the twain<br/>Or slew them, and dismounting like a man<br/>That skins the wild beast after slaying him,<br/>Stript from the three dead wolves of woman born<br/>The three gay suits of armour which they wore,<br/>And let the bodies lie, but bound the suits<br/>Of armour on their horses, each on each,<br/>And tied the bridle-reins of all the three<br/>Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on<br/>Before you;' and she drove them through the waste.<br/><br/>He followed nearer; ruth began to work<br/>Against his anger in him, while he watched<br/>The being he loved best in all the world,<br/>With difficulty in mild obedience<br/>Driving them on: he fain had spoken to her,<br/>And loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath<br/>And smouldered wrong that burnt him all within;<br/>But evermore it seemed an easier thing<br/>At once without remorse to strike her dead,<br/>Than to cry 'Halt,' and to her own bright face<br/>Accuse her of the least immodesty:<br/>And thus tongue-tied, it made him wroth the more<br/>That she COULD speak whom his own ear had heard<br/>Call herself false: and suffering thus he made<br/>Minutes an age: but in scarce longer time<br/>Than at Caerleon the full-tided Usk,<br/>Before he turn to fall seaward again,<br/>Pauses, did Enid, keeping watch, behold<br/>In the first shallow shade of a deep wood,<br/>Before a gloom of stubborn-shafted oaks,<br/>Three other horsemen waiting, wholly armed,<br/>Whereof one seemed far larger than her lord,<br/>And shook her pulses, crying, 'Look, a prize!<br/>Three horses and three goodly suits of arms,<br/>And all in charge of whom? a girl: set on.'<br/>'Nay,' said the second, 'yonder comes a knight.'<br/>The third, 'A craven; how he hangs his head.'<br/>The giant answered merrily, 'Yea, but one?<br/>Wait here, and when he passes fall upon him.'<br/><br/>And Enid pondered in her heart and said,<br/>'I will abide the coming of my lord,<br/>And I will tell him all their villainy.<br/>My lord is weary with the fight before,<br/>And they will fall upon him unawares.<br/>I needs must disobey him for his good;<br/>How should I dare obey him to his harm?<br/>Needs must I speak, and though he kill me for it,<br/>I save a life dearer to me than mine.'<br/><br/>And she abode his coming, and said to him<br/>With timid firmness, 'Have I leave to speak?'<br/>He said, 'Ye take it, speaking,' and she spoke.<br/><br/>'There lurk three villains yonder in the wood,<br/>And each of them is wholly armed, and one<br/>Is larger-limbed than you are, and they say<br/>That they will fall upon you while ye pass.'<br/><br/>To which he flung a wrathful answer back:<br/>'And if there were an hundred in the wood,<br/>And every man were larger-limbed than I,<br/>And all at once should sally out upon me,<br/>I swear it would not ruffle me so much<br/>As you that not obey me. Stand aside,<br/>And if I fall, cleave to the better man.'<br/><br/>And Enid stood aside to wait the event,<br/>Not dare to watch the combat, only breathe<br/>Short fits of prayer, at every stroke a breath.<br/>And he, she dreaded most, bare down upon him.<br/>Aimed at the helm, his lance erred; but Geraint's,<br/>A little in the late encounter strained,<br/>Struck through the bulky bandit's corselet home,<br/>And then brake short, and down his enemy rolled,<br/>And there lay still; as he that tells the tale<br/>Saw once a great piece of a promontory,<br/>That had a sapling growing on it, slide<br/>From the long shore-cliff's windy walls to the beach,<br/>And there lie still, and yet the sapling grew:<br/>So lay the man transfixt. His craven pair<br/>Of comrades making slowlier at the Prince,<br/>When now they saw their bulwark fallen, stood;<br/>On whom the victor, to confound them more,<br/>Spurred with his terrible war-cry; for as one,<br/>That listens near a torrent mountain-brook,<br/>All through the crash of the near cataract hears<br/>The drumming thunder of the huger fall<br/>At distance, were the soldiers wont to hear<br/>His voice in battle, and be kindled by it,<br/>And foemen scared, like that false pair who turned<br/>Flying, but, overtaken, died the death<br/>Themselves had wrought on many an innocent.<br/><br/>Thereon Geraint, dismounting, picked the lance<br/>That pleased him best, and drew from those dead wolves<br/>Their three gay suits of armour, each from each,<br/>And bound them on their horses, each on each,<br/>And tied the bridle-reins of all the three<br/>Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on<br/>Before you,' and she drove them through the wood.<br/><br/>He followed nearer still: the pain she had<br/>To keep them in the wild ways of the wood,<br/>Two sets of three laden with jingling arms,<br/>Together, served a little to disedge<br/>The sharpness of that pain about her heart:<br/>And they themselves, like creatures gently born<br/>But into bad hands fallen, and now so long<br/>By bandits groomed, pricked their light ears, and felt<br/>Her low firm voice and tender government.<br/><br/>So through the green gloom of the wood they past,<br/>And issuing under open heavens beheld<br/>A little town with towers, upon a rock,<br/>And close beneath, a meadow gemlike chased<br/>In the brown wild, and mowers mowing in it:<br/>And down a rocky pathway from the place<br/>There came a fair-haired youth, that in his hand<br/>Bare victual for the mowers: and Geraint<br/>Had ruth again on Enid looking pale:<br/>Then, moving downward to the meadow ground,<br/>He, when the fair-haired youth came by him, said,<br/>'Friend, let her eat; the damsel is so faint.'<br/>'Yea, willingly,' replied the youth; 'and thou,<br/>My lord, eat also, though the fare is coarse,<br/>And only meet for mowers;' then set down<br/>His basket, and dismounting on the sward<br/>They let the horses graze, and ate themselves.<br/>And Enid took a little delicately,<br/>Less having stomach for it than desire<br/>To close with her lord's pleasure; but Geraint<br/>Ate all the mowers' victual unawares,<br/>And when he found all empty, was amazed;<br/>And 'Boy,' said he, 'I have eaten all, but take<br/>A horse and arms for guerdon; choose the best.'<br/>He, reddening in extremity of delight,<br/>'My lord, you overpay me fifty-fold.'<br/>'Ye will be all the wealthier,' cried the Prince.<br/>'I take it as free gift, then,' said the boy,<br/>'Not guerdon; for myself can easily,<br/>While your good damsel rests, return, and fetch<br/>Fresh victual for these mowers of our Earl;<br/>For these are his, and all the field is his,<br/>And I myself am his; and I will tell him<br/>How great a man thou art: he loves to know<br/>When men of mark are in his territory:<br/>And he will have thee to his palace here,<br/>And serve thee costlier than with mowers' fare.'<br/><br/>Then said Geraint, 'I wish no better fare:<br/>I never ate with angrier appetite<br/>Than when I left your mowers dinnerless.<br/>And into no Earl's palace will I go.<br/>I know, God knows, too much of palaces!<br/>And if he want me, let him come to me.<br/>But hire us some fair chamber for the night,<br/>And stalling for the horses, and return<br/>With victual for these men, and let us know.'<br/><br/>'Yea, my kind lord,' said the glad youth, and went,<br/>Held his head high, and thought himself a knight,<br/>And up the rocky pathway disappeared,<br/>Leading the horse, and they were left alone.<br/><br/>But when the Prince had brought his errant eyes<br/>Home from the rock, sideways he let them glance<br/>At Enid, where she droopt: his own false doom,<br/>That shadow of mistrust should never cross<br/>Betwixt them, came upon him, and he sighed;<br/>Then with another humorous ruth remarked<br/>The lusty mowers labouring dinnerless,<br/>And watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe,<br/>And after nodded sleepily in the heat.<br/>But she, remembering her old ruined hall,<br/>And all the windy clamour of the daws<br/>About her hollow turret, plucked the grass<br/>There growing longest by the meadow's edge,<br/>And into many a listless annulet,<br/>Now over, now beneath her marriage ring,<br/>Wove and unwove it, till the boy returned<br/>And told them of a chamber, and they went;<br/>Where, after saying to her, 'If ye will,<br/>Call for the woman of the house,' to which<br/>She answered, 'Thanks, my lord;' the two remained<br/>Apart by all the chamber's width, and mute<br/>As two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth,<br/>Or two wild men supporters of a shield,<br/>Painted, who stare at open space, nor glance<br/>The one at other, parted by the shield.<br/><br/>On a sudden, many a voice along the street,<br/>And heel against the pavement echoing, burst<br/>Their drowse; and either started while the door,<br/>Pushed from without, drave backward to the wall,<br/>And midmost of a rout of roisterers,<br/>Femininely fair and dissolutely pale,<br/>Her suitor in old years before Geraint,<br/>Entered, the wild lord of the place, Limours.<br/>He moving up with pliant courtliness,<br/>Greeted Geraint full face, but stealthily,<br/>In the mid-warmth of welcome and graspt hand,<br/>Found Enid with the corner of his eye,<br/>And knew her sitting sad and solitary.<br/>Then cried Geraint for wine and goodly cheer<br/>To feed the sudden guest, and sumptuously<br/>According to his fashion, bad the host<br/>Call in what men soever were his friends,<br/>And feast with these in honour of their Earl;<br/>'And care not for the cost; the cost is mine.'<br/><br/>And wine and food were brought, and Earl Limours<br/>Drank till he jested with all ease, and told<br/>Free tales, and took the word and played upon it,<br/>And made it of two colours; for his talk,<br/>When wine and free companions kindled him,<br/>Was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem<br/>Of fifty facets; thus he moved the Prince<br/>To laughter and his comrades to applause.<br/>Then, when the Prince was merry, asked Limours,<br/>'Your leave, my lord, to cross the room, and speak<br/>To your good damsel there who sits apart,<br/>And seems so lonely?' 'My free leave,' he said;<br/>'Get her to speak: she doth not speak to me.'<br/>Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,<br/>Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,<br/>Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,<br/>Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:<br/><br/>'Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,<br/>Enid, my early and my only love,<br/>Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild--<br/>What chance is this? how is it I see you here?<br/>Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.<br/>Yet fear me not: I call mine own self wild,<br/>But keep a touch of sweet civility<br/>Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.<br/>I thought, but that your father came between,<br/>In former days you saw me favourably.<br/>And if it were so do not keep it back:<br/>Make me a little happier: let me know it:<br/>Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?<br/>Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.<br/>And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,<br/>Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,<br/>You come with no attendance, page or maid,<br/>To serve you--doth he love you as of old?<br/>For, call it lovers' quarrels, yet I know<br/>Though men may bicker with the things they love,<br/>They would not make them laughable in all eyes,<br/>Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,<br/>A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks<br/>Your story, that this man loves you no more.<br/>Your beauty is no beauty to him now:<br/>A common chance--right well I know it--palled--<br/>For I know men: nor will ye win him back,<br/>For the man's love once gone never returns.<br/>But here is one who loves you as of old;<br/>With more exceeding passion than of old:<br/>Good, speak the word: my followers ring him round:<br/>He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;<br/>They understand: nay; I do not mean blood:<br/>Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:<br/>My malice is no deeper than a moat,<br/>No stronger than a wall: there is the keep;<br/>He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:<br/>Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me<br/>The one true lover whom you ever owned,<br/>I will make use of all the power I have.<br/>O pardon me! the madness of that hour,<br/>When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.'<br/><br/>At this the tender sound of his own voice<br/>And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,<br/>Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,<br/>Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;<br/>And answered with such craft as women use,<br/>Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance<br/>That breaks upon them perilously, and said:<br/><br/>'Earl, if you love me as in former years,<br/>And do not practise on me, come with morn,<br/>And snatch me from him as by violence;<br/>Leave me tonight: I am weary to the death.'<br/><br/>Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume<br/>Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,<br/>And the stout Prince bad him a loud good-night.<br/>He moving homeward babbled to his men,<br/>How Enid never loved a man but him,<br/>Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.<br/><br/>But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,<br/>Debating his command of silence given,<br/>And that she now perforce must violate it,<br/>Held commune with herself, and while she held<br/>He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart<br/>To wake him, but hung o'er him, wholly pleased<br/>To find him yet unwounded after fight,<br/>And hear him breathing low and equally.<br/>Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped<br/>The pieces of his armour in one place,<br/>All to be there against a sudden need;<br/>Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled<br/>By that day's grief and travel, evermore<br/>Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then<br/>Went slipping down horrible precipices,<br/>And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;<br/>Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,<br/>With all his rout of random followers,<br/>Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;<br/>Which was the red cock shouting to the light,<br/>As the gray dawn stole o'er the dewy world,<br/>And glimmered on his armour in the room.<br/>And once again she rose to look at it,<br/>But touched it unawares: jangling, the casque<br/>Fell, and he started up and stared at her.<br/>Then breaking his command of silence given,<br/>She told him all that Earl Limours had said,<br/>Except the passage that he loved her not;<br/>Nor left untold the craft herself had used;<br/>But ended with apology so sweet,<br/>Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed<br/>So justified by that necessity,<br/>That though he thought 'was it for him she wept<br/>In Devon?' he but gave a wrathful groan,<br/>Saying, 'Your sweet faces make good fellows fools<br/>And traitors. Call the host and bid him bring<br/>Charger and palfrey.' So she glided out<br/>Among the heavy breathings of the house,<br/>And like a household Spirit at the walls<br/>Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:<br/>Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,<br/>In silence, did him service as a squire;<br/>Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,<br/>'Thy reckoning, friend?' and ere he learnt it, 'Take<br/>Five horses and their armours;' and the host<br/>Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,<br/>'My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!'<br/>'Ye will be all the wealthier,' said the Prince,<br/>And then to Enid, 'Forward! and today<br/>I charge you, Enid, more especially,<br/>What thing soever ye may hear, or see,<br/>Or fancy (though I count it of small use<br/>To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.'<br/><br/>And Enid answered, 'Yea, my lord, I know<br/>Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,<br/>I hear the violent threats you do not hear,<br/>I see the danger which you cannot see:<br/>Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;<br/>Almost beyond me: yet I would obey.'<br/><br/>'Yea so,' said he, 'do it: be not too wise;<br/>Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,<br/>Not all mismated with a yawning clown,<br/>But one with arms to guard his head and yours,<br/>With eyes to find you out however far,<br/>And ears to hear you even in his dreams.'<br/><br/>With that he turned and looked as keenly at her<br/>As careful robins eye the delver's toil;<br/>And that within her, which a wanton fool,<br/>Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,<br/>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.<br/>And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.<br/><br/>Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,<br/>Led from the territory of false Limours<br/>To the waste earldom of another earl,<br/>Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,<br/>Went Enid with her sullen follower on.<br/>Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride<br/>More near by many a rood than yestermorn,<br/>It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint<br/>Waving an angry hand as who should say<br/>'Ye watch me,' saddened all her heart again.<br/>But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,<br/>The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof<br/>Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw<br/>Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.<br/>Then not to disobey her lord's behest,<br/>And yet to give him warning, for he rode<br/>As if he heard not, moving back she held<br/>Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.<br/>At which the warrior in his obstinacy,<br/>Because she kept the letter of his word,<br/>Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.<br/>And in the moment after, wild Limours,<br/>Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud<br/>Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,<br/>Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,<br/>And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,<br/>Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore<br/>Down by the length of lance and arm beyond<br/>The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,<br/>And overthrew the next that followed him,<br/>And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.<br/>But at the flash and motion of the man<br/>They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal<br/>Of darting fish, that on a summer morn<br/>Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot<br/>Come slipping o'er their shadows on the sand,<br/>But if a man who stands upon the brink<br/>But lift a shining hand against the sun,<br/>There is not left the twinkle of a fin<br/>Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;<br/>So, scared but at the motion of the man,<br/>Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,<br/>And left him lying in the public way;<br/>So vanish friendships only made in wine.<br/><br/>Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,<br/>Who saw the chargers of the two that fell<br/>Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,<br/>Mixt with the flyers. 'Horse and man,' he said,<br/>'All of one mind and all right-honest friends!<br/>Not a hoof left: and I methinks till now<br/>Was honest--paid with horses and with arms;<br/>I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:<br/>And so what say ye, shall we strip him there<br/>Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough<br/>To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?<br/>No?--then do thou, being right honest, pray<br/>That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,<br/>I too would still be honest.' Thus he said:<br/>And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,<br/>And answering not one word, she led the way.<br/><br/>But as a man to whom a dreadful loss<br/>Falls in a far land and he knows it not,<br/>But coming back he learns it, and the loss<br/>So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;<br/>So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked<br/>In combat with the follower of Limours,<br/>Bled underneath his armour secretly,<br/>And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife<br/>What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,<br/>Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;<br/>And at a sudden swerving of the road,<br/>Though happily down on a bank of grass,<br/>The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.<br/><br/>And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,<br/>Suddenly came, and at his side all pale<br/>Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,<br/>Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye<br/>Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,<br/>And tearing off her veil of faded silk<br/>Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,<br/>And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord's life.<br/>Then after all was done that hand could do,<br/>She rested, and her desolation came<br/>Upon her, and she wept beside the way.<br/><br/>And many past, but none regarded her,<br/>For in that realm of lawless turbulence,<br/>A woman weeping for her murdered mate<br/>Was cared as much for as a summer shower:<br/>One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,<br/>Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:<br/>Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,<br/>Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;<br/>Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,<br/>He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:<br/>Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm<br/>Before an ever-fancied arrow, made<br/>The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;<br/>At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,<br/>And scoured into the coppices and was lost,<br/>While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.<br/><br/>But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,<br/>Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,<br/>Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,<br/>Came riding with a hundred lances up;<br/>But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,<br/>Cried out with a big voice, 'What, is he dead?'<br/>'No, no, not dead!' she answered in all haste.<br/>'Would some of your people take him up,<br/>And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?<br/>Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.'<br/><br/>Then said Earl Doorm: 'Well, if he be not dead,<br/>Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.<br/>And be he dead, I count you for a fool;<br/>Your wailing will not quicken him: dead or not,<br/>Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.<br/>Yet, since the face IS comely--some of you,<br/>Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:<br/>An if he live, we will have him of our band;<br/>And if he die, why earth has earth enough<br/>To hide him. See ye take the charger too,<br/>A noble one.'<br/>He spake, and past away,<br/>But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,<br/>Each growling like a dog, when his good bone<br/>Seems to be plucked at by the village boys<br/>Who love to vex him eating, and he fears<br/>To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,<br/>Gnawing and growling: so the ruffians growled,<br/>Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,<br/>Their chance of booty from the morning's raid,<br/>Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,<br/>Such as they brought upon their forays out<br/>For those that might be wounded; laid him on it<br/>All in the hollow of his shield, and took<br/>And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,<br/>(His gentle charger following him unled)<br/>And cast him and the bier in which he lay<br/>Down on an oaken settle in the hall,<br/>And then departed, hot in haste to join<br/>Their luckier mates, but growling as before,<br/>And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,<br/>And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.<br/>They might as well have blest her: she was deaf<br/>To blessing or to cursing save from one.<br/><br/>So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,<br/>There in the naked hall, propping his head,<br/>And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.<br/>Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,<br/>And found his own dear bride propping his head,<br/>And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;<br/>And felt the warm tears falling on his face;<br/>And said to his own heart, 'She weeps for me:'<br/>And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,<br/>That he might prove her to the uttermost,<br/>And say to his own heart, 'She weeps for me.'<br/><br/>But in the falling afternoon returned<br/>The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.<br/>His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:<br/>Each hurling down a heap of things that rang<br/>Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,<br/>And doffed his helm: and then there fluttered in,<br/>Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,<br/>A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,<br/>And mingled with the spearmen: and Earl Doorm<br/>Struck with a knife's haft hard against the board,<br/>And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.<br/>And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,<br/>And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:<br/>And none spake word, but all sat down at once,<br/>And ate with tumult in the naked hall,<br/>Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;<br/>Till Enid shrank far back into herself,<br/>To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.<br/>But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,<br/>He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found<br/>A damsel drooping in a corner of it.<br/>Then he remembered her, and how she wept;<br/>And out of her there came a power upon him;<br/>And rising on the sudden he said, 'Eat!<br/>I never yet beheld a thing so pale.<br/>God's curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.<br/>Eat! Look yourself. Good luck had your good man,<br/>For were I dead who is it would weep for me?<br/>Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath<br/>Have I beheld a lily like yourself.<br/>And so there lived some colour in your cheek,<br/>There is not one among my gentlewomen<br/>Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.<br/>But listen to me, and by me be ruled,<br/>And I will do the thing I have not done,<br/>For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,<br/>And we will live like two birds in one nest,<br/>And I will fetch you forage from all fields,<br/>For I compel all creatures to my will.'<br/><br/>He spoke: the brawny spearman let his cheek<br/>Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;<br/>While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn<br/>Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf<br/>And makes it earth, hissed each at other's ear<br/>What shall not be recorded--women they,<br/>Women, or what had been those gracious things,<br/>But now desired the humbling of their best,<br/>Yea, would have helped him to it: and all at once<br/>They hated her, who took no thought of them,<br/>But answered in low voice, her meek head yet<br/>Drooping, 'I pray you of your courtesy,<br/>He being as he is, to let me be.'<br/><br/>She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,<br/>But like a mighty patron, satisfied<br/>With what himself had done so graciously,<br/>Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, 'Yea,<br/>Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.'<br/><br/>She answered meekly, 'How should I be glad<br/>Henceforth in all the world at anything,<br/>Until my lord arise and look upon me?'<br/><br/>Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,<br/>As all but empty heart and weariness<br/>And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,<br/>And bare her by main violence to the board,<br/>And thrust the dish before her, crying, 'Eat.'<br/><br/>'No, no,' said Enid, vext, 'I will not eat<br/>Till yonder man upon the bier arise,<br/>And eat with me.' 'Drink, then,' he answered. 'Here!'<br/>(And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)<br/>'Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,<br/>God's curse, with anger--often I myself,<br/>Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:<br/>Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.'<br/><br/>'Not so,' she cried, 'by Heaven, I will not drink<br/>Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,<br/>And drink with me; and if he rise no more,<br/>I will not look at wine until I die.'<br/><br/>At this he turned all red and paced his hall,<br/>Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,<br/>And coming up close to her, said at last:<br/>'Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,<br/>Take warning: yonder man is surely dead;<br/>And I compel all creatures to my will.<br/>Not eat nor drink? And wherefore wail for one,<br/>Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn<br/>By dressing it in rags? Amazed am I,<br/>Beholding how ye butt against my wish,<br/>That I forbear you thus: cross me no more.<br/>At least put off to please me this poor gown,<br/>This silken rag, this beggar-woman's weed:<br/>I love that beauty should go beautifully:<br/>For see ye not my gentlewomen here,<br/>How gay, how suited to the house of one<br/>Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?<br/>Rise therefore; robe yourself in this: obey.'<br/><br/>He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen<br/>Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,<br/>Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue<br/>Played into green, and thicker down the front<br/>With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,<br/>When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,<br/>And with the dawn ascending lets the day<br/>Strike where it clung: so thickly shone the gems.<br/><br/>But Enid answered, harder to be moved<br/>Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,<br/>With life-long injuries burning unavenged,<br/>And now their hour has come; and Enid said:<br/><br/>'In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,<br/>And loved me serving in my father's hall:<br/>In this poor gown I rode with him to court,<br/>And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:<br/>In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,<br/>When now we rode upon this fatal quest<br/>Of honour, where no honour can be gained:<br/>And this poor gown I will not cast aside<br/>Until himself arise a living man,<br/>And bid me cast it. I have griefs enough:<br/>Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:<br/>I never loved, can never love but him:<br/>Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,<br/>He being as he is, to let me be.'<br/><br/>Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,<br/>And took his russet beard between his teeth;<br/>Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood<br/>Crying, 'I count it of no more avail,<br/>Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;<br/>Take my salute,' unknightly with flat hand,<br/>However lightly, smote her on the cheek.<br/><br/>Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,<br/>And since she thought, 'He had not dared to do it,<br/>Except he surely knew my lord was dead,'<br/>Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,<br/>As of a wild thing taken in the trap,<br/>Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.<br/><br/>This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,<br/>(It lay beside him in the hollow shield),<br/>Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it<br/>Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball<br/>The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.<br/>So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.<br/>And all the men and women in the hall<br/>Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled<br/>Yelling as from a spectre, and the two<br/>Were left alone together, and he said:<br/><br/>'Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;<br/>Done you more wrong: we both have undergone<br/>That trouble which has left me thrice your own:<br/>Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.<br/>And here I lay this penance on myself,<br/>Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn--<br/>You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,<br/>I heard you say, that you were no true wife:<br/>I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:<br/>I do believe yourself against yourself,<br/>And will henceforward rather die than doubt.'<br/><br/>And Enid could not say one tender word,<br/>She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:<br/>She only prayed him, 'Fly, they will return<br/>And slay you; fly, your charger is without,<br/>My palfrey lost.' 'Then, Enid, shall you ride<br/>Behind me.' 'Yea,' said Enid, 'let us go.'<br/>And moving out they found the stately horse,<br/>Who now no more a vassal to the thief,<br/>But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,<br/>Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped<br/>With a low whinny toward the pair: and she<br/>Kissed the white star upon his noble front,<br/>Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse<br/>Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot<br/>She set her own and climbed; he turned his face<br/>And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms<br/>About him, and at once they rode away.<br/><br/>And never yet, since high in Paradise<br/>O'er the four rivers the first roses blew,<br/>Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind<br/>Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour<br/>Put hand to hand beneath her husband's heart,<br/>And felt him hers again: she did not weep,<br/>But o'er her meek eyes came a happy mist<br/>Like that which kept the heart of Eden green<br/>Before the useful trouble of the rain:<br/>Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes<br/>As not to see before them on the path,<br/>Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,<br/>A knight of Arthur's court, who laid his lance<br/>In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.<br/>Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,<br/>She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,<br/>Shrieked to the stranger 'Slay not a dead man!'<br/>'The voice of Enid,' said the knight; but she,<br/>Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,<br/>Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,<br/>'O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.'<br/>And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:<br/>'My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;<br/>I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;<br/>And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,<br/>Who love you, Prince, with something of the love<br/>Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.<br/>For once, when I was up so high in pride<br/>That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,<br/>By overthrowing me you threw me higher.<br/>Now, made a knight of Arthur's Table Round,<br/>And since I knew this Earl, when I myself<br/>Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,<br/>I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm<br/>(The King is close behind me) bidding him<br/>Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,<br/>Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.'<br/><br/>'He hears the judgment of the King of kings,'<br/>Cried the wan Prince; 'and lo, the powers of Doorm<br/>Are scattered,' and he pointed to the field,<br/>Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,<br/>Were men and women staring and aghast,<br/>While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told<br/>How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.<br/>But when the knight besought him, 'Follow me,<br/>Prince, to the camp, and in the King's own ear<br/>Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured<br/>Strange chances here alone;' that other flushed,<br/>And hung his head, and halted in reply,<br/>Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,<br/>And after madness acted question asked:<br/>Till Edyrn crying, 'If ye will not go<br/>To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,'<br/>'Enough,' he said, 'I follow,' and they went.<br/>But Enid in their going had two fears,<br/>One from the bandit scattered in the field,<br/>And one from Edyrn. Every now and then,<br/>When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,<br/>She shrank a little. In a hollow land,<br/>From which old fires have broken, men may fear<br/>Fresh fire and ruin. He, perceiving, said:<br/><br/>'Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause<br/>To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.<br/>Yourself were first the blameless cause to make<br/>My nature's prideful sparkle in the blood<br/>Break into furious flame; being repulsed<br/>By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought<br/>Until I overturned him; then set up<br/>(With one main purpose ever at my heart)<br/>My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;<br/>Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,<br/>And, toppling over all antagonism,<br/>So waxed in pride, that I believed myself<br/>Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:<br/>And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,<br/>I should have slain your father, seized yourself.<br/>I lived in hope that sometime you would come<br/>To these my lists with him whom best you loved;<br/>And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes<br/>The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,<br/>Behold me overturn and trample on him.<br/>Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,<br/>I should not less have killed him. And so you came,--<br/>But once you came,--and with your own true eyes<br/>Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one<br/>Speaks of a service done him) overthrow<br/>My proud self, and my purpose three years old,<br/>And set his foot upon me, and give me life.<br/>There was I broken down; there was I saved:<br/>Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life<br/>He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.<br/>And all the penance the Queen laid upon me<br/>Was but to rest awhile within her court;<br/>Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,<br/>And waiting to be treated like a wolf,<br/>Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,<br/>Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,<br/>Such fine reserve and noble reticence,<br/>Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace<br/>Of tenderest courtesy, that I began<br/>To glance behind me at my former life,<br/>And find that it had been the wolf's indeed:<br/>And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,<br/>Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,<br/>Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,<br/>Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.<br/>And you were often there about the Queen,<br/>But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;<br/>Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,<br/>But kept myself aloof till I was changed;<br/>And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.'<br/><br/>He spoke, and Enid easily believed,<br/>Like simple noble natures, credulous<br/>Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,<br/>There most in those who most have done them ill.<br/>And when they reached the camp the King himself<br/>Advanced to greet them, and beholding her<br/>Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,<br/>But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held<br/>In converse for a little, and returned,<br/>And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,<br/>And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,<br/>And showed an empty tent allotted her,<br/>And glancing for a minute, till he saw her<br/>Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:<br/><br/>'Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave<br/>To move to your own land, and there defend<br/>Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,<br/>As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,<br/>By having looked too much through alien eyes,<br/>And wrought too long with delegated hands,<br/>Not used mine own: but now behold me come<br/>To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,<br/>With Edyrn and with others: have ye looked<br/>At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?<br/>This work of his is great and wonderful.<br/>His very face with change of heart is changed.<br/>The world will not believe a man repents:<br/>And this wise world of ours is mainly right.<br/>Full seldom doth a man repent, or use<br/>Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch<br/>Of blood and custom wholly out of him,<br/>And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.<br/>Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart<br/>As I will weed this land before I go.<br/>I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,<br/>Not rashly, but have proved him everyway<br/>One of our noblest, our most valorous,<br/>Sanest and most obedient: and indeed<br/>This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself<br/>After a life of violence, seems to me<br/>A thousand-fold more great and wonderful<br/>Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,<br/>My subject with my subjects under him,<br/>Should make an onslaught single on a realm<br/>Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,<br/>And were himself nigh wounded to the death.'<br/><br/>So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt<br/>His work was neither great nor wonderful,<br/>And past to Enid's tent; and thither came<br/>The King's own leech to look into his hurt;<br/>And Enid tended on him there; and there<br/>Her constant motion round him, and the breath<br/>Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,<br/>Filled all the genial courses of his blood<br/>With deeper and with ever deeper love,<br/>As the south-west that blowing Bala lake<br/>Fills all the sacred Dee. So past the days.<br/><br/>But while Geraint lay healing of his hurt,<br/>The blameless King went forth and cast his eyes<br/>On each of all whom Uther left in charge<br/>Long since, to guard the justice of the King:<br/>He looked and found them wanting; and as now<br/>Men weed the white horse on the Berkshire hills<br/>To keep him bright and clean as heretofore,<br/>He rooted out the slothful officer<br/>Or guilty, which for bribe had winked at wrong,<br/>And in their chairs set up a stronger race<br/>With hearts and hands, and sent a thousand men<br/>To till the wastes, and moving everywhere<br/>Cleared the dark places and let in the law,<br/>And broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land.<br/><br/>Then, when Geraint was whole again, they past<br/>With Arthur to Caerleon upon Usk.<br/>There the great Queen once more embraced her friend,<br/>And clothed her in apparel like the day.<br/>And though Geraint could never take again<br/>That comfort from their converse which he took<br/>Before the Queen's fair name was breathed upon,<br/>He rested well content that all was well.<br/>Thence after tarrying for a space they rode,<br/>And fifty knights rode with them to the shores<br/>Of Severn, and they past to their own land.<br/>And there he kept the justice of the King<br/>So vigorously yet mildly, that all hearts<br/>Applauded, and the spiteful whisper died:<br/>And being ever foremost in the chase,<br/>And victor at the tilt and tournament,<br/>They called him the great Prince and man of men.<br/>But Enid, whom her ladies loved to call<br/>Enid the Fair, a grateful people named<br/>Enid the Good; and in their halls arose<br/>The cry of children, Enids and Geraints<br/>Of times to be; nor did he doubt her more,<br/>But rested in her falty, till he crowned<br/>A happy life with a fair death, and fell<br/>Against the heathen of the Northern Sea<br/>In battle, fighting for the blameless King.
