# üíÆ Morituri Salutamus: Poem for the Fiftieth Anniversary by *Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*

<p>
    Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis,<br/>Et fugiunt freno non remorante dies.<br/>Ovid, Fastorum, Lib. vi.<br/>"O C–∂sar, we who are about to die<br/>Salute you!" was the gladiators' cry<br/>In the arena, standing face to face<br/>With death and with the Roman populace.<br/>O ye familiar scenes,--ye groves of pine,<br/>That once were mine and are no longer mine,--<br/>Thou river, widening through the meadows green<br/>To the vast sea, so near and yet unseen,--<br/>Ye halls, in whose seclusion and repose<br/><br/>Phantoms of fame, like exhalations, rose<br/>And vanished,--we who are about to die,<br/>Salute you; earth and air and sea and sky,<br/>And the Imperial Sun that scatters down<br/>His sovereign splendors upon grove and town.<br/><br/>Ye do not answer us! ye do not hear!<br/>We are forgotten; and in your austere<br/>And calm indifference, ye little care<br/>Whether we come or go, or whence or where.<br/>What passing generations fill these halls,<br/>What passing voices echo from these walls,<br/>Ye heed not; we are only as the blast,<br/>A moment heard, and then forever past.<br/><br/>Not so the teachers who in earlier days<br/>Led our bewildered feet through learning's maze;<br/>They answer us--alas! what have I said?<br/>What greetings come there from the voiceless dead?<br/>What salutation, welcome, or reply?<br/>What pressure from the hands that lifeless lie?<br/>They are no longer here; they all are gone<br/>Into the land of shadows,--all save one.<br/>Honor and reverence, and the good repute<br/>That follows faithful service as its fruit,<br/>Be unto him, whom living we salute.<br/><br/>The great Italian poet, when he made<br/>His dreadful journey to the realms of shade,<br/>Met there the old instructor of his youth,<br/>And cried in tones of pity and of ruth:<br/>"Oh, never from the memory of my heart<br/><br/>Your dear, paternal image shall depart,<br/>Who while on earth, ere yet by death surprised,<br/>Taught me how mortals are immortalized;<br/>How grateful am I for that patient care<br/>All my life long my language shall declare."<br/><br/>To-day we make the poet's words our own,<br/>And utter them in plaintive undertone;<br/>Nor to the living only be they said,<br/>But to the other living called the dead,<br/>Whose dear, paternal images appear<br/>Not wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine here;<br/>Whose simple lives, complete and without flaw,<br/>Were part and parcel of great Nature's law;<br/>Who said not to their Lord, as if afraid,<br/>"Here is thy talent in a napkin laid,"<br/>But labored in their sphere, as men who live<br/>In the delight that work alone can give.<br/>Peace be to them; eternal peace and rest,<br/>And the fulfilment of the great behest:<br/>"Ye have been faithful over a few things,<br/>Over ten cities shall ye reign as kings."<br/><br/>And ye who fill the places we once filled,<br/>And follow in the furrows that we tilled,<br/>Young men, whose generous hearts are beating high,<br/>We who are old, and are about to die,<br/>Salute you; hail you; take your hands in ours,<br/>And crown you with our welcome as with flowers!<br/><br/>How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams<br/>With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!<br/>Book of Beginnings, Story without End,<br/>Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!<br/>Aladdin's Lamp, and Fortunatus' Purse,<br/>That holds the treasures of the universe!<br/>All possibilities are in its hands,<br/>No danger daunts it, and no foe withstands;<br/>In its sublime audacity of faith,<br/>"Be thou removed!" it to the mountain saith,<br/>And with ambitious feet, secure and proud,<br/>Ascends the ladder leaning on the cloud!<br/><br/>As ancient Priam at the Sc–∂an gate<br/>Sat on the walls of Troy in regal state<br/>With the old men, too old and weak to fight,<br/>Chirping like grasshoppers in their delight<br/>To see the embattled hosts, with spear and shield,<br/>Of Trojans and Achaians in the field;<br/>So from the snowy summits of our years<br/>We see you in the plain, as each appears,<br/>And question of you; asking, "Who is he<br/>That towers above the others? Which may be<br/>Atreides, Menelaus, Odysseus,<br/>Ajax the great, or bold Idomeneus?"<br/><br/>Let him not boast who puts his armor on<br/>As he who puts it off, the battle done.<br/>Study yourselves; and most of all note well<br/>Wherein kind Nature meant you to excel.<br/>Not every blossom ripens into fruit;<br/>Minerva, the inventress of the flute,<br/>Flung it aside, when she her face surveyed<br/>Distorted in a fountain as she played;<br/>The unlucky Marsyas found it, and his fate<br/>Was one to make the bravest hesitate.<br/><br/><br/>Write on your doors the saying wise and old,<br/>"Be bold! be bold!" and everywhere, "Be bold;<br/>Be not too bold!" Yet better the excess<br/>Than the defect; better the more than less;<br/>Better like Hector in the field to die,<br/>Than like a perfumed Paris turn and fly.<br/><br/><br/>And now, my classmates; ye remaining few<br/>That number not the half of those we knew,<br/>Ye, against whose familiar names not yet<br/>The fatal asterisk of death is set,<br/>Ye I salute! The horologe of Time<br/>Strikes the half-century with a solemn chime,<br/>And summons us together once again,<br/>The joy of meeting not unmixed with pain.<br/><br/><br/>Where are the others? Voices from the deep<br/>Caverns of darkness answer me: "They sleep!"<br/>I name no names; instinctively I feel<br/>Each at some well-remembered grave will kneel,<br/>And from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss,<br/>For every heart best knoweth its own loss.<br/>I see their scattered gravestones gleaming white<br/>Through the pale dusk of the impending night;<br/>O'er all alike the impartial sunset throws<br/>Its golden lilies mingled with the rose;<br/>We give to each a tender thought, and pass<br/>Out of the graveyards with their tangled grass,<br/>Unto these scenes frequented by our feet<br/>When we were young, and life was fresh and sweet.<br/><br/><br/>What shall I say to you? What can I say<br/>Better than silence is? When I survey<br/>This throng of faces turned to meet my own,<br/>Friendly and fair, and yet to me unknown,<br/>Transformed the very landscape seems to be;<br/>It is the same, yet not the same to me.<br/>So many memories crowd upon my brain,<br/>So many ghosts are in the wooded plain,<br/>I fain would steal away, with noiseless tread,<br/>As from a house where some one lieth dead.<br/>I cannot go;--I pause;--I hesitate;<br/>My feet reluctant linger at the gate;<br/>As one who struggles in a troubled dream<br/>To speak and cannot, to myself I seem.<br/><br/><br/>Vanish the dream! Vanish the idle fears!<br/>Vanish the rolling mists of fifty years!<br/>Whatever time or space may intervene,<br/>I will not be a stranger in this scene.<br/>Here every doubt, all indecision, ends;<br/>Hail, my companions, comrades, classmates, friends!<br/><br/><br/>Ah me! the fifty years since last we met<br/>Seem to me fifty folios bound and set<br/>By Time, the great transcriber, on his shelves,<br/>Wherein are written the histories of ourselves.<br/>What tragedies, what comedies, are there;<br/>What joy and grief, what rapture and despair!<br/>What chronicles of triumph and defeat,<br/>Of struggle, and temptation, and retreat!<br/>What records of regrets, and doubts, and fears!<br/>What pages blotted, blistered by our tears!<br/>What lovely landscapes on the margin shine,<br/>What sweet, angelic faces, what divine<br/>And holy images of love and trust,<br/>Undimmed by age, unsoiled by damp or dust!<br/>Whose hand shall dare to open and explore<br/>These volumes, closed and clasped forevermore?<br/>Not mine. With reverential feet I pass;<br/>I hear a voice that cries, "Alas! alas!<br/>Whatever hath been written shall remain,<br/>Nor be erased nor written o'er again;<br/>The unwritten only still belongs to thee:<br/>Take heed, and ponder well what that shall be."<br/><br/><br/>As children frightened by a thunder-cloud<br/>Are reassured if some one reads aloud<br/>A tale of wonder, with enchantment fraught,<br/>Or wild adventure, that diverts their thought,<br/>Let me endeavor with a tale to chase<br/>The gathering shadows of the time and place,<br/>And banish what we all too deeply feel<br/>Wholly to say, or wholly to conceal.<br/><br/><br/>In medi–∂val Rome, I know not where,<br/>There stood an image with its arm in air,<br/>And on its lifted finger, shining clear,<br/>A golden ring with the device, "Strike here!"<br/>Greatly the people wondered, though none guessed<br/>The meaning that these words but half expressed,<br/>Until a learned clerk, who at noonday<br/>With downcast eyes was passing on his way,<br/>Paused, and observed the spot, and marked it well,<br/>Whereon the shadow of the finger fell;<br/>And, coming back at midnight, delved, and found<br/>A secret stairway leading underground.<br/>Down this he passed into a spacious hall,<br/>Lit by a flaming jewel on the wall;<br/>And opposite, in threatening attitude,<br/>With bow and shaft a brazen statue stood.<br/>Upon its forehead, like a coronet,<br/>Were these mysterious words of menace set:<br/>"That which I am, I am; my fatal aim<br/>None can escape, not even yon luminous flame!"<br/><br/><br/>Midway the hall was a fair table placed,<br/>With cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased<br/>With rubies, and the plates and knives were gold,<br/>And gold the bread and viands manifold.<br/>Around it, silent, motionless, and sad,<br/>Were seated gallant knights in armor clad,<br/>And ladies beautiful with plume and zone,<br/>But they were stone, their hearts within were stone;<br/>And the vast hall was filled in every part<br/>With silent crowds, stony in face and heart.<br/><br/><br/>Long at the scene, bewildered and amazed<br/>The trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed;<br/>Then from the table, by his greed made bold,<br/>He seized a goblet and a knife of gold,<br/>And suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang,<br/>The vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang,<br/>The archer sped his arrow, at their call,<br/>Shattering the lambent jewel on the wall,<br/>And all was dark around and overhead;--<br/>Stark on the floor the luckless clerk lay dead!<br/><br/><br/>The writer of this legend then records<br/>Its ghostly application in these words:<br/>The image is the Adversary old,<br/>Whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold;<br/>Our lusts and passions are the downward stair<br/>That leads the soul from a diviner air;<br/>The archer, Death; the flaming jewel, Life;<br/>Terrestrial goods, the goblet and the knife;<br/>The knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone<br/>By avarice have been hardened into stone;<br/>The clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf<br/>Tempts from his books and from his nobler self.<br/><br/><br/>The scholar and the world! The endless strife,<br/>The discord in the harmonies of life!<br/>The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,<br/>And all the sweet serenity of books;<br/>The market-place, the eager love of gain,<br/>Whose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain!<br/><br/><br/>But why, you ask me, should this tale be told<br/>To men grown old, or who are growing old?<br/>It is too late! Ah, nothing is too late<br/>Till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.<br/>Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles<br/>Wrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides<br/>Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers,<br/>When each had numbered more than fourscore years,<br/>And Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten,<br/>Had but begun his "Characters of Men."<br/>Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,<br/>At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;<br/>Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,<br/>Completed Faust when eighty years were past.<br/>These are indeed exceptions; but they show<br/>How far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow<br/>Into the arctic regions of our lives,<br/>Where little else than life itself survives.<br/>As the barometer foretells the storm<br/>While still the skies are clear, the weather warm<br/>So something in us, as old age draws near,<br/>Betrays the pressure of the atmosphere.<br/>The nimble mercury, ere we are aware,<br/>Descends the elastic ladder of the air;<br/>The telltale blood in artery and vein<br/>Sinks from its higher levels in the brain;<br/>Whatever poet, orator, or sage<br/>May say of it, old age is still old age.<br/>It is the waning, not the crescent moon;<br/>The dusk of evening, not the blaze of noon;<br/>It is not strength, but weakness; not desire,<br/>But its surcease; not the fierce heat of fire,<br/>The burning and consuming element,<br/>But that of ashes and of embers spent,<br/>In which some living sparks we still discern,<br/>Enough to warm, but not enough to burn.<br/><br/><br/>What then? Shall we sit idly down and say<br/>The night hath come; it is no longer day?<br/>The night hath not yet come; we are not quite<br/>Cut off from labor by the failing light;<br/>Something remains for us to do or dare;<br/>Even the oldest tree some fruit may bear;<br/>Not Oedipus Coloneus, or Greek Ode,<br/>Or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode<br/>Out of the gateway of the Tabard Inn,<br/>But other something, would we but begin;<br/>For age is opportunity no less<br/>Than youth itself, though in another dress,<br/>And as the evening twilight fades away<br/>The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.
