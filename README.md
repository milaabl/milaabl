# üíÆ The Blues: A Literary Eclogue by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    "Nimium ne crede colori."--Virgil,<br/><br/>ECLOGUE THE FIRST.<br/><br/>          _London.--Before the Door of a Lecture Room_.<br/><br/>                 _Enter_ TRACY, _meeting_ INKEL.<br/><br/>_Ink_. You're too late.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                  Is it over?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                              Nor will be this hour.<br/>But the benches are crammed, like a garden in flower.<br/>With the pride of our belles, who have made it the fashion;<br/>So, instead of "beaux arts," we may say "la _belle_ passion"<br/>For learning, which lately has taken the lead in<br/>The world, and set all the fine gentlemen reading.<br/><br/>_Tra_. I know it too well, and have worn out my patience<br/>With studying to study your new publications.<br/>There's Vamp, Scamp, and Mouthy, and Wordswords and Co.<br/>With their damnable----<br/><br/>_Ink_.                  Hold, my good friend, do you know<br/>Whom you speak to?<br/><br/>_Tra_.            Right well, boy, and so does "the Row:"<br/>You're an author--a poet--<br/><br/>_Ink_.                     And think you that I<br/>Can stand tamely in silence, to hear you decry<br/>The Muses?<br/><br/>_Tra_.    Excuse me: I meant no offence<br/>To the Nine; though the number who make some pretence<br/>To their favours is such----but the subject to drop,<br/>I am just piping hot from a publisher's shop,<br/>(Next door to the pastry-cook's; so that when I<br/>Cannot find the new volume I wanted to buy<br/>On the bibliopole's shelves, it is only two paces,<br/>As one finds every author in one of those places:)<br/>Where I just had been skimming a charming critique,<br/>So studded with wit, and so sprinkled with Greek!<br/>Where your friend--you know who--has just got such a threshing,<br/>That it is, as the phrase goes, extremely "_refreshing._"<br/>What a beautiful word!<br/><br/>_Ink_.                Very true; 'tis so soft<br/>And so cooling--they use it a little too oft;<br/>And the papers have got it at last--but no matter.<br/>So they've cut up our friend then?<br/><br/>_Tra_.                            Not left him a tatter--<br/>Not a rag of his present or past reputation,<br/>Which they call a disgrace to the age, and the nation.<br/><br/>_Ink_. I'm sorry to hear this! for friendship, you know--<br/>Our poor friend!--but I thought it would terminate so.<br/>Our friendship is such, I'll read nothing to shock it.<br/>You don't happen to have the Review in your pocket?<br/><br/>_Tra_. No; I left a round dozen of authors and others<br/>(Very sorry, no doubt, since the cause is a brother's)<br/>All scrambling and jostling, like so many imps,<br/>And on fire with impatience to get the next glimpse.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Let us join them.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                  What, won't you return to the lecture?<br/><br/>_Ink_. Why the place is so crammed, there's not room for a spectre.<br/>Besides, our friend Scamp is to-day so absurd--<br/><br/>_Tra_. How can you know that till you hear him?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                          I heard<br/>Quite enough; and, to tell you the truth, my retreat<br/>Was from his vile nonsense, no less than the heat.<br/><br/>_Tra_. I have had no great loss then?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                Loss!--such a palaver!<br/>I'd inoculate sooner my wife with the slaver<br/>Of a dog when gone rabid, than listen two hours<br/>To the torrent of trash which around him he pours,<br/>Pumped up with such effort, disgorged with such labour,<br/>That----come--do not make me speak ill of one's neighbour.<br/><br/>_Tra_. _I_ make you!<br/><br/>_Ink_.                   Yes, you! I said nothing until<br/>You compelled me, by speaking the truth----<br/><br/>_Tra_.                               _To speak ill?_<br/>Is that your deduction?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                 When speaking of Scamp ill,<br/>I certainly _follow, not set_ an example.<br/>The fellow's a fool, an impostor, a zany.<br/><br/>_Tra_. And the crowd of to-day shows that one fool makes many.<br/>But we two will be wise.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                  Pray, then, let us retire.<br/><br/>_Tra_. I would, but----<br/><br/>_Ink_.                There must be attraction much higher<br/>Than Scamp, or the Jew's harp he nicknames his lyre,<br/>To call you to this hotbed.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                     I own it--'tis true--<br/>A fair lady----<br/><br/>_Ink_.       A spinster?<br/><br/>_Tra_.                  Miss Lilac.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                               The Blue!<br/><br/>_Tra_. The heiress! The angel!<br/><br/>_Ink_.                         The devil! why, man,<br/>Pray get out of this hobble as fast as you can.<br/>_You_ wed with Miss Lilac! 'twould be your perdition:<br/>She's a poet, a chymist, a mathematician.<br/><br/>_Tra_. I say she's an angel.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                      Say rather an angle.<br/>If you and she marry, you'll certainly wrangle.<br/>I say she's a Blue, man, as blue as the ether.<br/><br/>_Tra_. And is that any cause for not coming together?<br/><br/>_Ink_. Humph! I can't say I know any happy alliance<br/>Which has lately sprung up from a wedlock with science.<br/>She's so learn√©d in all things, and fond of concerning<br/>Herself in all matters connected with learning,<br/>That----<br/><br/>_Tra_.  What?<br/><br/>_Ink_.        I perhaps may as well hold my tongue;<br/>But there's five hundred people can tell you you're<br/>wrong.<br/><br/>_Tra_. You forget Lady Lilac's as rich as a Jew.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Is it miss or the cash of mamma you pursue?<br/><br/>_Tra_. Why, Jack, I'll be frank with you--something of both.<br/>The girl's a fine girl.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                 And you feel nothing loth<br/>To her good lady-mother's reversion; and yet<br/>Her life is as good as your own, I will bet.<br/><br/>_Tra_. Let her live, and as long as she likes; I demand<br/>Nothing more than the heart of her daughter and hand.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Why, that heart's in the inkstand--that hand on the pen.<br/><br/>_Tra_. A propos--Will you write me a song now and then?<br/><br/>_Ink_. To what purpose?<br/><br/>_Tra_.                 You know, my dear friend, that in prose<br/>My talent is decent, as far as it goes;<br/>But in rhyme----<br/><br/>_Ink_.         You're a terrible stick, to be sure.<br/><br/>_Tra_. I own it; and yet, in these times, there's no lure<br/>For the heart of the fair like a stanza or two;<br/>And so, as I can't, will you furnish a few?<br/><br/>_Ink_. In your name?<br/><br/>_Tra_.               In my name. I will copy them out,<br/>To slip into her hand at the very next rout.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Are you so far advanced as to hazard this?<br/><br/>_Tra_.                                            Why,<br/>Do you think me subdued by a Blue-stocking's eye,<br/>So far as to tremble to tell her in rhyme<br/>What I've told her in prose, at the least, as sublime?<br/><br/>_Ink_. _As sublime!_ If i be so, no need of my Muse.<br/><br/>_Tra_. But consider, dear Inkel, she's one of the "Blues."<br/><br/>_Ink_. As sublime!--Mr. Tracy--I've nothing to say.<br/>Stick to prose--As sublime!!--but I wish you good day.<br/><br/>_Tra_. Nay, stay, my dear fellow--consider--I'm wrong;<br/>I own it; but, prithee, compose me the song.<br/><br/>_Ink_. _As_ sublime!!<br/><br/>_Tra_.                 I but used the expression in haste.<br/><br/>_Ink_. That may be, Mr. Tracy, but shows damned bad taste.<br/><br/>_Tra_. I own it, I know it, acknowledge it--what<br/>Can I say to you more?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                 I see what you'd be at:<br/>You disparage my parts with insidious abuse,<br/>Till you think you can turn them best to your own use.<br/><br/>_Tra_. And is that not a sign I respect them?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                        Why that<br/>To be sure makes a difference.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                        I know what is what:<br/>And you, who're a man of the gay world, no less<br/>Than a poet of t'other, may easily guess<br/>That I never could mean, by a word, to offend<br/>A genius like you, and, moreover, my friend.<br/><br/>_Ink_. No doubt; you by this time should know what is due<br/>To a man of----but come--let us shake hands.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                                      You knew,<br/>And you _know_, my dear fellow, how heartily I,<br/>Whatever you publish, am ready to buy.<br/><br/>_Ink_. That's my bookseller's business; I care not for sale;<br/>Indeed the best poems at first rather fail.<br/>There were Renegade's epics, and Botherby's plays,<br/>And my own grand romance--<br/><br/>_Tra_.                     Had its full share of praise.<br/>I myself saw it puffed in the "Old Girl's Review."<br/><br/>_Ink_. What Review?<br/><br/>_Tra_.              Tis the English "Journal de Trevoux;"<br/>A clerical work of our Jesuits at home.<br/>Have you never yet seen it?<br/><br/>_Ink_.                     That pleasure's to come.<br/><br/>_Tra_. Make haste then.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                  Why so?<br/><br/>_Tra_.                         I have heard people say<br/>That it threatened to give up the _ghost_ t'other day.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Well, that is a sign of some _spirit_.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                                            No doubt.<br/>Shall you be at the Countess of Fiddlecome's rout?<br/><br/>_Ink_. I've a card, and shall go: but at present, as soon<br/>As friend Scamp shall be pleased to step down from the moon,<br/>(Where he seems to be soaring in search of his wits),<br/>And an interval grants from his lecturing fits,<br/>I'm engaged to the Lady Bluebottle's collation,<br/>To partake of a luncheon and learn'd conversation:<br/>'Tis a sort of reunion for Scamp, on the days<br/>Of his lecture, to treat him with cold tongue and praise.<br/>And I own, for my own part, that 'tis not unpleasant.<br/>Will you go? There's Miss Lilac will also be present.<br/><br/>_Tra_. That "metal's attractive."<br/><br/>_Ink_.                           No doubt--to the pocket.<br/><br/>_Tra_. You should rather encourage my passion than shock it.<br/>But let us proceed; for I think by the hum----<br/><br/>_Ink_. Very true; let us go, then, before they can come,<br/>Or else we'll be kept here an hour at their levee,<br/>On the rack of cross questions, by all the blue bevy.<br/>Hark! Zounds, they'll be on us; I know by the drone<br/>Of old Botherby's spouting ex-cathedr√¢ tone.<br/>Aye! there he is at it. Poor Scamp! better join<br/>Your friends, or he'll pay you back in your own coin.<br/><br/>_Tra_. All fair; 'tis but lecture for lecture.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                         That's clear.<br/>But for God's sake let's go, or the Bore will be here.<br/>Come, come: nay, I'm off.<br/>                                                        [_Exit_ INKEL.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                     You are right, and I'll follow;<br/>'Tis high time for a "_Sic me servavit Apollo_."<br/>And yet we shall have the whole crew on our kibes,<br/>Blues, dandies, and dowagers, and second-hand scribes,<br/>All flocking to moisten their exquisite throttles<br/>With a glass of Madeira at Lady Bluebottle's.<br/>                                                        [_Exit_ TRACY.<br/><br/>ECLOGUE THE SECOND.<br/><br/>   _An Apartment in the House of_ LADY BLUEBOTTLE.--_A Table prepared._<br/><br/>                 SIR RICHARD BLUEBOTTLE _solus_.<br/><br/>Was there ever a man who was married so sorry?<br/>Like a fool, I must needs do the thing in a hurry.<br/>My life is reversed, and my quiet destroyed;<br/>My days, which once passed in so gentle a void,<br/>Must now, every hour of the twelve, be employed;<br/>The twelve, do I say?--of the whole twenty-four,<br/>Is there one which I dare call my own any more?<br/>What with driving and visiting, dancing and dining,<br/>What with learning, and teaching, and scribbling, and shining,<br/>In science and art, I'll be cursed if I know<br/>Myself from my wife; for although we are two,<br/>Yet she somehow contrives that all things shall be done<br/>In a style which proclaims us eternally one.<br/>But the thing of all things which distresses me more<br/>Than the bills of the week (though they trouble me sore)<br/>Is the numerous, humorous, backbiting crew<br/>Of scribblers, wits, lecturers, white, black, and blue,<br/>Who are brought to my house as an inn, to my cost--<br/>For the bill here, it seems, is defrayed by the host--<br/>No pleasure! no leisure! no thought for my pains,<br/>But to hear a vile jargon which addles my brains;<br/>A smatter and chatter, gleaned out of reviews,<br/>By the rag, tag, and bobtail, of those they call "Blues;"<br/>A rabble who know not----But soft, here they come!<br/>Would to God I were deaf! as I'm not, I'll be dumb.<br/><br/>_Enter_ LADY BLUEBOTTLE, MISS LILAC, LADY BLUEMOUNT, MR. BOTHERBY,<br/>   INKEL, TRACY, MISS MAZARINE, _and others, with_ SCAMP _the Lecturer,<br/>                           etc., etc._<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_.<br/>Ah! Sir Richard, good morning: I've brought you some friends.<br/><br/>_Sir Rich_. (_bows, and afterwards aside_).<br/>If friends, they're the first.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_.                 But the luncheon attends.<br/>I pray ye be seated, "_sans c√©r√©monie_."<br/>Mr. Scamp, you're fatigued; take your chair there, next me.<br/>                                                      [_They all sit._<br/><br/>_Sir Rich_. (_aside_). If he does, his fatigue is to come.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_.                                             Mr. Tracy--<br/>Lady Bluemount--Miss Lilac--be pleased, pray, to place ye;<br/>And you, Mr. Botherby--<br/><br/>_Both_.                 Oh, my dear Lady,<br/>I obey.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. Mr. Inkel, I ought to upbraid ye:<br/>You were not at the lecture.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                      Excuse me, I was;<br/>But the heat forced me out in the best part--alas!<br/>And when--<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. To be sure it was broiling; but then<br/>You have lost such a lecture!<br/><br/>_Both_.                      The best of the ten.<br/><br/>_Tra_. How can you know that? there are two more.<br/><br/>_Both_.                                          Because<br/>I defy him to beat this day's wondrous applause.<br/>The very walls shook.<br/><br/>_Ink_.               Oh, if that be the test,<br/>I allow our friend Scamp has this day done his best.<br/>Miss Lilac, permit me to help you;--a wing?<br/><br/>_Miss Lil_. No more, sir, I thank you. Who lectures next spring?<br/><br/>_Both_. Dick Dunder.<br/><br/>_Ink_.               That is, if he lives.<br/><br/>_Miss Lil_.                               And why not?<br/><br/>_Ink_. No reason whatever, save that he's a sot.<br/>Lady Bluemount! a glass of Madeira?<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_.                      With pleasure.<br/><br/>_Ink_. How does your friend Wordswords, that Windermere treasure?<br/>Does he stick to his lakes, like the leeches he sings,<br/>And their gatherers, as Homer sung warriors and kings?<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. He has just got a place.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                 As a footman?<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_.                                       For shame!<br/>Nor profane with your sneers so poetic a name.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Nay, I meant him no evil, but pitied his master;<br/>For the poet of pedlers 'twere, sure, no disaster<br/>To wear a new livery; the more, as 'tis not<br/>The first time he has turned both his creed and his coat.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. For shame! I repeat. If Sir George could but hear--<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. Never mind our friend Inkel; we all know, my dear,<br/>'Tis his way.<br/><br/>_Sir Rich_.    But this place--<br/><br/>_Ink_.                          Is perhaps like friend Scamp's,<br/>A lecturer's.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. Excuse me--'tis one in the "Stamps:"<br/>He is made a collector.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                 Collector!<br/><br/>_Sir Rich_.                       How?<br/><br/>_Miss Lil_.                            What?<br/><br/>_Ink_. I shall think of him oft when I buy a new hat:<br/>There his works will appear--<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_.                Sir, they reach to the Ganges.<br/><br/>_Ink_. I sha'n't go so far--I can have them at Grange's.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. Oh fie!<br/><br/>_Miss Lil_.          And for shame!<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_.                      You're too bad.<br/><br/>_Both_.                                           Very good!<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. How good?<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_.          He means nought--'tis his phrase.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_.                                          He grows rude.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. He means nothing; nay, ask him.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_.                                Pray, Sir! did you mean<br/>What you say?<br/><br/>_Ink_.        Never mind if he did; 'twill be seen<br/>That whatever he means won't alloy what he says.<br/><br/>_Both_. Sir!<br/><br/>_Ink_.      Pray be content with your portion of praise;<br/>'Twas in your defence.<br/><br/>_Both_.               If you please, with submission<br/>I can make out my own.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                 It would be your perdition.<br/>While you live, my dear Botherby, never defend<br/>Yourself or your works; but leave both to a friend.<br/>Apropos--Is your play then accepted at last?<br/><br/>_Both_. At last?<br/><br/>_Ink_. Why I thought--that's to say--there had passed<br/>A few green-room whispers, which hinted,--you know<br/>That the taste of the actors at best is so so.<br/><br/>_Both_. Sir, the green-room's in rapture, and so's the Committee.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Aye--yours are the plays for exciting our "pity<br/>And fear," as the Greek says: for "purging the mind,"<br/>I doubt if you'll leave us an equal behind.<br/><br/>_Both_. I have written the prologue, and meant to have prayed<br/>For a spice of your wit in an epilogue's aid.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Well, time enough yet, when the play's to be played.<br/>Is it cast yet?<br/><br/>_Both_.         The actors are fighting for parts,<br/>As is usual in that most litigious of arts.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. We'll all make a party, and go the _first_ night.<br/><br/>_Tra_. And you promised the epilogue, Inkel.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                       Not quite.<br/>However, to save my friend Botherby trouble,<br/>I'll do what I can, though my pains must be double.<br/><br/>_Tra_. Why so?<br/><br/>_Ink_.          To do justice to what goes before.<br/><br/>_Both_. Sir, I'm happy to say, I've no fears on that score.<br/>Your parts, Mr. Inkel, are----<br/><br/>_Ink_.                    Never mind _mine_;<br/>Stick to those of your play, which is quite your own line.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. You're a fugitive writer, I think, sir, of rhymes?<br/><br/>_Ink_. Yes, ma'am; and a fugitive reader sometimes.<br/>On Wordswords, for instance, I seldom alight,<br/>Or on Mouthey, his friend, without taking to flight.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. Sir, your taste is too common; but time and posterity<br/>Will right these great men, and this age's severity<br/>Become its reproach.<br/><br/>_Ink_.               I've no sort of objection,<br/>So I'm not of the party to take the infection.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. Perhaps you have doubts that they ever will _take_?<br/><br/>_Ink_. Not at all; on the contrary, those of the lake<br/>Have taken already, and still will continue<br/>To take--what they can, from a groat to a guinea,<br/>Of pension or place;--but the subject's a bore.<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. Well, sir, the time's coming.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                                   Scamp! don't you feel sore?<br/>What say you to this?<br/><br/>_Scamp_.             They have merit, I own;<br/>Though their system's absurdity keeps it unknown,<br/><br/>_Ink_. Then why not unearth it in one of your lectures?<br/><br/>_Scamp_. It is only time past which comes under my strictures.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. Come, a truce with all tartness;--the joy of my heart<br/>Is to see Nature's triumph o'er all that is art.<br/>Wild Nature!--Grand Shakespeare!<br/><br/>_Both_.                         And down Aristotle!<br/><br/>_Lady Bluem_. Sir George thinks exactly with Lady Bluebottle:<br/>And my Lord Seventy-four, who protects our dear Bard,<br/>And who gave him his place, has the greatest regard<br/>For the poet, who, singing of pedlers and asses,<br/>Has found out the way to dispense with Parnassus.<br/><br/>_Tra_. And you, Scamp!--<br/><br/>_Scamp_.                I needs must confess I'm embarrassed.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Don't call upon Scamp, who's already so harassed<br/>With old _schools_, and new _schools_,<br/>                         and no _schools_, and all _schools_.<br/><br/>_Tra_. Well, one thing is certain, that _some_ must be fools.<br/>I should like to know who.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                   And I should not be sorry<br/>To know who are _not_:--it would save us some worry.<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. A truce with remark, and let nothing control<br/>This "feast of our reason, and flow of the soul."<br/>Oh! my dear Mr. Botherby! sympathise!--I<br/>Now feel such a rapture, I'm ready to fly,<br/>I feel so elastic--"_so buoyant--so buoyant!_"<br/><br/>_Ink_. Tracy! open the window.<br/><br/>_Tra_.                         I wish her much joy on't.<br/><br/>_Both_. For God's sake, my Lady Bluebottle, check not<br/>This gentle emotion, so seldom our lot<br/>Upon earth. Give it way: 'tis an impulse which lifts<br/>Our spirits from earth--the sublimest of gifts;<br/>For which poor Prometheus was chained to his mountain:<br/>'Tis the source of all sentiment--feeling's true fountain;<br/>'Tis the Vision of Heaven upon Earth: 'tis the gas<br/>Of the soul: 'tis the seizing of shades as they pass,<br/>And making them substance: 'tis something divine:--<br/><br/>_Ink_. Shall I help you, my friend, to a little more wine?<br/><br/>_Both_. I thank you: not any more, sir, till I dine.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Apropos--Do you dine with Sir Humphry to day?<br/><br/>_Tra_. I should think with _Duke_ Humphry was more in your way.<br/><br/>_Ink_. It might be of yore; but we authors now look<br/>To the Knight, as a landlord, much more than the Duke.<br/>The truth is, each writer now quite at his ease is,<br/>And (except with his publisher) dines where he pleases.<br/>But 'tis now nearly five, and I must to the Park.<br/><br/>_Tra_. And I'll take a turn with you there till 'tis dark.<br/>And you, Scamp--<br/><br/>_Scamp_.          Excuse me! I must to my notes,<br/>For my lecture next week.<br/><br/>_Ink_. He must mind whom he quotes<br/>Out of "Elegant Extracts."<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_.             Well, now we break up;<br/>But remember Miss Diddle invites us to sup.<br/><br/>_Ink_. Then at two hours past midnight we all meet again,<br/>For the sciences, sandwiches, hock, and champagne!<br/><br/>_Tra_. And the sweet lobster salad!<br/><br/>_Both_.                               I honour that meal;<br/>For 'tis then that our feelings most genuinely--feel.<br/><br/>_Ink_. True; feeling is truest _then_, far beyond question:<br/>I wish to the gods 'twas the same with digestion!<br/><br/>_Lady Blueb_. Pshaw!--never mind that; for one moment of feeling<br/>Is worth--God knows what.<br/><br/>_Ink_.                  'Tis at least worth concealing<br/>For itself, or what follows--But here comes your carriage.<br/><br/>_Sir Rich_. (_aside_).<br/>I wish all these people were d----d with _my_ marriage!<br/>                                                            [_Exeunt._
