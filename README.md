# üíÆ An Essay on Criticism. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    PART FIRST.<br/><br/>'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill<br/>Appear in writing or in judging ill;<br/>But, of the two, less dangerous is the offence<br/>To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.<br/>Some few in that, but numbers err in this;<br/>Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;<br/>A fool might once himself alone expose,<br/>Now one in verse makes many more in prose.<br/><br/>'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none<br/>Go just alike, yet each believes his own.<br/>In poets as true genius is but rare,<br/>True taste as seldom, is the critic's share;<br/>Both must alike from Heaven derive their light,<br/>These born to judge, as well as those to write.<br/>Let such teach others who themselves excel.<br/>And censure freely who have written well.<br/>Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,<br/>But are not critics to their judgment too?<br/><br/>Yet if we look more closely, we shall find<br/>Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:<br/>Nature affords at least a glimmering light;<br/>The lines, though touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.<br/>But as the slightest sketch, if justly traced,<br/>Is by ill colouring but the more disgraced,<br/>So by false learning is good sense defaced:<br/>Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,<br/>And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.<br/>In search of wit these lose their common sense,<br/>And then turn critics in their own defence:<br/>Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,<br/>Or with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.<br/>All fools have still an itching to deride,<br/>And fain would be upon the laughing side;<br/>If Maevius scribble in Apollo's spite,<br/>There are who judge still worse than he can write.<br/><br/>Some have at first for wits, then poets pass'd,<br/>Turn'd critics next, and proved plain fools at last.<br/>Some neither can for wits nor critics pass,<br/>As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.<br/>Those half-learn'd witlings, numerous in our isle,<br/>As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile;<br/>Unfinished things, one knows not what to call,<br/>Their generation's so equivocal:<br/>To tell 'em would a hundred tongues require,<br/>Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.<br/><br/>But you who seek to give and merit fame,<br/>And justly bear a critic's noble name,<br/>Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,<br/>How far your genius, taste, and learning go;<br/>Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,<br/>And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.<br/><br/>Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,<br/>And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit.<br/>As on the land while here the ocean gains,<br/>In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;<br/>Thus in the soul while memory prevails,<br/>The solid power of understanding fails;<br/>Where beams of warm imagination play,<br/>The memory's soft figures melt away.<br/>One science only will one genius fit,<br/>So vast is art, so narrow human wit:<br/>Not only bounded to peculiar arts,<br/>But oft in those confined to single parts.<br/>Like kings, we lose the conquests gain'd before,<br/>By vain ambition still to make them more;<br/>Each might his several province well command,<br/>Would all but stoop to what they understand.<br/><br/>First follow Nature, and your judgment frame<br/>By her just standard, which is still the same:<br/>Unerring Nature, still divinely bright,<br/>One clear, unchanged, and universal light,<br/>Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,<br/>At once the source, and end, and test of Art.<br/>Art from that fund each just supply provides,<br/>Works without show, and without pomp presides;<br/>In some fair body thus the informing soul<br/>With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,<br/>Each motion guides, and every nerve sustains,<br/>Itself unseen, but in the effects, remains.<br/>Some, to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse,<br/>Want as much more to turn it to its use;<br/>For wit and judgment often are at strife,<br/>Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife,<br/>'Tis more to guide than spur the Muse's steed,<br/>Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;<br/>The wing√®d courser, like a generous horse,<br/>Shows most true mettle when you check his course.<br/><br/>Those rules, of old discover'd, not devised,<br/>Are Nature still, but Nature methodised;<br/>Nature, like liberty, is but restrain'd<br/>By the same laws which first herself ordain'd.<br/>Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,<br/>When to repress, and when indulge our flights:<br/>High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,<br/>And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;<br/>Held from afar, aloft, the immortal prize,<br/>And urged the rest by equal steps to rise.<br/>Just precepts thus from great examples given,<br/>She drew from them what they derived from Heaven.<br/>The generous critic fann'd the poet's fire,<br/>And taught the world with reason to admire.<br/>Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid proved,<br/>To dress her charms, and make her more beloved:<br/>But following wits from that intention stray'd,<br/>Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;<br/>Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,<br/>Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.<br/>So modern 'pothecaries, taught the art,<br/>By doctor's bills to play the doctor's part,<br/>Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,<br/>Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.<br/>Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,<br/>Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.<br/>Some drily plain, without invention's aid,<br/>Write dull receipts how poems may be made.<br/>These leave the sense, their learning to display,<br/>And those explain the meaning quite away.<br/><br/>You then, whose judgment the right course would steer,<br/>Know well each ancient's proper character;<br/>His fable, subject, scope in every page;<br/>Religion, country, genius of his age;<br/>Without all these at once before your eyes,<br/>Cavil you may, but never criticise.<br/>Be Homer's works your study and delight,<br/>Read them by day, and meditate by night;<br/>Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,<br/>And trace the Muses upward to their spring.<br/>Still with itself compared, his text peruse;<br/>And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.<br/>When first young Maro in his boundless mind,<br/>A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,<br/>Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,<br/>And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:<br/>But when t' examine every part he came,<br/>Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.<br/>Convinced, amazed, he checks the bold design,<br/>And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,<br/>As if the Stagyrite o'erlook'd each line.<br/>Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;<br/>To copy nature is to copy them.<br/>Some beauties yet no precepts can declare,<br/>For there's a happiness as well as care.<br/>Music resembles poetry, in each<br/>Are nameless graces which no methods teach,<br/>And which a master-hand alone can reach.<br/>If, where the rules not far enough extend,<br/>(Since rules were made but to promote their end)<br/>Some lucky license answer to the full<br/>The intent proposed, that license is a rule;<br/>Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,<br/>May boldly deviate from the common track;<br/>Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,<br/>And rise to faults true critics dare not mend,<br/>From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,<br/>And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,<br/>Which, without passing through the judgment, gains<br/>The heart, and all its end at once attains.<br/>In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes,<br/>Which out of nature's common order rise,<br/>The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.<br/>But though the ancients thus their rules invade,<br/>(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)<br/>Moderns, beware! or if you must offend<br/>Against the precept, ne'er transgress its end;<br/>Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need,<br/>And have at least their precedent to plead.<br/>The critic else proceeds without remorse,<br/>Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.<br/><br/>I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts,<br/>Those freer beauties, even in them, seem faults.<br/>Some figures monstrous and misshaped appear,<br/>Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,<br/>Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,<br/>Due distance reconciles to form and grace.<br/>A prudent chief not always must display<br/>His powers in equal ranks, and fair array,<br/>But with the occasion and the place comply,<br/>Conceal his force, nay, seem sometimes to fly.<br/>Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,<br/>Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.<br/><br/>Still green with bays each ancient altar stands,<br/>Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;<br/>Secure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,<br/>Destructive war, and all-involving age.<br/>See from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!<br/>Hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring!<br/>In praise so just let every voice be join'd,<br/>And fill the general chorus of mankind.<br/>Hail, Bards triumphant! born in happier days;<br/>Immortal heirs of universal praise!<br/>Whose honours with increase of ages grow,<br/>As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow;<br/>Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,<br/>And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!<br/>Oh may some spark of your celestial fire,<br/>The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,<br/>(That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights,<br/>Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)<br/>To teach vain wits a science little known,<br/>T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!<br/><br/>PART SECOND.<br/><br/>Of all the causes which conspire to blind<br/>Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,<br/>What the weak head with strongest bias rules,<br/>Is PRIDE, the never-failing vice of fools.<br/>Whatever Nature has in worth denied,<br/>She gives in large recruits of needless pride;<br/>For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find<br/>What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind:<br/>Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,<br/>And fills up all the mighty void of sense:<br/>If once right reason drives that cloud away,<br/>Truth breaks upon us with resistless day.<br/>Trust not yourself; but your defects to know,<br/>Make use of every friend--and every foe.<br/><br/>A little learning is a dangerous thing;<br/>Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:<br/>There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,<br/>And drinking largely sobers us again.<br/>Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts,<br/>In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,<br/>While from the bounded level of our mind,<br/>Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;<br/>But, more advanced, behold with strange surprise,<br/>New distant scenes of endless science rise!<br/>So, pleased at first the towering Alps we try,<br/>Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,<br/>The eternal snows appear already past,<br/>And the first clouds and mountains seem the last:<br/>But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey<br/>The growing labours of the lengthen'd way,<br/>The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes,<br/>Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!<br/><br/>A perfect judge will read each work of wit<br/>With the same spirit that its author writ:<br/>Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find<br/>Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;<br/>Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,<br/>The generous pleasure to be charm'd with wit.<br/>But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow,<br/>Correctly cold, and regularly low,<br/>That, shunning faults, one quiet tenor keep,<br/>We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.<br/>In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts<br/>Is not the exactness of peculiar parts;<br/>'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,<br/>But the joint force and full result of all.<br/>Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,<br/>(The world's just wonder, and even thine, O Rome!)<br/>No single parts unequally surprise,<br/>All comes united to th' admiring eyes;<br/>No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;<br/>The whole at once is bold, and regular.<br/><br/>Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,<br/>Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.<br/>In every work regard the writer's end,<br/>Since none can compass more than they intend;<br/>And if the means be just, the conduct true,<br/>Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due.<br/>As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,<br/>To avoid great errors, must the less commit:<br/>Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays,<br/>For not to know some trifles is a praise.<br/>Most critics, fond of some subservient art,<br/>Still make the whole depend upon a part:<br/>They talk of principles, but notions prize,<br/>And all to one loved folly sacrifice.<br/><br/>Once on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say,<br/>A certain bard encountering on the way,<br/>Discoursed in terms as just, with looks as sage,<br/>As e'er could Dennis, of the Grecian stage;<br/>Concluding all were desperate sots and fools,<br/>Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.<br/>Our author, happy in a judge so nice,<br/>Produced his play, and begg'd the knight's advice;<br/>Made him observe the subject, and the plot,<br/>The Manners, Passions, Unities; what not?<br/>All which, exact to rule, were brought about,<br/>Were but a combat in the lists left out.<br/>'What! leave the combat out?' exclaims the knight.<br/>'Yes, or we must renounce the Stagyrite.'<br/>'Not so, by Heaven!' (he answers in a rage);<br/>'Knights, squires, and steeds must enter on the stage.'<br/>'So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.'<br/>'Then build a new, or act it in a plain.'<br/><br/>Thus critics, of less judgment than caprice,<br/>Curious, not knowing, not exact but nice,<br/>Form short ideas, and offend in arts<br/>(As most in manners) by a love to parts.<br/><br/>Some to conceit alone their taste confine,<br/>And glittering thoughts struck out at every line;<br/>Pleased with a work where nothing's just or fit;<br/>One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.<br/>Poets, like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace<br/>The naked nature and the living grace,<br/>With gold and jewels cover every part,<br/>And hide with ornaments their want of art.<br/>True wit is nature to advantage dress'd;<br/>What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;<br/>Something, whose truth convinced at sight we find,<br/>That gives us back the image of our mind.<br/>As shades more sweetly recommend the light,<br/>So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.<br/>For works may have more wit than does 'em good,<br/>As bodies perish through excess of blood.<br/><br/>Others for language all their care express,<br/>And value books, as women men, for dress:<br/>Their praise is still--'The style is excellent;'<br/>The sense, they humbly take upon content.<br/>Words are like leaves, and where they most abound,<br/>Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.<br/>False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,<br/>Its gaudy colours spreads on every place;<br/>The face of Nature we no more survey,<br/>All glares alike, without distinction gay;<br/>But true expression, like the unchanging sun,<br/>Clears, and improves whate'er it shines upon;<br/>It gilds all objects, but it alters none.<br/>Expression is the dress of thought, and still<br/>Appears more decent, as more suitable;<br/>A vile conceit in pompous words express'd,<br/>Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd:<br/>For different styles with different subjects sort,<br/>As several garbs with country, town, and court.<br/>Some by old words to fame have made pretence,<br/>Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;<br/>Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style,<br/>Amaze the unlearn'd, and make the learn√®d smile.<br/>Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play,<br/>These sparks with awkward vanity display<br/>What the fine gentleman wore yesterday;<br/>And but so mimic ancient wits at best,<br/>As apes our grandsires, in their doublets dress'd.<br/>In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;<br/>Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:<br/>Be not the first by whom the new are tried,<br/>Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.<br/><br/>But most by numbers judge a poet's song;<br/>And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong:<br/>In the bright Muse, though thousand charms conspire,<br/>Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;<br/>Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,<br/>Not mend their minds; as some to church repair,<br/>Not for the doctrine, but the music there.<br/>These equal syllables alone require,<br/>Though oft the ear the open vowels tire;<br/>While expletives their feeble aid do join,<br/>And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:<br/>While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,<br/>With sure returns of still expected rhymes;<br/>Where'er you find 'the cooling western breeze,'<br/>In the next line, it 'whispers through the trees:'<br/>If crystal streams 'with pleasing murmurs creep,'<br/>The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with 'sleep:'<br/>Then, at the last and only couplet fraught<br/>With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,<br/>A needless Alexandrine ends the song<br/>That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.<br/>Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know<br/>What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow;<br/>And praise the easy vigour of a line,<br/>Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.<br/>True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,<br/>As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.<br/>'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,<br/>The sound must seem an echo to the sense;<br/>Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,<br/>And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows:<br/>But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,<br/>The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.<br/>When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,<br/>The line too labours, and the words move slow;<br/>Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,<br/>Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main.<br/>Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise,<br/>And bid alternate passions fall and rise!<br/>While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove<br/>Now burns with glory, and then melts with love;<br/>Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,<br/>Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:<br/>Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,<br/>And the world's victor stood subdued by sound!<br/>The power of music all our hearts allow,<br/>And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.<br/><br/>Avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such<br/>Who still are pleased, too little or too much.<br/>At every trifle scorn to take offence:<br/>That always shows great pride or little sense;<br/>Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best<br/>Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.<br/>Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move,<br/>For fools admire, but men of sense approve:<br/>As things seem large which we through mists descry,<br/>Dulness is ever apt to magnify.<br/><br/>Some, foreign writers, some, our own despise;<br/>The ancients only, or the moderns prize.<br/>Thus wit, like faith, by each man is applied<br/>To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.<br/>Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,<br/>And force that sun but on a part to shine,<br/>Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,<br/>But ripens spirits in cold northern climes;<br/>Which from the first has shone on ages past,<br/>Enlights the present, and shall warm the last;<br/>Though each may feel increases and decays,<br/>And see now clearer and now darker days.<br/>Regard not then if wit be old or new,<br/>But blame the false, and value still the true.<br/><br/>Some ne'er advance a judgment of their own,<br/>But catch the spreading notion of the town;<br/>They reason and conclude by precedent,<br/>And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.<br/>Some judge of authors' names, not works, and then<br/>Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.<br/>Of all this servile herd, the worst is he<br/>That in proud dulness joins with quality;<br/>A constant critic at the great man's board,<br/>To fetch and carry nonsense for my lord.<br/>What woful stuff this madrigal would be,<br/>In some starved hackney sonnetteer, or me?<br/>But let a lord once own the happy lines<br/>How the wit brightens! how the style refines!<br/>Before his sacred name flies every fault,<br/>And each exalted stanza teems with thought!<br/><br/>The vulgar thus through imitation err;<br/>As oft the learn'd by being singular:<br/>So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng<br/>By chance go right, they purposely go wrong:<br/>So schismatics the plain believers quit,<br/>And are but damn'd for having too much wit.<br/>Some praise at morning what they blame at night,<br/>But always think the last opinion right.<br/>A Muse by these is like a mistress used,<br/>This hour she's idolised, the next abused;<br/>While their weak heads, like towns unfortified,<br/>'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.<br/>Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say;<br/>And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.<br/>We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow;<br/>Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.<br/>Once school-divines this zealous isle o'erspread;<br/>Who knew most sentences, was deepest read;<br/>Faith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed,<br/>And none had sense enough to be confuted:<br/>Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain,<br/>Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane.<br/>If Faith itself has different dresses worn,<br/>What wonder modes in wit should take their turn?<br/>Oft, leaving what is natural and fit,<br/>The current folly proves the ready wit,<br/>And authors think their reputation safe<br/>Which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh.<br/><br/>Some valuing those of their own side or mind,<br/>Still make themselves the measure of mankind:<br/>Fondly we think we honour merit then,<br/>When we but praise ourselves in other men.<br/>Parties in wit attend on those of state,<br/>And public faction doubles private hate.<br/>Pride, malice, folly, against Dryden rose,<br/>In various shapes of parsons, critics, beaux;<br/>But sense survived, when merry jests were past;<br/>For rising merit will buoy up at last.<br/>Might he return, and bless once more our eyes,<br/>New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise:<br/>Nay, should great Homer lift his awful head,<br/>Zoilus again would start up from the dead.<br/>Envy will Merit, as its shade, pursue,<br/>But like a shadow, proves the substance true;<br/>For envied wit, like Sol eclipsed, makes known<br/>The opposing body's grossness, not its own.<br/>When first that sun too powerful beams displays,<br/>It draws up vapours which obscure its rays;<br/>But even those clouds at last adorn its way,<br/>Reflect new glories, and augment the day.<br/><br/>Be thou the first true merit to befriend;<br/>His praise is lost, who stays till all commend.<br/>Short is the date, alas! of modern rhymes,<br/>And 'tis but just to let them live betimes.<br/>No longer now that golden age appears,<br/>When patriarch-wits survived a thousand years:<br/>Now length of fame (our second life) is lost,<br/>And bare threescore is all even that can boast;<br/>Our sons their fathers' failing language see,<br/>And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.<br/>So when the faithful pencil has design'd<br/>Some bright idea of the master's mind,<br/>Where a new world leaps out at his command,<br/>And ready Nature waits upon his hand;<br/>When the ripe colours soften and unite,<br/>And sweetly melt into just shade and light;<br/>When mellowing years their full perfection give,<br/>And each bold figure just begins to live,<br/>The treacherous colours the fair art betray,<br/>And all the bright creation fades away!<br/><br/>Unhappy wit, like most mistaken things,<br/>Atones not for that envy which it brings.<br/>In youth alone its empty praise we boast,<br/>But soon the short-lived vanity is lost:<br/>Like some fair flower the early spring supplies,<br/>That gaily blooms, but even in blooming dies.<br/>What is this wit, which must our cares employ?<br/>The owner's wife, that other men enjoy;<br/>Then most our trouble still when most admired,<br/>And still the more we give, the more required;<br/>Whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease,<br/>Sure some to vex, but never all to please;<br/>'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun,<br/>By fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone!<br/><br/>If wit so much from ignorance undergo,<br/>Ah, let not learning too commence its foe!<br/>Of old, those met rewards who could excel,<br/>And such were praised who but endeavour'd well:<br/>Though triumphs were to generals only due,<br/>Crowns were reserved to grace the soldiers too.<br/>Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown,<br/>Employ their pains to spurn some others down;<br/>And while self-love each jealous writer rules,<br/>Contending wits become the sport of fools:<br/>But still the worst with most regret commend,<br/>For each ill author is as bad a friend.<br/>To what base ends, and by what abject ways,<br/>Are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise!<br/>Ah, ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,<br/>Nor in the critic let the man be lost.<br/>Good-nature and good-sense must ever join;<br/>To err is human--to forgive, divine.<br/><br/>But if in noble minds some dregs remain,<br/>Not yet purged off, of spleen and sour disdain;<br/>Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes,<br/>Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.<br/>No pardon vile obscenity should find,<br/>Though wit and art conspire to move your mind;<br/>But dulness with obscenity must prove<br/>As shameful sure as impotence in love.<br/>In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,<br/>Sprung the rank weed, and thrived with large increase:<br/>When love was all an easy monarch's care;<br/>Seldom at council, never in a war:<br/>Jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ;<br/>Nay, wits had pensions, and young lords had wit;<br/>The fair sat panting at a courtier's play,<br/>And not a mask went unimproved away:<br/>The modest fan was lifted up no more,<br/>And virgins smiled at what they blush'd before.<br/>The following license of a foreign reign<br/>Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;<br/>Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,<br/>And taught more pleasant methods of salvation;<br/>Where Heaven's free subjects might their rights dispute,<br/>Lest God himself should seem too absolute:<br/>Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare,<br/>And vice admired to find a flatterer there!<br/>Encouraged thus, wit's Titans braved the skies,<br/>And the press groan'd with licensed blasphemies.<br/>These monsters, critics! with your darts engage,<br/>Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!<br/>Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice,<br/>Will needs mistake an author into vice;<br/>All seems infected that the infected spy,<br/>As all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye.<br/><br/>PART THIRD.<br/><br/>Learn, then, what MORALS critics ought to show,<br/>For 'tis but half a judge's task to know.<br/>'Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning join;<br/>In all you speak, let truth and candour shine:<br/>That not alone what to your sense is due<br/>All may allow; but seek your friendship too.<br/><br/>Be silent always when you doubt your sense;<br/>And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence:<br/>Some positive, persisting fops we know,<br/>Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so;<br/>But you, with pleasure own your errors past,<br/>And make each day a critique on the last.<br/><br/>'Tis not enough your counsel still be true;<br/>Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do;<br/>Men must be taught as if you taught them not,<br/>And things unknown proposed as things forgot.<br/>Without good-breeding, truth is disapproved;<br/>That only makes superior sense beloved.<br/><br/>Be niggards of advice on no pretence;<br/>For the worst avarice is that of sense.<br/>With mean complaisance ne'er betray your trust,<br/>Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.<br/>Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;<br/>Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.<br/><br/>'Twere well might critics still this freedom take,<br/>But Appius reddens at each word you speak,<br/>And stares tremendous, with a threatening eye,<br/>Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry.<br/>Fear most to tax an Honourable fool,<br/>Whose right it is, uncensured, to be dull;<br/>Such, without wit, are poets when they please,<br/>As without learning they can take degrees.<br/>Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires,<br/>And flattery to fulsome dedicators,<br/>Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,<br/>Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.<br/>'Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain,<br/>And charitably let the dull be vain:<br/>Your silence there is better than your spite,<br/>For who can rail so long as they can write?<br/>Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,<br/>And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.<br/>False steps but help them to renew the race,<br/>As, after stumbling, jades will mend their pace.<br/>What crowds of these, impenitently bold,<br/>In sounds and jingling syllables grown old,<br/>Still run on poets, in a raging vein,<br/>Even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain,<br/>Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,<br/>And rhyme with all the rage of impotence!<br/><br/>Such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis true,<br/>There are as mad, abandon'd critics too.<br/>The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,<br/>With loads of learn√®d lumber in his head,<br/>With his own tongue still edifies his ears,<br/>And always listening to himself appears.<br/>All books he reads, and all he reads assails,<br/>From Dryden's Fables down to D'Urfey's Tales.<br/>With him, most authors steal their works, or buy;<br/>Garth did not write his own Dispensary.<br/>Name a new play, and he's the poet's friend,<br/>Nay, show'd his faults--but when would poets mend?<br/>No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd,<br/>Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard:<br/>Nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you dead:<br/>For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.<br/>Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks,<br/>It still looks home, and short excursions makes;<br/>But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks,<br/>And, never shock'd, and never turn'd aside,<br/>Bursts out, resistless, with a thundering tide.<br/><br/>But where's the man, who counsel can bestow,<br/>Still pleased to teach, and yet not proud to know?<br/>Unbiass'd, or by favour, or by spite;<br/>Not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly right;<br/>Though learn'd, well-bred; and though well-bred, sincere;<br/>Modestly bold, and humanly severe:<br/>Who to a friend his faults can freely show,<br/>And gladly praise the merit of a foe?<br/>Bless'd with a taste exact, yet unconfined;<br/>A knowledge both of books and human kind;<br/>Generous converse; a soul exempt from pride;<br/>And love to praise, with reason on his side?<br/><br/>Such once were critics; such the happy few,<br/>Athens and Rome in better ages knew.<br/>The mighty Stagyrite first left the shore,<br/>Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore;<br/>He steer'd securely, and discover'd far,<br/>Led by the light of the Maeonian star.<br/>Poets, a race long unconfined, and free,<br/>Still fond and proud of savage liberty,<br/>Received his laws; and stood convinced 'twas fit,<br/>Who conquer'd Nature, should preside o'er Wit.<br/><br/>Horace still charms with graceful negligence,<br/>And without method talks us into sense,<br/>Will, like a friend, familiarly convey<br/>The truest notions in the easiest way.<br/>He who, supreme in judgment, as in wit,<br/>Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ,<br/>Yet judged with coolness, though he sung with fire;<br/>His precepts teach but what his works inspire.<br/>Our critics take a contrary extreme,<br/>They judge with fury, but they write with phlegm:<br/>Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations<br/>By wits, than critics in as wrong quotations.<br/><br/>See Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine,<br/>And call new beauties forth from every line!<br/><br/>Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,<br/>The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.<br/><br/>In grave Quintilian's copious work we find<br/>The justest rules and clearest method join'd:<br/>Thus useful arms in magazines we place,<br/>All ranged in order, and disposed with grace,<br/>But less to please the eye, than arm the hand,<br/>Still fit for use, and ready at command.<br/><br/>Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,<br/>And bless their critic with a poet's fire.<br/>An ardent judge, who, zealous in his trust,<br/>With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;<br/>Whose own example strengthens all his laws;<br/>And is himself that Great Sublime he draws.<br/><br/>Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd,<br/>Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd.<br/>Learning and Rome alike in empire grew;<br/>And arts still follow'd where her eagles flew;<br/>From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom,<br/>And the same age saw Learning fall, and Rome.<br/>With Tyranny then Superstition join'd,<br/>As that the body, this enslaved the mind;<br/>Much was believed, but little understood,<br/>And to be dull was construed to be good;<br/>A second deluge Learning thus o'errun,<br/>And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun.<br/><br/>At length Erasmus, that great injured name,<br/>(The glory of the priesthood, and the shame!)<br/>Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barbarous age,<br/>And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.<br/><br/>But see! each Muse, in Leo's golden days,<br/>Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays,<br/>Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread,<br/>Shakes off the dust, and rears his reverend head.<br/>Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive;<br/>Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;<br/>With sweeter notes each rising temple rung:<br/>A Raphael painted, and a Vida sung:<br/>Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow<br/>The poet's bays and critic's ivy grow;<br/>Cremona now shall ever boast thy name,<br/>As next in place to Mantua, next in fame!<br/><br/>But soon by impious arms from Latium chased,<br/>Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd;<br/>Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance,<br/>But critic-learning flourish'd most in France:<br/>The rules a nation, born to serve, obeys;<br/>And Boileau still in right of Horace sways.<br/>But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despised,<br/>And kept unconquer'd and uncivilised;<br/>Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,<br/>We still defied the Romans, as of old.<br/>Yet some there were, among the sounder few<br/>Of those who less presumed, and better knew,<br/>Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,<br/>And here restored Wit's fundamental laws.<br/>Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell,<br/>'Nature's chief masterpiece is writing well.'<br/>Such was Roscommon, not more learn'd than good,<br/>With manners generous as his noble blood;<br/>To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,<br/>And every author's merit, but his own.<br/>Such late was Walsh--the Muse's judge and friend,<br/>Who justly knew to blame or to commend;<br/>To failings mild, but zealous for desert;<br/>The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.<br/>This humble praise, lamented Shade! receive,<br/>This praise at least a grateful Muse may give:<br/>The Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,<br/>Prescribed her heights, and pruned her tender wing,<br/>(Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise,<br/>But in low numbers short excursions tries:<br/>Content, if hence the unlearn'd their wants may view,<br/>The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:<br/>Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame;<br/>Still pleased to praise, yet not afraid to blame;<br/>Averse alike to flatter, or offend;<br/>Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.
