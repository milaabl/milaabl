# üíÆ The Italian in England by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    That second time they hunted me<br/>From hill to plain, from shore to sea,<br/>And Austria, hounding far and wide<br/>Her blood-hounds thro' the country-side,<br/>Breathed hot an instant on my trace,--<br/>I made, six days, a hiding-place<br/>Of that dry green old aqueduct<br/>Where I and Charles, when boys, have plucked<br/>The fire-flies from the roof above,<br/>Bright creeping thro' the moss they love:<br/>--How long it seems since Charles was lost!<br/>Six days the soldiers crossed, and crossed<br/>The country in my very sight;<br/>And when that peril ceased at night,<br/>The sky broke out in red dismay<br/>With signal-fires. Well, there I lay<br/>Close covered o'er in my recess,<br/>Up to the neck in ferns and cress.<br/>Thinking on Metternich, our friend,<br/>And Charles's miserable end,<br/>And much beside, two days; the third,<br/>Hunger o'ercame me when I heard<br/>The peasants from the village go<br/>To work among the maize: you know,<br/>With us in Lombardy, they bring<br/>Provisions packed on mules, a string,<br/>With little bells that cheer their task,<br/>And casks, and boughs on every cask<br/>To keep the sun's heat from the wine;<br/>These I let pass in jingling line;<br/>And, close on them, dear noisy crew,<br/>The peasants from the village, too;<br/>For at the very rear would troop<br/>Their wives and sisters in a group<br/>To help, I knew. When these had passed,<br/>I threw my glove to strike the last,<br/>Taking the chance: she did not start,<br/>Much less cry out, but stooped apart,<br/>One instant rapidly glanced round,<br/>And saw me beckon from the ground.<br/>A wild bush grows and hides my crypt;<br/>She picked my glove up while she stripped<br/>A branch off, then rejoined the rest<br/>With that; my glove lay in her breast:<br/>Then I drew breath; they disappeared:<br/>It was for Italy I feared.<br/><br/>  An hour, and she returned alone<br/>Exactly where my glove was thrown.<br/>Meanwhile came many thoughts: on me<br/>Rested the hopes of Italy.<br/>I had devised a certain tale<br/>Which, when 'twas told her, could not fail<br/>Persuade a peasant of its truth;<br/>I meant to call a freak of youth<br/>This hiding, and give hopes of pay,<br/>And no temptation to betray.<br/>But when I saw that woman's face,<br/>Its calm simplicity of grace,<br/>Our Italy's own attitude<br/>In which she walked thus far, and stood,<br/>Planting each naked foot so firm,<br/>To crush the snake and spare the worm--<br/>At first sight of her eyes, I said,<br/>"I am that man upon whose head<br/>They fix the price, because I hate<br/>The Austrians over us; the State<br/>Will give you gold--oh, gold so much!--<br/>If you betray me to their clutch.<br/>And be your death, for aught I know,<br/>If once they find you saved their foe.<br/>Now, you must bring me food and drink,<br/>And also paper, pen and ink,<br/>And carry safe what I shall write<br/>To Padua, which you'll reach at night<br/>Before the duomo shuts; go in,<br/>And wait till Tenebrae begin;<br/>Walk to the third confessional,<br/>Between the pillar and the wall,<br/>And kneeling whisper,Whence comes peace?_<br/>Say it a second time, then cease;<br/>And if the voice inside returns,<br/>_From Christ and Freedom; what concerns<br/>The cause of Peace?_--for answer, slip<br/>My letter where you placed your lip;<br/>Then come back happy we have done<br/>Our mother service--I, the son,<br/>As you the daughter of our land!"<br/><br/>  Three mornings more, she took her stand<br/>In the same place, with the same eyes:<br/>I was no surer of sun-rise<br/>Than of her coming. We conferred<br/>Of her own prospects, and I heard<br/>She had a lover--stout and tall,<br/>She said--then let her eyelids fall,<br/>"He could do much"--as if some doubt<br/>Entered her heart,--then, passing out,<br/>"She could not speak for others, who<br/>Had other thoughts; herself she knew;"<br/>And so she brought me drink and food.<br/>After four days, the scouts pursued<br/>Another path; at last arrived<br/>The help my Paduan friends contrived<br/>To furnish me: she brought the news.<br/>For the first time I could not choose<br/>But kiss her hand, and lay my own<br/>Upon her head--"This faith was shown<br/>To Italy, our mother; she<br/>Uses my hand and blesses thee."<br/>She followed down to the sea-shore;<br/>I left and never saw her more.<br/><br/>  How very long since I have thought<br/>Concerning--much less wished for--aught<br/>Beside the good of Italy,<br/>For which I live and mean to die!<br/>I never was in love; and since<br/>Charles proved false, what shall now convince<br/>My inmost heart I have a friend?<br/>However, if I pleased to spend<br/>Real wishes on myself--say, three--<br/>I know at least what one should be.<br/>I would grasp Metternich until<br/>I felt his red wet throat distil<br/>In blood thro' these two hands. And next,<br/>--Nor much for that am I perplexed--<br/>Charles, perjured traitor, for his part,<br/>Should die slow of a broken heart<br/>Under his new employers. Last<br/>--Ah, there, what should I wish? For fast<br/>Do I grow old and out of strength.<br/>If I resolved to seek at length<br/>My father's house again, how scared<br/>They all would look, and unprepared!<br/>My brothers live in Austria's pay<br/>--Disowned me long ago, men say;<br/>And all my early mates who used<br/>To praise me so--perhaps induced<br/>More than one early step of mine--<br/>Are turning wise: while some opine<br/>"Freedom grows license," some suspect<br/>"Haste breeds delay," and recollect<br/>They always said, such premature<br/>Beginnings never could endure!<br/>So, with a sullen "All's for best,"<br/>The land seems settling to its rest.<br/>I think then, I should wish to stand<br/>This evening in that dear, lost land,<br/>Over the sea the thousand miles,<br/>And know if yet that woman smiles<br/>With the calm smile; some little farm<br/>She lives in there, no doubt: what harm<br/>If I sat on the door-side bench,<br/>And while her spindle made a trench<br/>Fantastically in the dust,<br/>Inquired of all her fortunes--just<br/>Her children's ages and their names,<br/>And what may be the husband's aims<br/>For each of them. I'd talk this out,<br/>And sit there, for an hour about,<br/>Then kiss her hand once more, and lay<br/>Mine on her head, and go my way.<br/><br/>  So much for idle wishing--how<br/>It steals the time! To business now.
