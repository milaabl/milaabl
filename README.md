# üíÆ Lucretius by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Lucilla, wedded to Lucretius, found<br/>Her master cold; for when the morning flush<br/>Of passion and the first embrace had died<br/>Between them, tho' he loved her none the less,<br/>Yet often when the woman heard his foot<br/>Return from pacings in the field, and ran<br/>To greet him with a kiss, the master took<br/>Small notice, or austerely, for his mind<br/>Half buried in some weightier argument,<br/>Or fancy-borne perhaps upon the rise<br/>And long roll of the hexameter -- he past<br/>To turn and ponder those three hundred scrolls<br/>Left by the Teacher, whom he held divine.<br/>She brook'd it not, but wrathful, petulant<br/>Dreaming some rival, sought and found a witch<br/>Who brew'd the philtre which had power, they said<br/>To lead an errant passion home again.<br/>And this, at times, she mingled with his drink,<br/>And this destroy'd him; for the wicked broth<br/>Confused the chemic labor of the blood,<br/>And tickling the brute brain within the man's<br/>Made havoc among those tender cells, and check'd<br/>His power to shape. He loathed himself, and once<br/>After a tempest woke upon a morn<br/>That mock'd him with returning calm, and cried:<br/><br/>"Storm in the night! for thrice I heard the rain<br/>Rushing; and once the flash of a thunderbolt --<br/>Methought I never saw so fierce a fork --<br/>Struck out the streaming mountain-side, and show'd<br/>A riotous confluence of watercourses<br/>Blanching and billowing in a hollow of it,<br/>Where all but yester-eve was dusty-dry.<br/><br/>"Storm, and what dreams, ye holy Gods, what dreams!<br/>For thrice I waken'd after dreams. Perchance<br/>We do but recollect the dreams that come<br/>Just ere the waking. Terrible: for it seem'd<br/>A void was made in Nature, all her bonds<br/>Crack'd; and I saw the flaring atom-streams<br/>And torrents of her myriad universe,<br/>Ruining along the illimitable inane,<br/>Fly on to clash together again, and make<br/>Another and another frame of things<br/>For ever. That was mine, my dream, I knew it --<br/>Of and belonging to me, as the dog<br/>With inward yelp and restless forefoot plies<br/>His function of the woodland; but the next!<br/>I thought that all the blood by Sylla shed<br/>Came driving rainlike down again on earth,<br/>And where it dash'd the reddening meadow, sprang<br/>No dragon warriors from Cadmean teeth,<br/>For these I thought my dream would show to me,<br/>But girls, Hetairai, curious in their art,<br/>Hired animalisms, vile as those that made<br/>The mulberry-faced Dictator's orgies worse<br/>Than aught they fable of the quiet Gods.<br/>And hands they mixt, and yell'd and round me drove<br/>In narrowing circles till I yell'd again<br/>Half-suffocated, and sprang up, and saw --<br/>Was it the first beam of my latest day?<br/><br/>"Then, then, from utter gloom stood out the<br/>The breasts of Helen, and hoveringly a sword<br/>Now over and now under, now direct,<br/>Pointed itself to pierce, but sank down shamed<br/>At all that beauty; and as I stared, a fire,<br/>The fire that left a roofless Ilion,<br/>Shot out of them, and scorch'd me that I woke.<br/><br/>"Is this thy vengeance, holy Venus, thine,<br/>Because I would not one of thine own doves,<br/>Not even a rose, were offered to thee? thine,<br/>Forgetful how my rich proemion makes<br/>Thy glory fly along the Italian field,<br/>In lays that will outlast thy deity?<br/><br/>"Deity? nay, thy worshippers. My tongue<br/>Trips, or I speak profanely. Which of these<br/>Angers thee most, or angers thee at all?<br/>Not if thou be'st of those who, far aloof<br/>From envy, hate and pity, and spite and scorn,<br/>Live the great life which all our greatest fain<br/>Would follow, centred in eternal calm.<br/><br/>"Nay, if thou canst,<br/>Goddess, like ourselves<br/>Touch, and be touch'd, then would I cry to thee<br/>To kiss thy Mavors, roll thy tender arms<br/>Round him, and keep him from the lust of blood<br/>That makes a steaming slaughter-house of Rome.<br/><br/>"Ay, but I meant not thee; I meant riot her<br/>Whom all the pines of Ida shook to see<br/>Slide from that quiet heaven of hers, and tempt<br/>The Trojan, while his neatherds were abroad<br/>Nor her that o'er her wounded hunter wept<br/>Her deity false in human-amorous tears;<br/>Nor whom her beardless apple-arbiter<br/>Decided fairest. Rather, O ye Gods,<br/>Poet-like, as the great Sicilian called<br/>Calliope to grace his golden verse --<br/>Ay, and this Kypris also -- did I take<br/>That popular name of thine to shadow forth<br/>The all-generating powers and genial heat<br/>Of Nature, when she strikes thro' the thick blood<br/>Of cattle, and light is large, and lambs are glad<br/>Nosing the mother's udder, and the bird<br/>Makes his heart voice amid the blaze of flowers;<br/>Which things appear the work of mighty Gods.<br/><br/>"The Gods! and if I go my work is left<br/>Unfinish'd -- if I go. The Gods, who haunt<br/>The lucid interspace of world and world,<br/>Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,<br/>Nor ever falls the least white star of mow<br/>Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,<br/>Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar<br/>Their sacred everlasting calm! and such,<br/>Not all so fine, nor so divine a calm<br/>Not such, nor all unlike it, man may gain<br/>Letting his own life go. The Gods, the Godsl<br/>If all be atoms, how then should the Gods<br/>Being atomic not be dissoluble,<br/>Not follow the great law? My master held<br/>That Gods there are, for all men so believe.<br/>I prest my footsteps into his, and meant<br/>Surely to lead my Memmius in a train<br/>Of fiowery clauses onward to the proof<br/>That Gods there are, and deathless. Meant? I meant?<br/>I have forgotten what I meant, my mind<br/>Stumbles, and all my faculties are lamed.<br/><br/>"Look where another of our Gods, the Sun<br/>Apollo, Delius, or of older use<br/>All-seeing Hyperion -- what you will --<br/>Has mounted yonder; since he never sware,<br/>Except his wrath were wreak'd on wretched man,<br/>That he would only shine among the dead<br/>Hereafter -- tales! for never yet on earth<br/>Could dead flesh creep, or bits of roasting ox<br/>Moan round the spit -- nor knows he what he sees;<br/>King of the East altho' he seem, and girt<br/>With song and flame and fragrance, slowly lifts<br/>His golden feet on those empurpled stairs<br/>That climb into the windy halls of heaven<br/>And here he glances on an eye new-born,<br/>And gets for greeting but a wail of pain;<br/>And here he stays upon a freezing orb<br/>That fain would gaze upon him to the last;<br/>And here upon a yellow eyelid fallen<br/>And closed by those who mourn a friend in vain,<br/>Not thankful that his troubles are no more.<br/>And me, altho' his fire is on my face<br/>Blinding, he sees not, nor at all can tell<br/>Whether I mean this day to end myself.<br/>Or lend an ear to Plato where he says,<br/>That men like soldiers may not quit the post<br/>Allotted by the Gods. But he that holds<br/>The Gods are careless, wherefore need he care<br/>Greatly for them, nor rather plunge at once,<br/>Being troubled, wholly out of sight, and sink<br/>Past earthquake -- ay, and gout and stone, that break<br/>Body toward death, and palsy, death-in-life,<br/>And wretched age -- and worst disease of all,<br/>These prodigies of myriad nakednesses,<br/>And twisted shapes of lust, unspeakable,<br/>Abominable, strangers at my hearth<br/>Not welcome, harpies miring every dish,<br/>The phantom husks of something foully done,<br/>And fleeting thro' the boundless universe,<br/>And blasting the long quiet of my breast<br/>With animal heat and dire insanity?<br/><br/>"How should the mind, except it loved them, clasp<br/>These idols to herself? or do they fly<br/>Now thinner, and now thicker, like the flakes<br/>In a fall of snow, and so press in, perforce<br/>Of multitude, as crowds that in an hour<br/>Of civic tumult jam the doors, and bear<br/>The keepers down, and throng, their rags and the<br/>The basest, far into that council-hall<br/>Where sit the best and stateliest of the land?<br/><br/>¬≥Can I not fling this horror off me again,<br/>Seeing with how great ease Nature can smile<br/>Balmier and nobler from her bath of storm,<br/>At random ravage? and how easily<br/>The mountain there has cast his cloudy slough,<br/>Now towering o'er him in serenest air,<br/>A mountain o'er a mountain, -- ay, and within<br/>All hollow as the hopes and fears of men?<br/><br/>"But who was he that in the garden snared<br/>Picus and Faunus, rustic Gods? a tale<br/>To laugh at -- more to laugh at in myself --<br/>For look! what is it? there? yon arbutus<br/>Totters; a noiseless riot underneath<br/>Strikes through the wood, sets all the tops quivering -- ;<br/>The mountain quickens into Nymph and Faun,<br/>And here an Oread -- how the sun delights<br/>To glance and shift about her slippery sides,<br/>And rosy knees and supple roundedness,<br/>And budded bosom-peaks -- who this way runs<br/>Before the rest! -- a satyr, a satyr, see,<br/>Follows; but him I proved impossible<br/>Twy-natured is no nature. Yet he draws<br/>Nearer and nearer, and I scan him now<br/>Beastlier than any phantom of his kind<br/>That ever butted his rough brother-brute<br/>For lust or lusty blood or provender.<br/>I hate, abhor, spit, sicken at him; and she<br/>Loathes him as well; such a precipitate heel,<br/>Fledged as it were with Mercury's ankle-wing,<br/>Whirls her to me -- ;but will she fling herself<br/>Shameless upon me? Catch her, goatfoot! nay,<br/>Hide, hide them, million-myrtled wilderness,<br/><br/>And cavern-shadowing laurels, hide! do I wish --<br/>What? -- ;that the bush were leafless? or to whelm<br/>All of them in one massacre? O ye Gods<br/>I know you careless, yet, behold, to you<br/>From childly wont and ancient use I call --<br/>I thought I lived securely as yourselves --<br/>No lewdness, narrowing envy, monkey-spite,<br/>No madness of ambition, avarice, none;<br/>No larger feast than under plane or pine<br/>With neighbors laid along the grass, to take<br/>Only such cups as left us friendly-warm,<br/>Affirming each his own philosophy<br/>Nothing to mar the sober majesties<br/>Of settled, sweet, Epicurean life.<br/>But now it seems some unseen monster lays<br/>His vast and filthy hands upon my will,<br/>Wrenching it backward into his, and spoils<br/>My bliss in being; and it was not great,<br/>For save when shutting reasons up in rhythm,<br/>Or Heliconian honey in living words,<br/>To make a truth less harsh, I often grew<br/>Tired of so much within our little life<br/>Or of so little in our little life --<br/>Poor little life that toddles half an hour<br/>Crown'd with a flower or two, and there an end --<br/>And since the nobler pleasure seems to fade,<br/>Why should I, beastlike as I find myself,<br/>Not manlike end myself? -- our privilege -- ;<br/>What beast has heart to do it? And what man<br/>What Roman would be dragg'd in triumph thus?<br/>Not I; not he, who bears one name with her<br/>Whose death-blow struck the dateless doom of kings,<br/>When, brooking not the Tarquin in her veins,<br/>She made her blood in sight of Collatine<br/>And all his peers, flushing the guiltless air,<br/>Spout from the maiden fountain in her heart.<br/>And from it sprang the Commonwealth, which breaks<br/>As I am breaking now!<br/><br/>"And therefore now<br/>Let her, that is the womb and tomb of all<br/>Great Nature, take, and forcing far apart<br/>Those blind beginnings that have made me man,<br/>Dash them anew together at her will<br/>Thro' all her cycles -- into man once more,<br/>Or beast or bird or fish, or opulent flower.<br/>But till this cosmic order everywhere<br/>Shatter'd into one earthquake m one day<br/>Cracks all to pieces, -- and that hour perhaps<br/>Is not so far when momentary man<br/>Shall seem no more a something to himself,<br/>But he, his hopes and hates, his homes and fanes<br/>And even his bones long laid within the grave,<br/>The very sides of the grave itself shall pass,<br/>Vanishing, atom and void, atom and void,<br/>Into the unseen for ever, -- till that hour,<br/>My golden work in which I told a truth<br/>That stays the rolling Ixionian wheel,<br/>And numbs the Fury's ringlet-snake, and plucks<br/>The mortal soul from out immortal hell<br/>Shall stand. Ay, surely; then it fails at last<br/>And perishes as I must, for O Thou<br/>Passionless bride, divine Tranquillity,<br/>Yearn'd after by the wisest of the wise<br/>Who fail to find thee, being as thou art<br/>Without one pleasure and without one pain,<br/>Howbeit I know thou surely must be mine<br/>Or soon or late, yet out of season, thus<br/>I woo thee roughly, for thou carest not<br/>How roughly men may woo thee so they win -- ;<br/>Thus -- thus -- the soul flies out and dies in the air<br/><br/>With that he drove the knife into his side.<br/>She heard him raging, heard him fall, ran in,<br/>Beat breast, tore hair, cried out upon herself<br/>As having fail'd in duty to him, shriek'd<br/>That she but meant to win him back, fell on him<br/>Clasp'd, kiss'd him, wail'd. He answer'd, "Care not thou!<br/>Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well!"
