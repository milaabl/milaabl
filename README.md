# üíÆ Hymn to Intellectual Beauty by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    The awful shadow of some unseen Power<br/>Floats though unseen among us,--visiting<br/>This various world with as inconstant wing<br/>As summer winds that creep from flower to flower,--<br/>Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower,<br/>It visits with inconstant glance<br/>Each human heart and countenance;<br/>Like hues and harmonies of evening,--<br/>Like clouds in starlight widely spread,--<br/>Like memory of music fled,--<br/>Like aught that for its grace may be<br/>Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.<br/><br/>Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost consecrate<br/>With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon<br/>Of human thought or form,--where art thou gone?<br/>Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,<br/>This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?<br/>Ask why the sunlight not for ever<br/>Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river,<br/>Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,<br/>Why fear and dream and death and birth<br/>Cast on the daylight of this earth<br/>Such gloom,--why man has such a scope<br/>For love and hate, despondency and hope?<br/><br/>No voice from some sublimer world hath ever<br/>To sage or poet these responses given--<br/>Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven.<br/>Remain the records of their vain endeavour,<br/>Frail spells--whose uttered charm might not avail to sever,<br/>From all we hear and all we see,<br/>Doubt, chance, and mutability.<br/>Thy light alone--like mist o'er mountains driven,<br/>Or music by the night-wind sent<br/>Through strings of some still instrument,<br/>Or moonlight on a midnight stream,<br/>Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream.<br/><br/>Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart<br/>And come, for some uncertain moments lent.<br/>Man were immortal, and omnipotent,<br/>Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art,<br/>Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart.<br/>Thou messenger of sympathies,<br/>That wax and wane in lovers' eyes--<br/>Thou--that to human thought art nourishment,<br/>Like darkness to a dying flame!<br/>Depart not as thy shadow came<br/>Depart not--lest the grave should be,<br/>Like life and fear, a dark reality.<br/><br/>While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped<br/>Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,<br/>And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing<br/>Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.<br/>I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed;<br/>I was not heard--I saw them not--<br/>When musing deeply on the lot<br/>Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing<br/>All vital things that wake to bring<br/>News of birds and blossoming,--<br/>Sudden, thy shadow fell on me;<br/>I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy!<br/><br/>I vowed that I would dedicate my powers<br/>To thee and thine--have I not kept the vow?<br/>With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now<br/>I call the phantoms of a thousand hours<br/>Each from his voiceless grave: they have in visioned bowers<br/>Of studious zeal or love's delight<br/>Outwatched with me the envious night--<br/>They know that never joy illumed my brow<br/>Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free<br/>This world from its dark slavery,<br/>That thou--O awful LOVELINESS,<br/>Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express.<br/><br/>The day becomes more solemn and serene<br/>When noon is past--there is a harmony<br/>In autumn, and a lustre in its sky,<br/>Which through the summer is not heard or seen,<br/>As if it could not be, as if it had not been!<br/>Thus let thy power, which like the truth<br/>Of nature on my passive youth<br/>Descended, to my onward life supply<br/>Its calm--to one who worships thee,<br/>And every form containing thee,<br/>Whom, SPIRIT fair, thy spells did bind<br/>To fear himself, and love all human kind.
