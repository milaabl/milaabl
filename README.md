# üíÆ Windsor-Forest. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GEORGE LORD LANSDOWNE.<br/><br/>'Non injussa cano: te nostrae, Vare, myricae,<br/>Te nemus omne canet; nee Phoebo gratior ulla est,<br/>Quam sibi quae Vari praescripsit pagina nomen.'<br/><br/>VIRG.<br/><br/>Thy forests, Windsor! and thy green retreats,<br/>At once the Monarch's and the Muse's seats,<br/>Invite my lays. Be present, sylvan Maids!<br/>Unlock your springs, and open all your shades.<br/>Granville commands; your aid, O Muses, bring!<br/>What Muse for Granville can refuse to sing?<br/><br/>The groves of Eden, vanish'd now so long,<br/>Live in description, and look green in song:<br/>These, were my breast inspired with equal flame,<br/>Like them in beauty, should be like in fame.<br/>Here hills and vales, the woodland and the plain,<br/>Here earth and water seem to strive again;<br/>Not chaos-like, together crush'd and bruised,<br/>But, as the world, harmoniously confused;<br/>Where order in variety we see,<br/>And where, though all things differ, all agree.<br/>Here waving groves a chequer'd scene display,<br/>And part admit, and part exclude the day;<br/>As some coy nymph her lover's warm address<br/>Nor quite indulges, nor can quite repress.<br/>There, interspersed in lawns and opening glades,<br/>Thin trees arise that shun each other's shades.<br/>Here in full light the russet plains extend:<br/>There, wrapt in clouds the bluish hills ascend.<br/>Ev'n the wild heath displays her purple dyes,<br/>And 'midst the desert fruitful fields arise,<br/>That crown'd with tufted trees and springing corn,<br/>Like verdant isles the sable waste adorn.<br/>Let India boast her plants, nor envy we<br/>The weeping amber or the balmy tree,<br/>While by our oaks the precious loads are born,<br/>And realms commanded which those trees adorn.<br/>Not proud Olympus yields a nobler sight,<br/>Though gods assembled grace his towering height.<br/>Than what more humble mountains offer here,<br/>Where, in their blessings, all those gods appear.<br/>See Pan with flocks, with fruits Pomona crown'd,<br/>Here blushing Flora paints the enamell'd ground,<br/>Here Ceres' gifts in waving prospect stand,<br/>And nodding tempt the joyful reaper's hand;<br/>Rich industry sits smiling on the plains,<br/>And peace and plenty tell a Stuart reigns.<br/><br/>Not thus the land appear'd in ages past,<br/>A dreary desert, and a gloomy waste,<br/>To savage beasts and savage laws a prey,<br/>And kings more furious and severe than they;<br/>Who claim'd the skies, dispeopled air and floods,<br/>The lonely lords of empty wilds and woods:<br/>Cities laid waste, they storm'd the dens and caves,<br/>(For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves).<br/>What could be free, when lawless beasts obey'd,<br/>And even the elements a tyrant sway'd?<br/>In vain kind seasons swell'd the teeming grain,<br/>Soft showers distill'd, and suns grew warm in vain;<br/>The swain with tears his frustrate labour yields,<br/>And famish'd dies amidst his ripen'd fields.<br/>What wonder, then, a beast or subject slain<br/>Were equal crimes in a despotic reign?<br/>Both doom'd alike, for sportive tyrants bled,<br/>But while the subject starved, the beast was fed.<br/>Proud Nimrod first the bloody chase began,<br/>A mighty hunter, and his prey was man:<br/>Our haughty Norman boasts that barbarous name,<br/>And makes his trembling slaves the royal game.<br/>The fields are ravish'd from the industrious swains,<br/>From men their cities, and from gods their fanes:<br/>The levell'd towns with weeds lie cover'd o'er;<br/>The hollow winds through naked temples roar;<br/>Round broken columns clasping ivy twined;<br/>O'er heaps of ruin stalk'd the stately hind;<br/>The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires,<br/>And savage howlings fill the sacred choirs.<br/>Awed by his Nobles, by his Commons cursed,<br/>The oppressor ruled tyrannic where he durst,<br/>Stretch'd o'er the poor and Church his iron rod,<br/>And served alike his vassals and his God.<br/>Whom even the Saxon spared, and bloody Dane,<br/>The wanton victims of his sport remain.<br/>But see, the man who spacious regions gave<br/>A waste for beasts, himself denied a grave!<br/>Stretch'd on the lawn, his second hope survey,<br/>At once the chaser, and at once the prey:<br/>Lo Rufus, tugging at the deadly dart,<br/>Bleeds in the forest like a wounded hart.<br/>Succeeding monarchs heard the subjects' cries,<br/>Nor saw displeased the peaceful cottage rise.<br/>Then gathering flocks on unknown mountains fed,<br/>O'er sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread,<br/>The forests wonder'd at the unusual grain,<br/>And secret transport touch'd the conscious swain.<br/>Fair Liberty, Britannia's goddess, rears<br/>Her cheerful head, and leads the golden years.<br/><br/>Ye vigorous swains! while youth ferments your blood,<br/>And purer spirits swell the sprightly flood,<br/>Now range the hills, the gameful woods beset,<br/>Wind the shrill horn, or spread the waving net.<br/>When milder autumn summer's heat succeeds,<br/>And in the new-shorn field the partridge feeds,<br/>Before his lord the ready spaniel bounds,<br/>Panting with hope, he tries the furrow'd grounds;<br/>But when the tainted gales the game betray,<br/>Couch'd close he lies, and meditates the prey:<br/>Secure they trust the unfaithful field beset,<br/>Till hovering o'er 'em sweeps the swelling net.<br/>Thus (if small things we may with great compare)<br/>When Albion sends her eager sons to war,<br/>Some thoughtless town, with ease and plenty blest,<br/>Near, and more near, the closing lines invest;<br/>Sudden they seize the amazed, defenceless prize,<br/>And high in air Britannia's standard flies.<br/><br/>See! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs,<br/>And mounts exulting on triumphant wings:<br/>Short is his joy; he feels the fiery wound,<br/>Flutters in blood, and panting beats the ground.<br/>Ah! what avail his glossy, varying dyes,<br/>His purple crest, and scarlet-circled eyes,<br/>The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,<br/>His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold?<br/><br/>Nor yet, when moist Arcturus clouds the sky,<br/>The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny.<br/>To plains with well-breath'd beagles we repair,<br/>And trace the mazes of the circling hare;<br/>(Beasts, urged by us, their fellow-beasts pursue,<br/>And learn of man each other to undo.)<br/>With slaughtering gun the unwearied fowler roves,<br/>When frosts have whiten'd all the naked groves;<br/>Where doves in flocks the leafless trees o'ershade,<br/>And lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade.<br/>He lifts the tube, and levels with his eye;<br/>Straight a short thunder breaks the frozen sky;<br/>Oft, as in airy rings they skim the heath,<br/>The clamorous lapwings feel the leaden death:<br/>Oft, as the mounting larks their notes prepare,<br/>They fall, and leave their little lives in air.<br/><br/>In genial spring, beneath the quivering shade,<br/>Where cooling vapours breathe along the mead,<br/>The patient fisher takes his silent stand,<br/>Intent, his angle trembling in his hand:<br/>With looks unmoved, he hopes the scaly breed,<br/>And eyes the dancing cork, and bending reed.<br/>Our plenteous streams a various race supply,<br/>The bright-eyed perch with fins of Tyrian dye,<br/>The silver eel, in shining volumes roll'd,<br/>The yellow carp, in scales bedropp'd with gold,<br/>Swift trouts, diversified with crimson stains,<br/>And pikes, the tyrants of the watery plains.<br/><br/>Now Cancer glows with Phoebus' fiery car:<br/>The youth rush eager to the sylvan war,<br/>Swarm o'er the lawns, the forest walks surround,<br/>Rouse the fleet hart, and cheer the opening hound.<br/>The impatient courser pants in every vein,<br/>And pawing, seems to beat the distant plain:<br/>Hills, vales, and floods appear already cross'd,<br/>And ere he starts, a thousand steps are lost.<br/>See the bold youth strain up the threatening steep,<br/>Rush through the thickets, down the valleys sweep,<br/>Hang o'er their coursers' heads with eager speed,<br/>And earth rolls back beneath the flying steed.<br/>Let old Arcadia boast her ample plain,<br/>The immortal huntress, and her virgin-train;<br/>Nor envy, Windsor! since thy shades have seen<br/>As bright a goddess, and as chaste a queen,<br/>Whose care, like hers, protects the sylvan reign,<br/>The earth's fair light, and empress of the main.<br/><br/>Here too, 'tis sung, of old Diana stray'd,<br/>And Cynthus' top forsook for Windsor shade;<br/>Here was she seen o'er airy wastes to rove,<br/>Seek the clear spring, or haunt the pathless grove;<br/>Here, arm'd with silver bows, in early dawn,<br/>Her buskin'd virgins traced the dewy lawn.<br/><br/>Above the rest a rural nymph was famed,<br/>Thy offspring, Thames! the fair Lodona named;<br/>(Lodona's fate, in long oblivion cast,<br/>The Muse shall sing, and what she sings shall last).<br/>Scarce could the goddess from her nymph be known,<br/>But by the crescent and the golden zone.<br/>She scorn'd the praise of beauty, and the care;<br/>A belt her waist, a fillet binds her hair;<br/>A painted quiver on her shoulder sounds,<br/>And with her dart the flying deer she wounds.<br/>It chanced, as eager of the chase, the maid<br/>Beyond the forest's verdant limits stray'd,<br/>Pan saw and loved, and, burning with desire,<br/>Pursued her flight, her flight increased his fire.<br/>Not half so swift the trembling doves can fly,<br/>When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky;<br/>Not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves,<br/>When through the clouds he drives the trembling doves;<br/>As from the god she flew with furious pace,<br/>Or as the god, more furious, urged the chase.<br/>Now fainting, sinking, pale the nymph appears;<br/>Now close behind, his sounding steps she hears;<br/>And now his shadow reach'd her as she run,<br/>His shadow lengthen'd by the setting sun;<br/>And now his shorter breath, with sultry air,<br/>Pants on her neck, and fans her parting hair.<br/>In vain on father Thames she calls for aid,<br/>Nor could Diana help her injured maid.<br/>Faint, breathless, thus she pray'd, nor pray'd in vain:<br/>'Ah, Cynthia! ah--though banish'd from thy train,<br/>Let me, oh! let me, to the shades repair,<br/>My native shades--there weep, and murmur there.'<br/>She said, and melting as in tears she lay,<br/>In a soft, silver stream dissolved away.<br/>The silver stream her virgin coldness keeps,<br/>For ever murmurs, and for ever weeps;<br/>Still bears the name the hapless virgin bore,<br/>And bathes the forest where she ranged before.<br/>In her chaste current oft the goddess laves,<br/>And with celestial tears augments the waves.<br/>Oft in her glass the musing shepherd spies<br/>The headlong mountains and the downward skies,<br/>The watery landscape of the pendent woods,<br/>And absent trees that tremble in the floods;<br/>In the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen,<br/>And floating forests paint the waves with green,<br/>Through the fair scene roll slow the lingering streams,<br/>Then foaming pour along, and rush into the Thames.<br/><br/>Thou, too, great Father of the British floods!<br/>With joyful pride survey'st our lofty woods;<br/>Where towering oaks their growing honours rear,<br/>And future navies on thy shores appear.<br/>Not Neptune's self from all her streams receives<br/>A wealthier tribute, than to thine he gives.<br/>No seas so rich, so gay no banks appear,<br/>No lake so gentle, and no spring so clear.<br/>Nor Po so swells the fabling poet's lays,<br/>While led along the skies his current strays,<br/>As thine, which visits Windsor's famed abodes,<br/>To grace the mansion of our earthly gods:<br/>Nor all his stars above a lustre show,<br/>Like the bright beauties on thy banks below;<br/>Where Jove, subdued by mortal passion still,<br/>Might change Olympus for a nobler hill.<br/><br/>Happy the man whom this bright court approves,<br/>His sovereign favours, and his country loves:<br/>Happy next him who to these shades retires,<br/>Whom Nature charms, and whom the Muse inspires:<br/>Whom humbler joys of home-felt quiet please,<br/>Successive study, exercise, and ease.<br/>He gathers health from herbs the forest yields,<br/>And of their fragrant physic spoils the fields:<br/>With chemic art exalts the mineral powers,<br/>And draws the aromatic souls of flowers:<br/>Now marks the course of rolling orbs on high;<br/>O'er figured worlds now travels with his eye;<br/>Of ancient writ unlocks the learn√®d store,<br/>Consults the dead, and lives past ages o'er:<br/>Or wandering thoughtful in the silent wood,<br/>Attends the duties of the wise and good,<br/>To observe a mean, be to himself a friend,<br/>To follow nature, and regard his end;<br/>Or looks on Heaven with more than mortal eyes,<br/>Bids his free soul expatiate in the skies,<br/>Amid her kindred stars familiar roam,<br/>Survey the region, and confess her home!<br/>Such was the life great Scipio once admired,<br/>Thus Atticus, and Trumbull thus retired.<br/><br/>Ye sacred Nine! that all my soul possess,<br/>Whose raptures fire me, and whose visions bless,<br/>Bear me, oh, bear me to sequester'd scenes,<br/>The bowery mazes, and surrounding greens:<br/>To Thames's banks which fragrant breezes fill,<br/>Or where ye Muses sport on Cooper's Hill.<br/>(On Cooper's Hill eternal wreaths shall grow,<br/>While lasts the mountain, or while Thames shall flow.)<br/>I seem through consecrated walks to rove,<br/>I hear soft music die along the grove:<br/>Led by the sound, I roam from shade to shade,<br/>By godlike poets venerable made:<br/>Here his first lays majestic Denham sung;<br/>There the last numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue. 270<br/>Oh early lost! what tears the river shed,<br/>When the sad pomp along his banks was led!<br/>His drooping swans on every note expire,<br/>And on his willows hung each Muse's lyre.<br/><br/>Since fate relentless stopp'd their heavenly voice,<br/>No more the forests ring, or groves rejoice;<br/>Who now shall charm the shades, where Cowley strung<br/>His living harp, and lofty Denham sung?<br/>But hark! the groves rejoice, the forest rings!<br/>Are these revived? or is it Granville sings?<br/>'Tis yours, my lord, to bless our soft retreats,<br/>And call the Muses to their ancient seats;<br/>To paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes,<br/>To crown the forest with immortal greens,<br/>Make Windsor hills in lofty numbers rise,<br/>And lift her turrets nearer to the skies;<br/>To sing those honours you deserve to wear,<br/>And add new lustre to her silver star.<br/><br/>Here noble Surrey felt the sacred rage,<br/>Surrey, the Granville of a former age:<br/>Matchless his pen, victorious was his lance,<br/>Bold in the lists, and graceful in the dance:<br/>In the same shades the Cupids tuned his lyre,<br/>To the same notes, of love and soft desire:<br/>Fair Geraldine, bright object of his vow,<br/>Then fill'd the groves, as heavenly Mira now.<br/><br/>Oh, wouldst thou sing what heroes Windsor bore,<br/>What kings first breathed upon her winding shore,<br/>Or raise old warriors, whose adored remains<br/>In weeping vaults her hallow'd earth contains!<br/>With Edward's acts adorn the shining page,<br/>Stretch his long triumphs down through every age,<br/>Draw monarchs chain'd, and Cressy's glorious field,<br/>The lilies blazing on the regal shield:<br/>Then, from her roofs when Verrio's colours fall,<br/>And leave inanimate the naked wall,<br/>Still in thy song should vanquish'd France appear,<br/>And bleed for ever under Britain's spear.<br/><br/>Let softer strains ill-fated Henry mourn,<br/>And palms eternal flourish round his urn.<br/>Here o'er the martyr-king the marble weeps,<br/>And, fast beside him, once-fear'd Edward sleeps.<br/>Whom not the extended Albion could contain,<br/>From old Belerium to the northern main,<br/>The grave unites; where ev'n the great find rest,<br/>And blended lie the oppressor and the oppress'd!<br/><br/>Make sacred Charles' tomb for ever known,<br/>(Obscure the place, and uninscribed the stone)<br/>Oh fact accursed! what tears has Albion shed,<br/>Heavens, what new wounds! and how her old have bled!<br/>She saw her sons with purple deaths expire,<br/>Her sacred domes involved in rolling fire,<br/>A dreadful series of intestine wars,<br/>Inglorious triumphs and dishonest scars.<br/>At length great Anna said--'Let discord cease!'<br/>She said, the world obey'd, and all was peace!<br/><br/>In that blest moment, from his oozy bed<br/>Old Father Thames advanced his reverend head;<br/>His tresses dropp'd with dews, and o'er the stream<br/>His shining horns diffused a golden gleam:<br/>Graved on his urn appear'd the moon, that guides<br/>His swelling waters, and alternate tides;<br/>The figured streams in waves of silver roll'd,<br/>And on their banks Augusta rose in gold.<br/>Around his throne the sea-born brothers stood,<br/>Who swell with tributary urns his flood;<br/>First the famed authors of his ancient name,<br/>The winding Isis and the fruitful Thame:<br/>The Kennet swift, for silver eels renown'd;<br/>The Loddon slow, with verdant alders crown'd;<br/>Cole, whose dark streams his flowery islands lave;<br/>And chalky Wey, that rolls a milky wave;<br/>The blue, transparent Vandalis appears;<br/>The gulfy Lee his sedgy tresses rears;<br/>And sullen Mole, that hides his diving flood;<br/>And silent Darent, stain'd with Danish blood.<br/><br/>High in the midst, upon his urn reclined,<br/>(His sea-green mantle waving with the wind)<br/>The god appear'd: he turn'd his azure eyes<br/>Where Windsor-domes and pompous turrets rise;<br/>Then bow'd and spoke; the winds forget to roar,<br/>And the hush'd waves glide softly to the shore.<br/><br/>Hail, sacred Peace! hail, long-expected days,<br/>That Thames's glory to the stars shall raise!<br/>Though Tiber's streams immortal Rome behold,<br/>Though foaming Hermus swells with tides of gold,<br/>From heaven itself though sevenfold Nilus flows,<br/>And harvests on a hundred realms bestows;<br/>These now no more shall be the Muse's themes,<br/>Lost in my fame, as in the sea their streams.<br/>Let Volga's banks with iron squadrons shine,<br/>And groves of lances glitter on the Rhine,<br/>Let barbarous Ganges arm a servile train;<br/>Be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign.<br/>No more my sons shall dye with British blood<br/>Red Iber's sands, or Ister's foaming flood:<br/>Safe on my shore each unmolested swain<br/>Shall tend the flocks, or reap the bearded grain;<br/>The shady empire shall retain no trace<br/>Of war or blood, but in the sylvan chase;<br/>The trumpet sleep, while cheerful horns are blown,<br/>And arms employ'd on birds and beasts alone.<br/>Behold! the ascending villas on my side,<br/>Project long shadows o'er the crystal tide,<br/>Behold! Augusta's glittering spires increase,<br/>And temples rise, the beauteous works of Peace.<br/>I see, I see, where two fair cities bend<br/>Their ample bow, a new Whitehall ascend!<br/>There mighty nations shall inquire their doom,<br/>The world's great oracle in times to come;<br/>There kings shall sue, and suppliant states be seen<br/>Once more to bend before a British queen.<br/><br/>Thy trees, fair Windsor! now shall leave their woods,<br/>And half thy forests rush into the floods,<br/>Bear Britain's thunder, and her cross display,<br/>To the bright regions of the rising day;<br/>Tempt icy seas, where scarce the waters roll,<br/>Where clearer flames glow round the frozen pole;<br/>Or under southern skies exalt their sails,<br/>Led by new stars, and borne by spicy gales!<br/>For me the balm shall bleed, and amber flow,<br/>The coral redden, and the ruby glow,<br/>The pearly shell its lucid globe infold,<br/>And Phoebus warm the ripening ore to gold.<br/>The time shall come when, free as seas or wind,<br/>Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind,<br/>Whole nations enter with each swelling tide,<br/>And seas but join the regions they divide;<br/>Earth's distant ends our glory shall behold,<br/>And the new world launch forth to seek the old.<br/>Then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tide,<br/>And feather'd people crowd my wealthy side,<br/>And naked youths and painted chiefs admire<br/>Our speech, our colour, and our strange attire!<br/>O stretch thy reign, fair Peace! from shore to shore,<br/>Till conquest cease, and slavery be no more;<br/>Till the freed Indians in their native groves<br/>Reap their own fruits, and woo their sable loves,<br/>Peru once more a race of kings behold,<br/>And other Mexicos be roof'd with gold.<br/>Exiled by thee from earth to deepest hell,<br/>In brazen bonds, shall barbarous Discord dwell;<br/>Gigantic Pride, pale Terror, gloomy Care,<br/>And mad Ambition shall attend her there:<br/>There purple Vengeance bathed in gore retires,<br/>Her weapons blunted, and extinct her fires:<br/>There hateful Envy her own snakes shall feel,<br/>And Persecution mourn her broken wheel:<br/>There Faction roar, Rebellion bite her chain,<br/>And gasping Furies thirst for blood in vain.<br/><br/>Here cease thy flight, nor with unhallow'd lays<br/>Touch the fair fame of Albion's golden days:<br/>The thoughts of gods let Granville's verse recite,<br/>And bring the scenes of opening fate to light.<br/>My humble Muse, in unambitious strains,<br/>Paints the green forests and the flowery plains,<br/>Where Peace descending bids her olives spring,<br/>And scatters blessings from her dove-like wing.<br/>Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless days,<br/>Pleased in the silent shade with empty praise;<br/>Enough for me, that to the listening swains<br/>First in these fields I sung the sylvan strains.
