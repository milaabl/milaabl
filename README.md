# üíÆ The Little Black Boy by *William Blake*

<p>
    My mother bore me in the southern wild,<br/>  And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!<br/>White as an angel is the English child,<br/>  But I am black, as if bereaved of light.<br/><br/>My mother taught me underneath a tree,<br/>  And, sitting down before the heat of day,<br/>She took me on her lap and kissed me,<br/>  And, pointed to the east, began to say:<br/><br/>"Look on the rising sun: there God does live,<br/>  And gives His light, and gives His heat away,<br/>And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive<br/>  Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.<br/><br/>"And we are put on earth a little space,<br/>  That we may learn to bear the beams of love<br/>And these black bodies and this sunburnt face<br/>  Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.<br/><br/>"For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,<br/>  The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,<br/>Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care<br/>  And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',"<br/><br/>Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;<br/>And thus I say to little English boy.<br/>When I from black and he from white cloud free,<br/>And round the tent of God like lambs we joy<br/><br/>I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear<br/>To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;<br/>And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,<br/>And be like him, and he will then love me.
</p>
