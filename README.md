# üíÆ A Poem Upon The Death Of O.C. by *Andrew Marvell*

<p>
    That Providence which had so long the care<br/>Of Cromwell's head, and numbred ev'ry hair,<br/>Now in its self (the Glass where all appears)<br/>Had seen the period of his golden Years:<br/>And thenceforth onely did attend to trace,<br/>What death might least so sair a Life deface.<br/>The People, which what most they fear esteem,<br/>Death when more horrid so more noble deem;<br/>And blame the last Act, like Spectators vain,<br/>Unless the Prince whom they applaud be slain.<br/>Nor Fate indeed can well refuse that right<br/>To those that liv'd in War, to dye in Fight.<br/>But long his Valour none had left that could<br/>Indanger him, or Clemency that would.<br/>And he whom Nature all for Peace had made,<br/>But angry Heaven unto War had sway'd,<br/>And so less useful where he most desir'd,<br/>For what he least affected was admir'd,<br/>Deserved yet an End whose ev'ry part<br/>Should speak the wondrous softness of his Heart.<br/>To Love and Grief the fatal Writ was sign'd;<br/>(Those nobler weaknesses of humane Mind,<br/>From which those Powers that issu'd the Decree,<br/>Although immortal, found they were not free.)<br/>That they, to whom his Breast still open lyes,<br/>In gentle Passions should his Death disguise:<br/>And leave succeeding Ages cause to mourn,<br/>As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.<br/>Streight does a slow and languishing Disease<br/>Eliza, Natures and his darling, seize.<br/>Her when an infant, taken with her Charms,<br/>He oft would flourish in his mighty Arms;<br/>And, lest their force the tender burthen wrong,<br/>Slacken the vigour of his Muscles strong;<br/>Then to the Mothers brest her softly move,<br/>Which while she drain'd of Milk she fill'd with Love:<br/>But as with riper Years her Virtue grew,<br/>And ev'ry minute adds a Lustre new;<br/>When with meridian height her Beauty shin'd,<br/>And thorough that sparkled her fairer Mind;<br/>When She with Smiles serene and Words discreet<br/>His hidden Soul at ev'ry turn could meet;<br/>Then might y' ha' daily his Affection spy'd,<br/>Doubling that knot which Destiny had ty'd:<br/>While they by sence, not knowing, comprehend<br/>How on each other both their Fates depend.<br/>With her each day the pleasing Hours he shares,<br/>And at her Aspect calms her growing Cares;<br/>Or with a Grandsire's joy her Children sees<br/>Hanging about her neck or at his knees.<br/>Hold fast dear Infants, hold them both or none;<br/>This will not stay when once the other's gone.<br/>A silent fire now wasts those Limbs of Wax,<br/>And him with his tortur'd Image racks.<br/>So the Flowr with'ring which the Garden crown'd,<br/>The sad Root pines in secret under ground.<br/>Each Groan he doubled and each Sigh he sigh'd,<br/>Repeated over to the restless Night.<br/>No trembling String compos'd to numbers new,<br/>Answers the touch in Notes more sad more true.<br/>She lest He grieve hides what She can her pains,<br/>And He to lessen hers his Sorrow feigns:<br/>Yet both perceiv'd, yet both conceal'd their Skills,<br/>And so diminishing increast their ills:<br/>That whether by each others grief they fell,<br/>Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.<br/>And now Eliza's purple Locks were shorn,<br/>Where she so long her Fathers fate had worn:<br/>And frequent lightning to her Soul that flyes,<br/>Devides the Air, and opens all the Skyes:<br/>And now his Life, suspended by her breath,<br/>Ran out impetuously to hasting Death.<br/>Like polish'd Mirrours, so his steely Brest<br/>Had ev'ry figure of her woes exprest;<br/>And with the damp of her last Gasps obscur'd,<br/>Had drawn such staines as were not to be cur'd.<br/>Fate could not either reach with single stroke,<br/>But the dear Image fled the Mirrour broke.<br/>Who now shall tell us more of mournful Swans,<br/>Of Halcyons kind, or bleeding Pelicans?<br/>No downy breast did ere so gently beat,<br/>Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat.<br/>For he no duty by his height excus'd,<br/>Nor though a Prince to be a Man refus'd:<br/>But rather then in his Eliza's pain<br/>Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign.<br/>And in himself so oft immortal try'd,<br/>Yet in compassion of another dy'd.<br/>So have I seen a Vine, whose lasting Age<br/>Of many a Winter hath surviv'd the rage.<br/>Under whose shady tent Men ev'ry year<br/>At its rich bloods expence their Sorrows chear,<br/>If some dear branch where it extends its life<br/>Chance to be prun'd by an untimely knife,<br/>The Parent-Tree unto the Grief succeeds,<br/>And through the Wound its vital humour bleeds;<br/>Trickling in watry drops, whose flowing shape<br/>Weeps that it falls ere fix'd into a Grape.<br/>So the dry Stock, no more that spreading Vine,<br/>Frustrates the Autumn and the hopes of Wine.<br/>A secret Cause does sure those Signs ordain<br/>Fore boding Princes falls, and seldom vain.<br/>Whether some Kinder Pow'rs, that wish us well,<br/>What they above cannot prevent, foretell;<br/>Or the great World do by consent presage,<br/>As hollow Seas with future Tempests rage:<br/>Or rather Heav'n, which us so long fore sees,<br/>Their fun'rals celebrate while it decrees.<br/>But never yet was any humane Fate<br/>By nature solemniz'd with so much state.<br/>He unconcern'd the dreadful passage crost;<br/>But oh what pangs that Death did Nature cost!<br/>First the great Thunder was shot off, and sent<br/>The Signal from the starry Battlement.<br/>The Winds receive it, and its force out-do,<br/>As practising how they could thunder too:<br/>Out of the Binders Hand the Sheaves they tore,<br/>And thrash'd the Harvest in the airy floore;<br/>Or of huge Trees, whose growth with his did rise,<br/>The deep foundations open'd to the Skyes.<br/>Then heavy Showres the winged Tempests dead,<br/>And pour the Deluge ore the Chaos head.<br/>The Race of warlike Horses at his Tomb<br/>Offer themselves in many an Hecatomb;<br/>With pensive head towards the ground they fall,<br/>And helpless languish at the tainted Stall.<br/>Numbers of Men decrease with pains unknown,<br/>And hasten not to see his Death their own.<br/>Such Tortures all the Elements unfix'd,<br/>Troubled to part where so exactly mix'd.<br/>And as through Air his wasting Spirits flow'd,<br/>The Universe labour'd beneath their load.<br/>Nature it seem'd with him would Nature vye;<br/>He with Eliza, It with him would dye.<br/>He without noise still travell'd to his End,<br/>As silent Suns to meet the Night descend.<br/>The Stars that for him fought had only pow'r<br/>Left to determine now his fatal Hour,<br/>Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast<br/>To chuse it worthy of his Glories past.<br/>No part of time but bore his mark away<br/>Of honour; all the Year was Cromwell's day<br/>But this, of all the most auspicious found,<br/>Twice had in open field him Victor crown'd<br/>When up the armed Mountains of Dunbar<br/>He march'd, and through deep Severn ending war.<br/>What day should him eternize but the same<br/>That had before immortaliz'd his Name?<br/>That so who ere would at his Death have joy'd,<br/>In their own Griefs might find themselves imploy'd;<br/>But those that sadly his departure griev'd,<br/>Yet joy'd remembring what he once atcheiv'd.<br/>And the last minute his victorious Ghost<br/>Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgick Coast.<br/>Here ended all his mortal toyles: He lay'd<br/>And slept in Peace under the Lawrel Shade.<br/>O Cromwell, Heavens Favourite! To none<br/>Have such high honours from above been shown:<br/>For whom the Elements we Mourners see,<br/>And Heav'n it self would the great Herald be;<br/>Which with more Care set forth his Obsequies<br/>Then those of Moses hid from humane Eyes;<br/>As jealous only here lest all be less,<br/>That we could to his Memory express.<br/>Then let us to our course of Mourning keep:<br/>Where Heaven leads, 'tis Piety to weep.<br/>Stand back ye Seas, and shrunk beneath the vail<br/>Of your Abysse, with cover'd Head bewail<br/>Your Monarch: We demand not your supplies<br/>To compass in our Isle; our Tears suffice;<br/>Since him away the dismal Tempest rent,<br/>Who once more joyn'd us to the Continent;<br/>Who planted England on the Flandrick shoar,<br/>And stretch'd our frontire to the Indian Ore;<br/>Whose greater Truths obscure the Fables old,<br/>Whether of British Saints or Worthy's told;<br/>And in a valour less'ning Arthur's deeds,<br/>For Holyness the Confessor exceeds.<br/>He first put Armes into Religions hand,<br/>And tim'rous Conscience unto Courage man'd:<br/>The Souldier taught that inward Mail to wear,<br/>And fearing God how they should nothing fear.<br/>Those Strokes he said will pierce through all below<br/>Where those that strike from Heaven fetch their Blow.<br/><br/>Note: The remainder is supplied from Ms Eng.poet.d.49<br/>Astonish'd armyes did their flight prepare:<br/>And Cityes strong were stormed by his prayer.<br/>Of that for ever Prestons field shall tell<br/>The Story, and impregnable Clonmell.<br/>And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scald<br/>The Sea between yet henee his pray'r prevail'd.<br/>What man was ever so in Heav'n obey'd<br/>Since the commanded Sun ore Gibeon stayd.<br/>In all his warrs needs must he triumph, when<br/>He conquer'd God still ere he fought with men.<br/>Hence though in battle none so brave or fierce<br/>Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce:<br/>Pitty it seem'd to hurt him more that felt<br/>Each wound himself which he to others delt,<br/>Danger it self refusing to offend<br/>So loose an enemy so fast a freind.<br/>Friendship that sacred versue long das claime<br/>The first foundation of his house and name.<br/>But within one its narrow limitts fall<br/>His tendernesse extended unto all:<br/>And that deep soule through every chanell flows<br/>Where kindly nature loves it self to lose.<br/>More strong affections never reason serv'd<br/>Yet still affected most what best deservd.<br/>If he Eliza lov'd to that degree<br/>(Though who more worstly to be lov'd then she)<br/>If so indulgent to his own, how deare<br/>To him the children of the Highest were?<br/>For her he once did natures tribute pay:<br/>For these his life adventur'd every day.<br/>And it would be found could we his thoughts have<br/>Their griefs struck deepest if Eliza's last.<br/>What prudence more then humane did he need<br/>To keep so deare, so diff'ring mindes agreed?<br/>The worser sort as conscious of their ill,<br/>Lye weak and easy to the rulers will:<br/>But to the good (too many or too few).<br/>All law is uselesse all reward is due.<br/>Oh ill advis'd if not for love for shame.<br/>Spare yet your own if you neglect his fame.<br/>Least others dare to think your reale a maske<br/>And you to govern only Heavens taske.<br/>Valour, Religion, Friendship, Prudence dy'd<br/>At once with him and all that's good beside:<br/>And rue deaths refuse natures dreg's confin'd<br/>To loathsome life Alas are left behinde:<br/>Where we (so once we us'd) shall now no more<br/>To fetch day presse about his chamber door;<br/>From which he issu'd with that awfull state<br/>It seem'd Mars broke through Janus double gate:<br/>Yet alwayes temper'd with an Aire so mild<br/>No Aprill suns that ere so gently smil'd:<br/>No more shall heare that powerfull language charm.<br/>Whose force oft spar'd the labour of his arm:<br/>No more shall follow where he spent the dayes<br/>In warres in counsell, or in pray'r, and praise,<br/>Whose meanest acts he would himself advance<br/>As ungirt David to the Arks did dance.<br/>All All is gone of ours or his delight<br/>In horses fierce wild deer or armour bright.<br/>Francisca faire can nothing now but weep<br/>Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep.<br/>I saw him dead, a leaden slumber lyes<br/>And mortall sleep over those wakefull eys:<br/>Those gentle Rayes under the lidds were fled<br/>Which through his lookes that piercing sweetnesse she<br/>That port which so Majestique was and strong,<br/>Loose and depriv'd of vigour stretch'd along:<br/>All wither'd, all discolour'd, pale and wan,<br/>How much another thing, no more thatman?<br/>Oh humane glory vaine, Oh death, Oh wings,<br/>Oh worthlesse worth. Oh transitory things.<br/>Yet dwelt that greatnesse in his shape decay'd<br/>That still though dead greater than death he lay'd.<br/>And in his alter'd face you something faigne<br/>That threatens death he yet will live againe.<br/>Not much unlike the saired Oake which shoots<br/>To heav'n its branches and through earth its roots:<br/>Whose spacious boughs are hung with Trophees row<br/>And honour'd wreaths have oft the Victour crown<br/>When angry Jove darts lightning through the Aire<br/>At mortalls sins, nor his own plant will spare<br/>(It groanes and bruses all below that stood<br/>So many yeares the shelter of the wood)<br/>The tree ere while foreshorten'd to our view<br/>When foln shews taller yet then as it grew.<br/>So shall his praise to after times increase<br/>When truth shall be allow'd and faction cease.<br/>And his own shadow with him fall. The Eye<br/>Detracts from objects then it selfe more high:<br/>But when death takes them from that envy'd seate<br/>Seing how little we confesse how greate.<br/>Thee many ages hence in martiall verse<br/>Shall th' English souldier ere he charge rehearse:<br/>Singing of thee influme themselves to fight<br/>And with the name of Cromwell armyes fright.<br/>As long as rivers to the seas shall runne.<br/>As long as Cynthia shall relieve the sunne,<br/>While staggs shall fly unto the forests thick,<br/>While sheep delight the grassy downs to pick,<br/>As long as future time succeeds the past,<br/>Always thy honour, praise and name shall last.<br/>Thou in a pitch how farre, beyond the sphere<br/>Of humane glory towr'st, and raigning there<br/>Despoyld of mortall robes, in seas of cliyse<br/>Plunging dost bathe, and tread the bright Abysse:<br/>There thy greate soule yet once a world das see<br/>Spacious enough and pure enough for thee.<br/>How soon thou Moses hast and Josua found<br/>And David for the Sword, and harpe renown'd?<br/>How streight canst to each happy Mansion goe?<br/>(Farr Better known above then here below)<br/>And in those joyes dost spend the endlesse day<br/>Which in expressing we our selves betray.<br/>For we since thou art gone with heavy doome<br/>Wander like ghosts about thy loved tombe:<br/>And lost in tears have neither sight nor minde<br/>To guide us upward through this Region blinde<br/>Since thou art gone who best that way could'st fearn<br/>Onely our sighs perhaps may thither reach.<br/>And Richard yet where his great Parent led<br/>Beats on the rugged track: He vertue dead<br/>Revives, and by his milder beams assures;<br/>And yet how much of them his griefe obscures?<br/>He as his rather long was kept from sight<br/>In private to be view'd by better light:<br/>But open'd once, what splendour dos he throw<br/>A Cromwell in an houre a Prince will grow.<br/>How he becomes that seat, how strongly streins<br/>How gently winds at once the ruling Reins?<br/>Heav'n to this choise prepar'd a Diadem<br/>Richer then any Eastern silk or gemme:<br/>A pearly rainbow; where the Sun inchas'd<br/>His brows like an Imperiall Jewell grac'd.<br/>We find already what those Omens mean.<br/>Earth nere more glad, nor Heaven more serene:<br/>Cease now our griefs, Calme peace succeeds a war<br/>Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver.<br/>Tempt not his clemency to try his pow'r<br/>He threats no Deluge, yet fore tells a showre.
