# üíÆ Oscar of Alva by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    How sweetly shines, through azure skies,<br/>  The lamp of Heaven on Lora's shore;<br/>Where Alva's hoary turrets rise,<br/>  And hear the din of arms no more!<br/><br/>But often has yon rolling moon,<br/>  On Alva's casques of silver play'd;<br/>And view'd, at midnight's silent noon,<br/>  Her chiefs in gleaming mail array'd:<br/><br/>And, on the crimson'd rocks beneath,<br/>  Which scowl o'er ocean's sullen flow,<br/>Pale in the scatter'd ranks of death,<br/>  She saw the gasping warrior low;<br/><br/>While many an eye, which ne'er again<br/>  Could mark the rising orb of day,<br/>Turn'd feebly from the gory plain,<br/>  Beheld in death her fading ray.<br/><br/>Once, to those eyes the lamp of Love,<br/>  They blest her dear propitious light;<br/>But, now, she glimmer'd from above,<br/>  A sad, funereal torch of night.<br/><br/>Faded is Alva's noble race,<br/>  And grey her towers are seen afar;<br/>No more her heroes urge the chase,<br/>  Or roll the crimson tide of war.<br/><br/>But, who was last of Alva's clan?<br/>  Why grows the moss on Alva's stone?<br/>Her towers resound no steps of man,<br/>  They echo to the gale alone.<br/><br/>And, when that gale is fierce and high,<br/>  A sound is heard in yonder hall;<br/>It rises hoarsely through the sky,<br/>  And vibrates o'er the mould'ring wall.<br/><br/>Yes, when the eddying tempest sighs,<br/>  It shakes the shield of Oscar brave;<br/>But, there, no more his banners rise,<br/>  No more his plumes of sable wave.<br/><br/>Fair shone the sun on Oscar's birth,<br/>  When Angus hail'd his eldest born;<br/>The vassals round their chieftain's hearth<br/>  Crowd to applaud the happy morn.<br/><br/>They feast upon the mountain deer,<br/>  The Pibroch rais'd its piercing note,<br/>To gladden more their Highland cheer,<br/>  The strains in martial numbers float.<br/><br/>And they who heard the war-notes wild,<br/>  Hop'd that, one day, the Pibroch's strain<br/>Should play before the Hero's child,<br/>  While he should lead the Tartan train.<br/><br/>Another year is quickly past,<br/>  And Angus hails another son;<br/>His natal day is like the last,<br/>  Nor soon the jocund feast was done.<br/><br/>Taught by their sire to bend the bow,<br/>  On Alva's dusky hills of wind,<br/>The boys in childhood chas'd the roe,<br/>  And left their hounds in speed behind.<br/><br/>But ere their years of youth are o'er,<br/>  They mingle in the ranks of war;<br/>They lightly wheel the bright claymore,<br/>  And send the whistling arrow far.<br/><br/>Dark was the flow of Oscar's hair,<br/>  Wildly it stream'd along the gale;<br/>But Allan's locks were bright and fair,<br/>  And pensive seem'd his cheek, and pale.<br/><br/>But Oscar own'd a hero's soul,<br/>  His dark eye shone through beams of truth;<br/>Allan had early learn'd controul,<br/>  And smooth his words had been from youth.<br/><br/>Both, both were brave; the Saxon spear<br/>  Was shiver'd oft beneath their steel;<br/>And Oscar's bosom scorn'd to fear,<br/>  But Oscar's bosom knew to feel;<br/><br/>While Allan's soul belied his form,<br/>  Unworthy with such charms to dwell:<br/>Keen as the lightning of the storm,<br/>  On foes his deadly vengeance fell.<br/><br/>From high Southannon's distant tower<br/>  Arrived a young and noble dame;<br/>With Kenneth's lands to form her dower,<br/>  Glenalvon's blue-eyed daughter came;<br/><br/>And Oscar claim'd the beauteous bride,<br/>  And Angus on his Oscar smil'd:<br/>It soothed the father's feudal pride<br/>  Thus to obtain Glenalvon's child.<br/><br/>Hark! to the Pibroch's pleasing note,<br/>  Hark! to the swelling nuptial song,<br/>In joyous strains the voices float,<br/>  And, still, the choral peal prolong.<br/><br/>See how the Heroes' blood-red plumes<br/>  Assembled wave in Alva's hall;<br/>Each youth his varied plaid assumes,<br/>  Attending on their chieftain's call.<br/><br/>It is not war their aid demands,<br/>  The Pibroch plays the song of peace;<br/>To Oscar's nuptials throng the bands<br/>  Nor yet the sounds of pleasure cease.<br/><br/>But where is Oscar? sure 'tis late:<br/>  Is this a bridegroom's ardent flame?<br/>While thronging guests and ladies wait,<br/>  Nor Oscar nor his brother came.<br/><br/>At length young Allan join'd the bride;<br/>  "Why comes not Oscar?" Angus said:<br/>"Is he not here?" the Youth replied;<br/>  "With me he rov'd not o'er the glade:<br/><br/>"Perchance, forgetful of the day,<br/>  'Tis his to chase the bounding roe;<br/>Or Ocean's waves prolong his stay:<br/>  Yet, Oscar's bark is seldom slow."<br/><br/>"Oh, no!" the anguish'd Sire rejoin'd,<br/>  "Nor chase, nor wave, my Boy delay;<br/>Would he to Mora seem unkind?<br/>  Would aught to her impede his way?<br/><br/>"Oh, search, ye Chiefs! oh, search around!<br/>  Allan, with these, through Alva fly;<br/>Till Oscar, till my son is found,<br/>  Haste, haste, nor dare attempt reply."<br/><br/>All is confusion--through the vale,<br/>  The name of Oscar hoarsely rings,<br/>It rises on the murm'ring gale,<br/>  Till night expands her dusky wings.<br/><br/>It breaks the stillness of the night,<br/>  But echoes through her shades in vain;<br/>It sounds through morning's misty light,<br/>  But Oscar comes not o'er the plain.<br/><br/>Three days, three sleepless nights, the Chief<br/>  For Oscar search'd each mountain cave;<br/>Then hope is lost; in boundless grief,<br/>  His locks in grey-torn ringlets wave.<br/><br/>"Oscar! my son!--thou God of Heav'n,<br/>  Restore the prop of sinking age!<br/>Or, if that hope no more is given,<br/>  Yield his assassin to my rage.<br/><br/>"Yes, on some desert rocky shore<br/>  My Oscar's whiten'd bones must lie;<br/>Then grant, thou God! I ask no more,<br/>  With him his frantic Sire may die!<br/><br/>"Yet, he may live,--away, despair!<br/>  Be calm, my soul! he yet may live;<br/>T' arraign my fate, my voice forbear!<br/>  O God! my impious prayer forgive.<br/><br/>"What, if he live for me no more,<br/>  I sink forgotten in the dust,<br/>The hope of Alva's age is o'er:<br/>  Alas! can pangs like these be just?"<br/><br/>Thus did the hapless Parent mourn,<br/>  Till Time, who soothes severest woe,<br/>Had bade serenity return,<br/>  And made the tear-drop cease to flow.<br/><br/>For, still, some latent hope surviv'd<br/>  That Oscar might once more appear;<br/>His hope now droop'd and now revived,<br/>  Till Time had told a tedious year.<br/><br/>Days roll'd along, the orb of light<br/>  Again had run his destined race;<br/>No Oscar bless'd his father's sight,<br/>  And sorrow left a fainter trace.<br/><br/>For youthful Allan still remain'd,<br/>  And, now, his father's only joy:<br/>And Mora's heart was quickly gain'd,<br/>  For beauty crown'd the fair-hair'd boy.<br/><br/>She thought that Oscar low was laid,<br/>  And Allan's face was wondrous fair;<br/>If Oscar liv'd, some other maid<br/>  Had claim'd his faithless bosom's care.<br/><br/>And Angus said, if one year more<br/>  In fruitless hope was pass'd away,<br/>His fondest scruples should be o'er,<br/>  And he would name their nuptial day.<br/><br/>Slow roll'd the moons, but blest at last<br/>  Arriv'd the dearly destin'd morn:<br/>The year of anxious trembling past,<br/>  What smiles the lovers' cheeks adorn!<br/><br/>Hark to the Pibroch's pleasing note!<br/>  Hark to the swelling nuptial song!<br/>In joyous strains the voices float,<br/>  And, still, the choral peal prolong.<br/><br/>Again the clan, in festive crowd,<br/>  Throng through the gate of Alva's hall;<br/>The sounds of mirth re-echo loud,<br/>  And all their former joy recall.<br/><br/>But who is he, whose darken'd brow<br/>  Glooms in the midst of general mirth?<br/>Before his eyes' far fiercer glow<br/>  The blue flames curdle o'er the hearth.<br/><br/>Dark is the robe which wraps his form,<br/>  And tall his plume of gory red;<br/>His voice is like the rising storm,<br/>  But light and trackless is his tread.<br/><br/>'Tis noon of night, the pledge goes round,<br/>  The bridegroom's health is deeply quaff'd;<br/>With shouts the vaulted roofs resound,<br/>  And all combine to hail the draught.<br/><br/>Sudden the stranger-chief arose,<br/>  And all the clamorous crowd are hush'd;<br/>And Angus' cheek with wonder glows,<br/>  And Mora's tender bosom blush'd.<br/><br/>"Old man!" he cried, "this pledge is done,<br/>  Thou saw'st 'twas truly drunk by me;<br/>It hail'd the nuptials of thy son:<br/>  Now will I claim a pledge from thee.<br/><br/>"While all around is mirth and joy,<br/>  To bless thy Allan's happy lot,<br/>Say, hadst thou ne'er another boy?<br/>  Say, why should Oscar be forgot?"<br/><br/>"Alas!" the hapless Sire replied,<br/>  The big tear starting as he spoke,<br/>"When Oscar left my hall, or died,<br/>  This aged heart was almost broke.<br/><br/>"Thrice has the earth revolv'd her course<br/>  Since Oscar's form has bless'd my sight;<br/>And Allan is my last resource,<br/>  Since martial Oscar's death, or flight."<br/><br/>"'Tis well," replied the stranger stern,<br/>  And fiercely flash'd his rolling eye;<br/>"Thy Oscar's fate, I fain would learn;<br/>  Perhaps the Hero did not die.<br/><br/>"Perchance, if those, whom most he lov'd,<br/>  Would call, thy Oscar might return;<br/>Perchance, the chief has only rov'd;<br/>  For him thy Beltane, yet, may burn.<br/><br/>"Fill high the bowl the table round,<br/>  We will not claim the pledge by stealth;<br/>With wine let every cup be crown'd;<br/>  Pledge me departed Oscar's health."<br/><br/>"With all my soul," old Angus said,<br/>  And fill'd his goblet to the brim:<br/>"Here's to my boy! alive or dead,<br/>  I ne'er shall find a son like him."<br/><br/>"Bravely, old man, this health has sped;<br/>  But why does Allan trembling stand?<br/>Come, drink remembrance of the dead,<br/>  And raise thy cup with firmer hand."<br/><br/>The crimson glow of Allan's face<br/>  Was turn'd at once to ghastly hue;<br/>The drops of death each other chace,<br/>  Adown in agonizing dew.<br/><br/>Thrice did he raise the goblet high,<br/>  And thrice his lips refused to taste;<br/>For thrice he caught the stranger's eye<br/>  On his with deadly fury plac'd.<br/><br/>"And is it thus a brother hails<br/>  A brother's fond remembrance here?<br/>If thus affection's strength prevails,<br/>  What might we not expect from fear?"<br/><br/>Roused by the sneer, he rais'd the bowl,<br/>  "Would Oscar now could share our mirth!"<br/>Internal fear appall'd his soul;<br/>  He said, and dash'd the cup to earth.<br/><br/>"'Tis he! I hear my murderer's voice!"<br/>  Loud shrieks a darkly gleaming Form.<br/>"A murderer's voice!" the roof replies,<br/>  And deeply swells the bursting storm.<br/><br/>The tapers wink, the chieftains shrink,<br/>  The stranger's gone,--amidst the crew,<br/>A Form was seen, in tartan green,<br/>  And tall the shade terrific grew.<br/><br/>His waist was bound with a broad belt round,<br/>  His plume of sable stream'd on high;<br/>But his breast was bare, with the red wounds there,<br/>  And fix'd was the glare of his glassy eye.<br/><br/>And thrice he smil'd, with his eye so wild<br/>  On Angus bending low the knee;<br/>And thrice he frown'd, on a Chief on the ground,<br/>  Whom shivering crowds with horror see.<br/><br/>The bolts loud roll from pole to pole,<br/>  And thunders through the welkin ring,<br/>And the gleaming form, through the mist of the storm,<br/>  Was borne on high by the whirlwind's wing.<br/><br/>Cold was the feast, the revel ceas'd.<br/>  Who lies upon the stony floor?<br/>Oblivion press'd old Angus' breast,<br/>  At length his life-pulse throbs once more.<br/><br/>"Away, away! let the leech essay<br/>  To pour the light on Allan's eyes:"<br/>His sand is done,--his race is run;<br/>  Oh! never more shall Allan rise!<br/><br/>But Oscar's breast is cold as clay,<br/>  His locks are lifted by the gale;<br/>And Allan's barb√®d arrow lay<br/>  With him in dark Glentanar's vale.<br/><br/>And whence the dreadful stranger came,<br/>  Or who, no mortal wight can tell;<br/>But no one doubts the form of flame,<br/>  For Alva's sons knew Oscar well.<br/><br/>Ambition nerv'd young Allan's hand,<br/>  Exulting demons wing'd his dart;<br/>While Envy wav'd her burning brand,<br/>  And pour'd her venom round his heart.<br/><br/>Swift is the shaft from Allan's bow;<br/>  Whose streaming life-blood stains his side?<br/>Dark Oscar's sable crest is low,<br/>  The dart has drunk his vital tide.<br/><br/>And Mora's eye could Allan move,<br/>  She bade his wounded pride rebel:<br/>Alas! that eyes, which beam'd with love,<br/>  Should urge the soul to deeds of Hell.<br/><br/>Lo! see'st thou not a lonely tomb,<br/>  Which rises o'er a warrior dead?<br/>It glimmers through the twilight gloom;<br/>  Oh! that is Allan's nuptial bed.<br/><br/>Far, distant far, the noble grave<br/>  Which held his clan's great ashes stood;<br/>And o'er his corse no banners wave,<br/>  For they were stain'd with kindred blood.<br/><br/>What minstrel grey, what hoary bard,<br/>  Shall Allan's deeds on harp-strings raise?<br/>The song is glory's chief reward,<br/>  But who can strike a murd'rer's praise?<br/><br/>Unstrung, untouch'd, the harp must stand,<br/>  No minstrel dare the theme awake;<br/>Guilt would benumb his palsied hand,<br/>  His harp in shuddering chords would break.<br/><br/>No lyre of fame, no hallow'd verse,<br/>  Shall sound his glories high in air:<br/>A dying father's bitter curse,<br/>  A brother's death-groan echoes there.
