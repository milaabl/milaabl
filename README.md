# üíÆ The Last Oracle by *Algernon Charles Swinburne*

<p>
    eipate toi basilei, xamai pese daidalos aula.<br/>ouketi PHoibos exei kaluban, ou mantida daphnen,<br/>ou pagan laleousan . apesbeto kai lalon udor.<br/><br/>Years have risen and fallen in darkness or in twilight,<br/>Ages waxed and waned that knew not thee nor thine,<br/>While the world sought light by night and sought not thy light,<br/>Since the sad last pilgrim left thy dark mid shrine.<br/>Dark the shrine and dumb the fount of song thence welling,<br/>Save for words more sad than tears of blood, that said:<br/>Tell the king, on earth has fallen the glorious dwelling,<br/>And the watersprings that spake are quenched and dead.<br/>Not a cell is left the God, no roof, no cover<br/>In his hand the prophet laurel flowers no more.<br/>And the great king's high sad heart, thy true last lover,<br/>Felt thine answer pierce and cleave it to the core.<br/>And he bowed down his hopeless head<br/>In the drift of the wild world's tide,<br/>And dying, Thou hast conquered, he said,<br/>Galilean; he said it, and died.<br/>And the world that was thine and was ours<br/>When the Graces took hands with the Hours<br/>Grew cold as a winter wave<br/>In the wind from a wide-mouthed grave,<br/>As a gulf wide open to swallow<br/>The light that the world held dear.<br/>O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,<br/>Destroyer and healer, hear!<br/><br/>Age on age thy mouth was mute, thy face was hidden,<br/>And the lips and eyes that loved thee blind and dumb;<br/>Song forsook their tongues that held thy name forbidden,<br/>Light their eyes that saw the strange God's kingdom come.<br/>Fire for light and hell for heaven and psalms for p√¶ans<br/>Filled the clearest eyes and lips most sweet of song,<br/>When for chant of Greeks the wail of Galileans<br/>Made the whole world moan with hymns of wrath and wrong.<br/>Yea, not yet we see thee, father, as they saw thee,<br/>They that worshipped when the world was theirs and thine,<br/>They whose words had power by thine own power to draw thee<br/>Down from heaven till earth seemed more than heaven divine.<br/>For the shades are about us that hover<br/>When darkness is half withdrawn<br/>And the skirts of the dead night cover<br/>The face of the live new dawn.<br/>For the past is not utterly past<br/>Though the word on its lips be the last,<br/>And the time be gone by with its creed<br/>When men were as beasts that bleed,<br/>As sheep or as swine that wallow,<br/>In the shambles of faith and of fear.<br/>O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,<br/>Destroyer and healer, hear!<br/><br/>Yet it may be, lord and father, could we know it,<br/>We that love thee for our darkness shall have light<br/>More than ever prophet hailed of old or poet<br/>Standing crowned and robed and sovereign in thy sight.<br/>To the likeness of one God their dreams enthralled thee,<br/>Who wast greater than all Gods that waned and grew;<br/>Son of God the shining son of Time they called thee,<br/>Who wast older, O our father, than they knew.<br/>For no thought of man made Gods to love or honour<br/>Ere the song within the silent soul began,<br/>Nor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her<br/>Till the word was clothed with speech by lips of man.<br/>And the word and the life wast thou,<br/>The spirit of man and the breath;<br/>And before thee the Gods that bow<br/>Take life at thine hands and death.<br/>For these are as ghosts that wane,<br/>That are gone in an age or twain;<br/>Harsh, merciful, passionate, pure,<br/>They perish, but thou shalt endure;<br/>Be their flight with the swan or the swallow,<br/>They pass as the flight of a year.<br/>O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,<br/>Destroyer and healer, hear!<br/><br/>Thou the word, the light, the life, the breath, the glory,<br/>Strong to help and heal, to lighten and to slay,<br/>Thine is all the song of man, the world's whole story;<br/>Not of morning and of evening is thy day.<br/>Old and younger Gods are buried or begotten<br/>From uprising to downsetting of thy sun,<br/>Risen from eastward, fallen to westward and forgotten,<br/>And their springs are many, but their end is one.<br/>Divers births of godheads find one death appointed,<br/>As the soul whence each was born makes room for each;<br/>God by God goes out, discrowned and disanointed,<br/>But the soul stands fast that gave them shape and speech.<br/>Is the sun yet cast out of heaven?<br/>Is the song yet cast out of man?<br/>Life that had song for its leaven<br/>To quicken the blood that ran<br/>Through the veins of the songless years<br/>More bitter and cold than tears,<br/>Heaven that had thee for its one<br/>Light, life, word, witness, O sun,<br/>Are they soundless and sightless and hollow,<br/>Without eye, without speech, without ear?<br/>O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,<br/>Destroyer and healer, hear!<br/><br/>Time arose and smote thee silent at his warning,<br/>Change and darkness fell on men that fell from thee;<br/>Dark thou satest, veiled with light, behind the morning,<br/>Till the soul of man should lift up eyes and see.<br/>Till the blind mute soul get speech again and eyesight,<br/>Man may worship not the light of life within;<br/>In his sight the stars whose fires grow dark in thy sight<br/>Shine as sunbeams on the night of death and sin.<br/>Time again is risen with mightier word of warning,<br/>Change hath blown again a blast of louder breath;<br/>Clothed with clouds and stars and dreams that melt in morning,<br/>Lo, the Gods that ruled by grace of sin and death!<br/>They are conquered, they break, they are stricken,<br/>Whose might made the whole world pale;<br/>They are dust that shall rise not or quicken<br/>Though the world for their death's sake wail.<br/>As a hound on a wild beast's trace,<br/>So time has their godhead in chase;<br/>As wolves when the hunt makes head,<br/>They are scattered, they fly, they are fled;<br/>They are fled beyond hail, beyond hollo,<br/>And the cry of the chase, and the cheer.<br/>O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,<br/>Destroyer and healer, hear!<br/><br/>Day by day thy shadow shines in heaven beholden,<br/>Even the sun, the shining shadow of thy face:<br/>King, the ways of heaven before thy feet grow golden;<br/>God, the soul of earth is kindled with thy grace.<br/>In thy lips the speech of man whence Gods were fashioned,<br/>In thy soul the thought that makes them and unmakes;<br/>By thy light and heat incarnate and impassioned,<br/>Soul to soul of man gives light for light and takes.<br/>As they knew thy name of old time could we know it,<br/>Healer called of sickness, slayer invoked of wrong,<br/>Light of eyes that saw thy light, God, king, priest, poet,<br/>Song should bring thee back to heal us with thy song.<br/>For thy kingdom is past not away,<br/>Nor thy power from the place thereof hurled;<br/>Out of heaven they shall cast not the day,<br/>They shall cast not out song from the world.<br/>By the song and the light they give<br/>We know thy works that they live;<br/>With the gift thou hast given us of speech<br/>We praise, we adore, we beseech,<br/>We arise at thy bidding and follow,<br/>We cry to thee, answer, appear,<br/>O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,<br/>Destroyer and healer, hear!
