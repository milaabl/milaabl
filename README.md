# üíÆ Locksley Hall by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early morn:<br/>Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle-horn.<br/><br/>'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,<br/>Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;<br/><br/>Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,<br/>And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.<br/><br/>Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,<br/>Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.<br/><br/>Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,<br/>Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.<br/><br/>Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime<br/>With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;<br/><br/>When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;<br/>When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:<br/><br/>When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;<br/>Saw the Vision of the world and all the wonder that would be.--<br/><br/>In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;<br/>In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;<br/><br/>In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;<br/>In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.<br/><br/>Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,<br/>And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.<br/><br/>And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,<br/>Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee."<br/><br/>On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,<br/>As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.<br/><br/>And she turn'd--her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs--<br/>All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes--<br/><br/>Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong";<br/>Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee long."<br/><br/>Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;<br/>Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.<br/><br/>Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;<br/>Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.<br/><br/>Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,<br/>And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.<br/><br/>Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,<br/>And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.<br/><br/>O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!<br/>O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!<br/><br/>Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,<br/>Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!<br/><br/>Is it well to wish thee happy?--having known me--to decline<br/>On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!<br/><br/>Yet it shall be; thou shalt lower to his level day by day,<br/>What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay.<br/><br/>As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,<br/>And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.<br/><br/>He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,<br/>Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.<br/><br/>What is this? his eyes are heavy; think not they are glazed with wine.<br/>Go to him, it is thy duty, kiss him, take his hand in thine.<br/><br/>It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:<br/>Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.<br/><br/>He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand--<br/>Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!<br/><br/>Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,<br/>Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.<br/><br/>Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!<br/>Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!<br/><br/>Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!<br/>Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!<br/><br/>Well--'t is well that I should bluster!--Hadst thou less unworthy proved--<br/>Would to God--for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.<br/><br/>Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?<br/>I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.<br/><br/>Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come<br/>As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.<br/><br/>Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?<br/>Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?<br/><br/>I remember one that perish'd; sweetly did she speak and move;<br/>Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.<br/><br/>Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?<br/>No--she never loved me truly; love is love for evermore.<br/><br/>Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,<br/>That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.<br/><br/>Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,<br/>In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.<br/><br/>Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,<br/>Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.<br/><br/>Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,<br/>To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.<br/><br/>Thou shalt hear the "Never, never," whisper'd by the phantom years,<br/>And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;<br/><br/>And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.<br/>Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest again.<br/><br/>Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry.<br/>'T is a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble dry.<br/><br/>Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee rest.<br/>Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.<br/><br/>O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.<br/>Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.<br/><br/>O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,<br/>With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.<br/><br/>"They were dangerous guides the feelings--she herself was not exempt--<br/>Truly, she herself had suffer'd"--Perish in thy self-contempt!<br/><br/>Overlive it--lower yet--be happy! wherefore should I care?<br/>I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.<br/><br/>What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?<br/>Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.<br/><br/>Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.<br/>I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do?<br/><br/>I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,<br/>When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound.<br/><br/>But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels,<br/>And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.<br/><br/>Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.<br/>Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!<br/><br/>Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,<br/>When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;<br/><br/>Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,<br/>Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,<br/><br/>And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,<br/>Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;<br/><br/>And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,<br/>Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men:<br/><br/>Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:<br/>That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:<br/><br/>For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,<br/>Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;<br/><br/>Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,<br/>Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales;<br/><br/>Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew<br/>From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;<br/><br/>Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,<br/>With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;<br/><br/>Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd<br/>In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.<br/><br/>There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,<br/>And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.<br/><br/>So I triumph'd ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,<br/>Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;<br/><br/>Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint:<br/>Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point:<br/><br/>Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,<br/>Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.<br/><br/>Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,<br/>And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.<br/><br/>What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,<br/>Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?<br/><br/>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,<br/>And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.<br/><br/>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,<br/>Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.<br/><br/>Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,<br/>They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:<br/><br/>Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string?<br/>I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.<br/><br/>Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain--<br/>Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:<br/><br/>Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine,<br/>Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine--<br/><br/>Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat<br/>Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;<br/><br/>Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd,--<br/>I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.<br/><br/>Or to burst all links of habit--there to wander far away,<br/>On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.<br/><br/>Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,<br/>Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.<br/><br/>Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,<br/>Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;<br/><br/>Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree--<br/>Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.<br/><br/>There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind,<br/>In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.<br/><br/>There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing space;<br/>I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.<br/><br/>Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run,<br/>Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;<br/><br/>Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks,<br/>Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books--<br/><br/>Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are wild,<br/>But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.<br/><br/>I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains,<br/>Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!<br/><br/>Mated with a squalid savage--what to me were sun or clime?<br/>I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time--<br/><br/>I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,<br/>Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!<br/><br/>Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,<br/>Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.<br/><br/>Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day;<br/>Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.<br/><br/>Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:<br/>Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun.<br/><br/>O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set.<br/>Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.<br/><br/>Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!<br/>Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.<br/><br/>Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,<br/>Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.<br/><br/>Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;<br/>For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.
