# üíÆ Satire IV. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    THE SATIRES OF DR JOHN DONNE, DEAN OF ST PAUL'S, VERSIFIED.<br/><br/>Well, if it be my time to quit the stage,<br/>Adieu to all the follies of the age!<br/>I die in charity with fool and knave,<br/>Secure of peace at least beyond the grave.<br/>I've had my purgatory here betimes,<br/>And paid for all my satires, all my rhymes.<br/>The poet's hell, its tortures, fiends, and flames.<br/>To this were trifles, toys, and empty names.<br/><br/>With foolish pride my heart was never fired,<br/>Nor the vain itch t' admire, or be admired;<br/>I hoped for no commission from his Grace;<br/>I bought no benefice, I begg'd no place;<br/>Had no new verses, nor new suit to show;<br/>Yet went to court!--the devil would have it so.<br/>But, as the fool that, in reforming days,<br/>Would go to mass in jest (as story says)<br/>Could not but think, to pay his fine was odd,<br/>Since 'twas no form'd design of serving God;<br/>So was I punish'd, as if full as proud,<br/>As prone to ill, as negligent of good.<br/>As deep in debt, without a thought to pay,<br/>As vain, as idle, and as false as they<br/>Who live at court, for going once that way!<br/>Scarce was I enter'd, when, behold! there came<br/>A thing which Adam had been posed to name;<br/>Noah had refused it lodging in his ark,<br/>Where all the race of reptiles might embark:<br/>A verier monster than on Afric's shore<br/>The sun e'er got, or slimy Nilus bore,<br/>Or Sloane or Woodward's wondrous shelves contain,<br/>Nay, all that lying travellers can feign.<br/>The watch would hardly let him pass at noon,<br/>At night, would swear him dropp'd out of the moon.<br/>One whom the mob, when next we find or make<br/>A Popish plot, shall for a Jesuit take,<br/>And the wise justice, starting from his chair,<br/>Cry, By your priesthood, tell me what you are?<br/><br/>Such was the wight; the apparel on his back,<br/>Though coarse, was reverend, and though bare, was black:<br/>The suit, if by the fashion one might guess,<br/>Was velvet in the youth of good Queen Bess,<br/>But mere tuff-taffety what now remain'd;<br/>So time, that changes all things, had ordain'd!<br/>Our sons shall see it leisurely decay,<br/>First turn plain rash, then vanish quite away.<br/><br/>This thing has travell'd, speaks each language too,<br/>And knows what's fit for every State to do;<br/>Of whose best phrase and courtly accent join'd,<br/>He forms one tongue, exotic and refined<br/>Talkers I've learn'd to bear; Motteux I knew,<br/>Henley himself I've heard, and Budgell too.<br/>The Doctor's wormwood style, the hash of tongues<br/>A pedant makes, the storm of Gonson's lungs,<br/>The whole artillery of the terms of war,<br/>And (all those plagues in one) the bawling Bar:<br/>These I could bear; but not a rogue so civil,<br/>Whose tongue will compliment you to the devil;<br/>A tongue, that can cheat widows, cancel scores,<br/>Make Scots speak treason, cozen subtlest whores,<br/>With royal favourites in flattery vie,<br/>And Oldmixon and Burnet both outlie.<br/><br/>He spies me out; I whisper, Gracious God!<br/>What sin of mine could merit such a rod?<br/>That all the shot of dulness now must be<br/>From this thy blunderbuss discharged on me!<br/>Permit (he cries) no stranger to your fame<br/>To crave your sentiment, if ----'s your name.<br/>What speech esteem you most? 'The King's,' said I.<br/>But the best words?--'Oh, sir, the Dictionary.'<br/>You miss my aim; I mean the most acute<br/>And perfect speaker?--'Onslow, past dispute.'<br/>But, sir, of writers? 'Swift, for closer style;<br/>But Hoadley, for a period of a mile.'<br/>Why, yes, 'tis granted, these indeed may pass:<br/>Good common linguists, and so Panurge was;<br/>Nay, troth, the Apostles (though perhaps too rough)<br/>Had once a pretty gift of tongues enough:<br/>Yet these were all poor gentlemen! I dare<br/>Affirm, 'twas travel made them what they were.<br/><br/>Thus others' talents having nicely shown,<br/>He came by sure transition to his own:<br/>Till I cried out, You prove yourself so able,<br/>Pity you was not druggerman at Babel;<br/>For had they found a linguist half so good,<br/>I make no question but the tower had stood.<br/>'Obliging sir! for courts you sure were made:<br/>Why then for ever buried in the shade?<br/>Spirits like you should see, and should be seen,<br/>The king would smile on you--at least the queen.'<br/>Ah, gentle sir! you courtiers so cajole us--<br/>But Tully has it, _Nunquam minus solus_:<br/>And as for courts, forgive me, if I say<br/>No lessons now are taught the Spartan way:<br/>Though in his pictures lust be full display'd,<br/>Few are the converts Aretine has made;<br/>And though the court show vice exceeding clear,<br/>None should, by my advice, learn virtue there.<br/><br/>At this, entranced, he lifts his hands and eyes,<br/>Squeaks like a high-stretch'd lutestring, and replies:<br/>'Oh, 'tis the sweetest of all earthly things<br/>To gaze on princes, and to talk of kings!'<br/>Then, happy man who shows the tombs! said I,<br/>He dwells amidst the royal family;<br/>He every day, from king to king can walk,<br/>Of all our Harries, all our Edwards talk,<br/>And get by speaking truth of monarchs dead,<br/>What few can of the living-ease and bread.<br/>'Lord, sir, a mere mechanic! strangely low,<br/>And coarse of phrase,--your English all are so.<br/>How elegant your Frenchmen!' Mine, d'ye mean?<br/>I have but one, I hope the fellow's clean.<br/>'Oh! sir, politely so! nay, let me die:<br/>Your only wearing is your paduasoy.'<br/>Not, sir, my only, I have better still,<br/>And this, you see, is but my dishabille.<br/>Wild to get loose, his patience I provoke,<br/>Mistake, confound, object at all he spoke.<br/>But as coarse iron, sharpen'd, mangles more,<br/>And itch most hurts when anger'd to a sore;<br/>So when you plague a fool, 'tis still the curse,<br/>You only make the matter worse and worse.<br/><br/>He pass'd it o'er; affects an easy smile<br/>At all my peevishness, and turns his style.<br/>He asks, 'What news?' I tell him of new plays,<br/>New eunuchs, harlequins, and operas.<br/>He hears, and as a still with simples in it<br/>Between each drop it gives, stays half a minute,<br/>Loth to enrich me with too quick replies,<br/>By little, and by little, drops his lies.<br/>Mere household trash! of birthnights, balls, and shows, 130<br/>More than ten Hollinsheds, or Halls, or Stowes.<br/>When the queen frown'd, or smiled, he knows; and what<br/>A subtle minister may make of that:<br/>Who sins with whom: who got his pension rug,<br/>Or quicken'd a reversion by a drug:<br/>Whose place is quarter'd out, three parts in four,<br/>And whether to a bishop, or a whore:<br/>Who, having lost his credit, pawn'd his rent,<br/>Is therefore fit to have a government:<br/>Who, in the secret, deals in stocks secure,<br/>And cheats the unknowing widow and the poor:<br/>Who makes a trust or charity a job,<br/>And gets an act of parliament to rob:<br/>Why turnpikes rise, and now no cit nor clown<br/>Can gratis see the country, or the town:<br/>Shortly no lad shall chuck, or lady vole,<br/>But some excising courtier will have toll.<br/>He tells what strumpet places sells for life,<br/>What 'squire his lands, what citizen his wife:<br/>And last (which proves him wiser still than all)<br/>What lady's face is not a whited wall.<br/><br/>As one of Woodward's patients, sick, and sore,<br/>I puke, I nauseate,--yet he thrusts in more:<br/>Trim's Europe's balance, tops the statesman's part.<br/>And talks Gazettes and Postboys o'er by heart.<br/>Like a big wife at sight of loathsome meat<br/>Ready to cast, I yawn, I sigh, and sweat.<br/>Then as a licensed spy, whom nothing can<br/>Silence or hurt, he libels the great man;<br/>Swears every place entail'd for years to come,<br/>In sure succession to the day of doom:<br/>He names the price for every office paid,<br/>And says our wars thrive ill, because delay'd:<br/>Nay, hints 'tis by connivance of the court<br/>That Spain robs on, and Dunkirk's still a port.<br/>Not more amazement seized on Circe's guests,<br/>To see themselves fall endlong into beasts,<br/>Than mine, to find a subject, staid and wise,<br/>Already half turn'd traitor by surprise.<br/>I felt the infection slide from him to me,<br/>As in the pox, some give it to get free;<br/>And quick to swallow me, methought I saw<br/>One of our giant statues ope its jaw.<br/><br/>In that nice moment, as another lie<br/>Stood just a-tilt, the minister came by.<br/>To him he flies, and bows, and bows again,<br/>Then, close as Umbra, joins the dirty train.<br/>Not Fannius' self more impudently near,<br/>When half his nose is in his prince's ear.<br/>I quaked at heart; and still afraid, to see<br/>All the court fill'd with stranger things than he,<br/>Ran out as fast, as one that pays his bail,<br/>And dreads more actions, hurries from a jail.<br/><br/>Bear me, some god! oh quickly bear me hence<br/>To wholesome solitude, the nurse of sense,<br/>Where Contemplation prunes her ruffled wings,<br/>And the free soul looks down to pity kings!<br/>There sober thought pursued the amusing theme,<br/>Till fancy colour'd it, and form'd a dream.<br/>A vision hermits can to Hell transport,<br/>And forced ev'n me to see the damn'd at court.<br/>Not Dante, dreaming all the infernal state,<br/>Beheld such scenes of envy, sin, and hate.<br/>Base fear becomes the guilty, not the free;<br/>Suits tyrants, plunderers, but suits not me:<br/>Shall I, the terror of this sinful town,<br/>Care if a liveried lord or smile or frown?<br/>Who cannot flatter, and detest who can,<br/>Tremble before a noble serving-man?<br/>O my fair mistress, Truth! shall I quit thee<br/>For huffing, braggart, puff'd nobility?<br/>Thou, who since yesterday hast roll'd o'er all<br/>The busy, idle blockheads of the ball,<br/>Hast thou, O Sun! beheld an emptier sort,<br/>Than such as swell this bladder of a court?<br/>Now pox on those who show a court in wax!<br/>It ought to bring all courtiers on their backs:<br/>Such painted puppets! such a varnish'd race<br/>Of hollow gewgaws, only dress and face!<br/>Such waxen noses, stately staring things--<br/>No wonder some folks bow, and think them kings.<br/><br/>See! where the British youth, engaged no more<br/>At Fig's, at White's, with felons, or a whore,<br/>Pay their last duty to the court, and come<br/>All fresh and fragrant, to the drawing-room;<br/>In hues as gay, and odours as divine,<br/>As the fair fields they sold to look so fine.<br/>'That's velvet for a king!' the flatterer swears;<br/>'Tis true, for ten days hence 'twill be King Lear's.<br/>Our court may justly to our stage give rules,<br/>That helps it both to fools' coats and to fools.<br/>And why not players strut in courtiers' clothes?<br/>For these are actors too, as well as those:<br/>Wants reach all states; they beg, but better dress'd,<br/>And all is splendid poverty at best.<br/><br/>Painted for sight, and essenced for the smell,<br/>Like frigates fraught with spice and cochineal,<br/>Sail in the ladies: how each pirate eyes<br/>So weak a vessel, and so rich a prize!<br/>Top-gallant he, and she in all her trim,<br/>He boarding her, she striking sail to him:<br/>'Dear Countess! you have charms all hearts to hit!'<br/>And, 'Sweet Sir Fopling! you have so much wit!'<br/>Such wits and beauties are not praised for nought,<br/>For both the beauty and the wit are bought.<br/>'Twould burst ev'n Heraclitus with the spleen,<br/>To see those antics, Fopling and Courtin:<br/>The Presence seems, with things so richly odd,<br/>The mosque of Mahound, or some queer pagod.<br/>See them survey their limbs by Durer's rules,<br/>Of all beau-kind the best proportion'd fools!<br/>Adjust their clothes, and to confession draw<br/>Those venial sins, an atom, or a straw;<br/>But oh! what terrors must distract the soul<br/>Convicted of that mortal crime, a hole;<br/>Or should one pound of powder less bespread<br/>Those monkey tails that wag behind their head.<br/>Thus finish'd, and corrected to a hair,<br/>They march, to prate their hour before the fair.<br/>So first to preach a white-gloved chaplain goes,<br/>With band of lily, and with cheek of rose,<br/>Sweeter than Sharon, in immaculate trim,<br/>Neatness itself impertinent in him,<br/>Let but the ladies smile, and they are blest:<br/>Prodigious! how the things protest, protest:<br/>Peace, fools! or Gonson will for Papists seize you,<br/>If once he catch you at your Jesu! Jesu!<br/><br/>Nature made every fop to plague his brother,<br/>Just as one beauty mortifies another.<br/>But here's the captain that will plague them both,<br/>Whose air cries, Arm! whose very look's an oath:<br/>The captain's honest, sirs, and that's enough,<br/>Though his soul's bullet, and his body buff.<br/>He spits fore-right; his haughty chest before,<br/>Like battering rams, beats open every door:<br/>And with a face as red, and as awry,<br/>As Herod's hangdogs in old tapestry,<br/>Scarecrow to boys, the breeding woman's curse,<br/>Has yet a strange ambition to look worse;<br/>Confounds the civil, keeps the rude in awe,<br/>Jests like a licensed fool, commands like law.<br/><br/>Frighted, I quit the room, but leave it so<br/>As men from jails to execution go;<br/>For hung with deadly sins I see the wall,<br/>And lined with giants deadlier than 'em all:<br/>Each man an Ascapart, of strength to toss<br/>For quoits, both Temple-bar and Charing-cross.<br/>Scared at the grisly forms, I sweat, I fly,<br/>And shake all o'er, like a discover'd spy.<br/><br/>Courts are too much for wits so weak as mine:<br/>Charge them with Heaven's artillery, bold divine!<br/>From such alone the great rebukes endure,<br/>Whose satire's sacred, and whose rage secure:<br/>'Tis mine to wash a few light stains, but theirs<br/>To deluge sin, and drown a court in tears.<br/>Howe'er, what's now Apocrypha, my wit,<br/>In time to come, may pass for holy writ.
