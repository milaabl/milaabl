# üíÆ Peter Bell the Third.  by Miching Mallecho, Esq by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    Is it a party in a parlour,<br/>Crammed just as they on earth were crammed,<br/>Some sipping punch--some sipping tea;<br/>But, as you by their faces see,<br/>All silent, and all--damned!<br/>"Peter Bell", by W. WORDSWORTH.<br/><br/>OPHELIA.--What means this, my lord?<br/>HAMLET.--Marry, this is Miching Mallecho; it means mischief.<br/>SHAKESPEARE.<br/><br/>MICHING MALLECHO.<br/><br/>PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>Peter Bells, one, two and three,<br/>O'er the wide world wandering be.--<br/>First, the antenatal Peter,<br/>Wrapped in weeds of the same metre,<br/>The so-long-predestined raiment<br/>Clothed in which to walk his way meant<br/>The second Peter; whose ambition<br/>Is to link the proposition,<br/>As the mean of two extremes--<br/>(This was learned from Aldric's themes)<br/>Shielding from the guilt of schism<br/>The orthodoxal syllogism;<br/>The First Peter--he who was<br/>Like the shadow in the glass<br/>Of the second, yet unripe,<br/>His substantial antitype.--<br/><br/>Then came Peter Bell the Second,<br/>Who henceforward must be reckoned<br/>The body of a double soul,<br/>And that portion of the whole<br/>Without which the rest would seem<br/>Ends of a disjointed dream.--<br/>And the Third is he who has<br/>O'er the grave been forced to pass<br/>To the other side, which is,--<br/>Go and try else,--just like this.<br/><br/>Peter Bell the First was Peter<br/>Smugger, milder, softer, neater,<br/>Like the soul before it is<br/>Born from THAT world into THIS.<br/>The next Peter Bell was he,<br/>Predevote, like you and me,<br/>To good or evil as may come;<br/>His was the severer doom,--<br/>For he was an evil Cotter,<br/>And a polygamic Potter.<br/>And the last is Peter Bell,<br/>Damned since our first parents fell,<br/>Damned eternally to Hell--<br/>Surely he deserves it well!<br/><br/>PART 1.<br/><br/>DEATH.<br/><br/>And Peter Bell, when he had been<br/>With fresh-imported Hell-fire warmed,<br/>Grew serious--from his dress and mien<br/>'Twas very plainly to be seen<br/>Peter was quite reformed.<br/><br/>His eyes turned up, his mouth turned down;<br/>His accent caught a nasal twang;<br/>He oiled his hair; there might be heard<br/>The grace of God in every word<br/>Which Peter said or sang.<br/><br/>But Peter now grew old, and had<br/>An ill no doctor could unravel:<br/>His torments almost drove him mad;--<br/>Some said it was a fever bad--<br/>Some swore it was the gravel.<br/><br/>His holy friends then came about,<br/>And with long preaching and persuasion<br/>Convinced the patient that, without<br/>The smallest shadow of a doubt,<br/>He was predestined to damnation.<br/><br/>They said--'Thy name is Peter Bell;<br/>Thy skin is of a brimstone hue;<br/>Alive or dead--ay, sick or well--<br/>The one God made to rhyme with hell;<br/>The other, I think, rhymes with you.<br/><br/>Then Peter set up such a yell!--<br/>The nurse, who with some water gruel<br/>Was climbing up the stairs, as well<br/>As her old legs could climb them--fell,<br/>And broke them both--the fall was cruel.<br/><br/>The Parson from the casement lept<br/>Into the lake of Windermere--<br/>And many an eel--though no adept<br/>In God's right reason for it--kept<br/>Gnawing his kidneys half a year.<br/><br/>And all the rest rushed through the door<br/>And tumbled over one another,<br/>And broke their skulls.--Upon the floor<br/>Meanwhile sat Peter Bell, and swore,<br/>And cursed his father and his mother;<br/><br/>And raved of God, and sin, and death,<br/>Blaspheming like an infidel;<br/>And said, that with his clenched teeth<br/>He'd seize the earth from underneath,<br/>And drag it with him down to hell.<br/><br/>As he was speaking came a spasm,<br/>And wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder;<br/>Like one who sees a strange phantasm<br/>He lay,--there was a silent chasm<br/>Between his upper jaw and under.<br/><br/>And yellow death lay on his face;<br/>And a fixed smile that was not human<br/>Told, as I understand the case,<br/>That he was gone to the wrong place:--<br/>I heard all this from the old woman.<br/><br/>Then there came down from Langdale Pike<br/>A cloud, with lightning, wind and hail;<br/>It swept over the mountains like<br/>An ocean,--and I heard it strike<br/>The woods and crags of Grasmere vale.<br/><br/>And I saw the black storm come<br/>Nearer, minute after minute;<br/>Its thunder made the cataracts dumb;<br/>With hiss, and clash, and hollow hum,<br/>It neared as if the Devil was in it.<br/><br/>The Devil WAS in it:--he had bought<br/>Peter for half-a-crown; and when<br/>The storm which bore him vanished, nought<br/>That in the house that storm had caught<br/>Was ever seen again.<br/><br/>The gaping neighbours came next day--<br/>They found all vanished from the shore:<br/>The Bible, whence he used to pray,<br/>Half scorched under a hen-coop lay;<br/>Smashed glass--and nothing more!<br/><br/>PART 2.<br/><br/>THE DEVIL.<br/><br/>The Devil, I safely can aver,<br/>Has neither hoof, nor tail, nor sting;<br/>Nor is he, as some sages swear,<br/>A spirit, neither here nor there,<br/>In nothing--yet in everything.<br/><br/>He is--what we are; for sometimes<br/>The Devil is a gentleman;<br/>At others a bard bartering rhymes<br/>For sack; a statesman spinning crimes;<br/>A swindler, living as he can;<br/><br/>A thief, who cometh in the night,<br/>With whole boots and net pantaloons,<br/>Like some one whom it were not right<br/>To mention;--or the luckless wight<br/>From whom he steals nine silver spoons.<br/><br/>But in this case he did appear<br/>Like a slop-merchant from Wapping,<br/>And with smug face, and eye severe,<br/>On every side did perk and peer<br/>Till he saw Peter dead or napping.<br/><br/>He had on an upper Benjamin<br/>(For he was of the driving schism)<br/>In the which he wrapped his skin<br/>From the storm he travelled in,<br/>For fear of rheumatism.<br/><br/>He called the ghost out of the corse;--<br/>It was exceedingly like Peter,--<br/>Only its voice was hollow and hoarse--<br/>It had a queerish look of course--<br/>Its dress too was a little neater.<br/><br/>The Devil knew not his name and lot;<br/>Peter knew not that he was Bell:<br/>Each had an upper stream of thought,<br/>Which made all seem as it was not;<br/>Fitting itself to all things well.<br/><br/>Peter thought he had parents dear,<br/>Brothers, sisters, cousins, cronies,<br/>In the fens of Lincolnshire;<br/>He perhaps had found them there<br/>Had he gone and boldly shown his<br/><br/>Solemn phiz in his own village;<br/>Where he thought oft when a boy<br/>He'd clomb the orchard walls to pillage<br/>The produce of his neighbour's tillage,<br/>With marvellous pride and joy.<br/><br/>And the Devil thought he had,<br/>'Mid the misery and confusion<br/>Of an unjust war, just made<br/>A fortune by the gainful trade<br/>Of giving soldiers rations bad--<br/>The world is full of strange delusion--<br/><br/>That he had a mansion planned<br/>In a square like Grosvenor Square,<br/>That he was aping fashion, and<br/>That he now came to Westmoreland<br/>To see what was romantic there.<br/><br/>And all this, though quite ideal,--<br/>Ready at a breath to vanish,--<br/>Was a state not more unreal<br/>Than the peace he could not feel,<br/>Or the care he could not banish.<br/><br/>After a little conversation,<br/>The Devil told Peter, if he chose,<br/>He'd bring him to the world of fashion<br/>By giving him a situation<br/>In his own service--and new clothes.<br/><br/>And Peter bowed, quite pleased and proud,<br/>And after waiting some few days<br/>For a new livery--dirty yellow<br/>Turned up with black--the wretched fellow<br/>Was bowled to Hell in the Devil's chaise.<br/><br/>PART 3.<br/><br/>HELL.<br/><br/>Hell is a city much like London--<br/>A populous and a smoky city;<br/>There are all sorts of people undone,<br/>And there is little or no fun done;<br/>Small justice shown, and still less pity.<br/><br/>There is a Castles, and a Canning,<br/>A Cobbett, and a Castlereagh;<br/>All sorts of caitiff corpses planning<br/>All sorts of cozening for trepanning<br/>Corpses less corrupt than they.<br/><br/>There is a , who has lost<br/>His wits, or sold them, none knows which;<br/>He walks about a double ghost,<br/>And though as thin as Fraud almost--<br/>Ever grows more grim and rich.<br/><br/>There is a Chancery Court; a King;<br/>A manufacturing mob; a set<br/>Of thieves who by themselves are sent<br/>Similar thieves to represent;<br/>An army; and a public debt.<br/><br/>Which last is a scheme of paper money,<br/>And means--being interpreted--<br/>'Bees, keep your wax--give us the honey,<br/>And we will plant, while skies are sunny,<br/>Flowers, which in winter serve instead.'<br/><br/>There is a great talk of revolution--<br/>And a great chance of despotism--<br/>German soldiers--camps--confusion--<br/>Tumults--lotteries--rage--delusion--<br/>Gin--suicide--and methodism;<br/><br/>Taxes too, on wine and bread,<br/>And meat, and beer, and tea, and cheese,<br/>From which those patriots pure are fed,<br/>Who gorge before they reel to bed<br/>The tenfold essence of all these.<br/><br/>There are mincing women, mewing,<br/>(Like cats, who amant misere,)<br/>Of their own virtue, and pursuing<br/>Their gentler sisters to that ruin,<br/>Without which--what were chastity?(2)<br/><br/>Lawyers--judges--old hobnobbers<br/>Are there--bailiffs--chancellors--<br/>Bishops--great and little robbers--<br/>Rhymesters--pamphleteers--stock-jobbers--<br/>Men of glory in the wars,--<br/><br/>Things whose trade is, over ladies<br/>To lean, and flirt, and stare, and simper,<br/>Till all that is divine in woman<br/>Grows cruel, courteous, smooth, inhuman,<br/>Crucified 'twixt a smile and whimper.<br/><br/>Thrusting, toiling, wailing, moiling,<br/>Frowning, preaching--such a riot!<br/>Each with never-ceasing labour,<br/>Whilst he thinks he cheats his neighbour,<br/>Cheating his own heart of quiet.<br/><br/>And all these meet at levees;--<br/>Dinners convivial and political;--<br/>Suppers of epic poets;--teas,<br/>Where small talk dies in agonies;--<br/>Breakfasts professional and critical;<br/><br/>Lunches and snacks so aldermanic<br/>That one would furnish forth ten dinners,<br/>Where reigns a Cretan-tongued panic,<br/>Lest news Russ, Dutch, or Alemannic<br/>Should make some losers, and some winners--<br/><br/>At conversazioni--balls--<br/>Conventicles--and drawing-rooms--<br/>Courts of law--committees--calls<br/>Of a morning--clubs--book-stalls--<br/>Churches--masquerades--and tombs.<br/><br/>And this is Hell--and in this smother<br/>All are damnable and damned;<br/>Each one damning, damns the other;<br/>They are damned by one another,<br/>By none other are they damned.<br/><br/>'Tis a lie to say, 'God damns'! (1)<br/>Where was Heaven's Attorney General<br/>When they first gave out such flams?<br/>Let there be an end of shams,<br/>They are mines of poisonous mineral.<br/><br/>Statesmen damn themselves to be<br/>Cursed; and lawyers damn their souls<br/>To the auction of a fee;<br/>Churchmen damn themselves to see<br/>God's sweet love in burning coals.<br/><br/>The rich are damned, beyond all cure,<br/>To taunt, and starve, and trample on<br/>The weak and wretched; and the poor<br/>Damn their broken hearts to endure<br/>Stripe on stripe, with groan on groan.<br/><br/>Sometimes the poor are damned indeed<br/>To take,--not means for being blessed,--<br/>But Cobbett's snuff, revenge; that weed<br/>From which the worms that it doth feed<br/>Squeeze less than they before possessed.<br/><br/>And some few, like we know who,<br/>Damned--but God alone knows why--<br/>To believe their minds are given<br/>To make this ugly Hell a Heaven;<br/>In which faith they live and die.<br/><br/>Thus, as in a town, plague-stricken,<br/>Each man be he sound or no<br/>Must indifferently sicken;<br/>As when day begins to thicken,<br/>None knows a pigeon from a crow,--<br/><br/>So good and bad, sane and mad,<br/>The oppressor and the oppressed;<br/>Those who weep to see what others<br/>Smile to inflict upon their brothers;<br/>Lovers, haters, worst and best;<br/><br/>All are damned--they breathe an air,<br/>Thick, infected, joy-dispelling:<br/>Each pursues what seems most fair,<br/>Mining like moles, through mind, and there<br/>Scoop palace-caverns vast, where Care<br/>In throned state is ever dwelling.<br/><br/>PART 4.<br/><br/>SIN.<br/><br/>Lo. Peter in Hell's Grosvenor Square,<br/>A footman in the Devil's service!<br/>And the misjudging world would swear<br/>That every man in service there<br/>To virtue would prefer vice.<br/><br/>But Peter, though now damned, was not<br/>What Peter was before damnation.<br/>Men oftentimes prepare a lot<br/>Which ere it finds them, is not what<br/>Suits with their genuine station.<br/><br/>All things that Peter saw and felt<br/>Had a peculiar aspect to him;<br/>And when they came within the belt<br/>Of his own nature, seemed to melt,<br/>Like cloud to cloud, into him.<br/><br/>And so the outward world uniting<br/>To that within him, he became<br/>Considerably uninviting<br/>To those who, meditation slighting,<br/>Were moulded in a different frame.<br/><br/>And he scorned them, and they scorned him;<br/>And he scorned all they did; and they<br/>Did all that men of their own trim<br/>Are wont to do to please their whim,<br/>Drinking, lying, swearing, play.<br/><br/>Such were his fellow-servants; thus<br/>His virtue, like our own, was built<br/>Too much on that indignant fuss<br/>Hypocrite Pride stirs up in us<br/>To bully one another's guilt.<br/><br/>He had a mind which was somehow<br/>At once circumference and centre<br/>Of all he might or feel or know;<br/>Nothing went ever out, although<br/>Something did ever enter.<br/><br/>He had as much imagination<br/>As a pint-pot;--he never could<br/>Fancy another situation,<br/>From which to dart his contemplation,<br/>Than that wherein he stood.<br/><br/>Yet his was individual mind,<br/>And new created all he saw<br/>In a new manner, and refined<br/>Those new creations, and combined<br/>Them, by a master-spirit's law.<br/><br/>Thus--though unimaginative--<br/>An apprehension clear, intense,<br/>Of his mind's work, had made alive<br/>The things it wrought on; I believe<br/>Wakening a sort of thought in sense.<br/><br/>But from the first 'twas Peter's drift<br/>To be a kind of moral eunuch,<br/>He touched the hem of Nature's shift,<br/>Felt faint--and never dared uplift<br/>The closest, all-concealing tunic.<br/><br/>She laughed the while, with an arch smile,<br/>And kissed him with a sister's kiss,<br/>And said--My best Diogenes,<br/>I love you well--but, if you please,<br/>Tempt not again my deepest bliss.<br/><br/>''Tis you are cold--for I, not coy,<br/>Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;<br/>And Burns, a Scottish peasant boy--<br/>His errors prove it--knew my joy<br/>More, learned friend, than you.<br/><br/>'Boeca bacciata non perde ventura,<br/>Anzi rinnuova come fa la luna:--<br/>So thought Boccaccio, whose sweet words might cure a<br/>Male prude, like you, from what you now endure, a<br/>Low-tide in soul, like a stagnant laguna.<br/><br/>Then Peter rubbed his eyes severe.<br/>And smoothed his spacious forehead down<br/>With his broad palm;--'twixt love and fear,<br/>He looked, as he no doubt felt, queer,<br/>And in his dream sate down.<br/><br/>The Devil was no uncommon creature;<br/>A leaden-witted thief--just huddled<br/>Out of the dross and scum of nature;<br/>A toad-like lump of limb and feature,<br/>With mind, and heart, and fancy muddled.<br/><br/>He was that heavy, dull, cold thing,<br/>The spirit of evil well may be:<br/>A drone too base to have a sting;<br/>Who gluts, and grimes his lazy wing,<br/>And calls lust, luxury.<br/><br/>Now he was quite the kind of wight<br/>Round whom collect, at a fixed aera,<br/>Venison, turtle, hock, and claret,--<br/>Good cheer--and those who come to share it--<br/>And best East Indian madeira!<br/><br/>It was his fancy to invite<br/>Men of science, wit, and learning,<br/>Who came to lend each other light;<br/>He proudly thought that his gold's might<br/>Had set those spirits burning.<br/><br/>And men of learning, science, wit,<br/>Considered him as you and I<br/>Think of some rotten tree, and sit<br/>Lounging and dining under it,<br/>Exposed to the wide sky.<br/><br/>And all the while with loose fat smile,<br/>The willing wretch sat winking there,<br/>Believing 'twas his power that made<br/>That jovial scene--and that all paid<br/>Homage to his unnoticed chair.<br/><br/>Though to be sure this place was Hell;<br/>He was the Devil--and all they--<br/>What though the claret circled well,<br/>And wit, like ocean, rose and fell?--<br/>Were damned eternally.<br/><br/>PART 5.<br/><br/>GRACE.<br/><br/>Among the guests who often stayed<br/>Till the Devil's petits-soupers,<br/>A man there came, fair as a maid,<br/>And Peter noted what he said,<br/>Standing behind his master's chair.<br/><br/>He was a mighty poet--and<br/>A subtle-souled psychologist;<br/>All things he seemed to understand,<br/>Of old or new--of sea or land--<br/>But his own mind--which was a mist.<br/><br/>This was a man who might have turned<br/>Hell into Heaven--and so in gladness<br/>A Heaven unto himself have earned;<br/>But he in shadows undiscerned<br/>Trusted.--and damned himself to madness.<br/><br/>He spoke of poetry, and how<br/>'Divine it was--a light--a love--<br/>A spirit which like wind doth blow<br/>As it listeth, to and fro;<br/>A dew rained down from God above;<br/><br/>'A power which comes and goes like dream,<br/>And which none can ever trace--<br/>Heaven's light on earth--Truth's brightest beam.'<br/>And when he ceased there lay the gleam<br/>Of those words upon his face.<br/><br/>Now Peter, when he heard such talk,<br/>Would, heedless of a broken pate,<br/>Stand like a man asleep, or balk<br/>Some wishing guest of knife or fork,<br/>Or drop and break his master's plate.<br/><br/>At night he oft would start and wake<br/>Like a lover, and began<br/>In a wild measure songs to make<br/>On moor, and glen, and rocky lake,<br/>And on the heart of man--<br/><br/>And on the universal sky--<br/>And the wide earth's bosom green,--<br/>And the sweet, strange mystery<br/>Of what beyond these things may lie,<br/>And yet remain unseen.<br/><br/>For in his thought he visited<br/>The spots in which, ere dead and damned,<br/>He his wayward life had led;<br/>Yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed<br/>Which thus his fancy crammed.<br/><br/>And these obscure remembrances<br/>Stirred such harmony in Peter,<br/>That, whensoever he should please,<br/>He could speak of rocks and trees<br/>In poetic metre.<br/><br/>For though it was without a sense<br/>Of memory, yet he remembered well<br/>Many a ditch and quick-set fence;<br/>Of lakes he had intelligence,<br/>He knew something of heath and fell.<br/><br/>He had also dim recollections<br/>Of pedlars tramping on their rounds;<br/>Milk-pans and pails; and odd collections<br/>Of saws, and proverbs; and reflections<br/>Old parsons make in burying-grounds.<br/><br/>But Peter's verse was clear, and came<br/>Announcing from the frozen hearth<br/>Of a cold age, that none might tame<br/>The soul of that diviner flame<br/>It augured to the Earth:<br/><br/>Like gentle rains, on the dry plains,<br/>Making that green which late was gray,<br/>Or like the sudden moon, that stains<br/>Some gloomy chamber's window-panes<br/>With a broad light like day.<br/><br/>For language was in Peter's hand<br/>Like clay while he was yet a potter;<br/>And he made songs for all the land,<br/>Sweet both to feel and understand,<br/>As pipkins late to mountain Cotter.<br/><br/>And Mr. --, the bookseller,<br/>Gave twenty pounds for some;--then scorning<br/>A footman's yellow coat to wear,<br/>Peter, too proud of heart, I fear,<br/>Instantly gave the Devil warning.<br/><br/>Whereat the Devil took offence,<br/>And swore in his soul a great oath then,<br/>'That for his damned impertinence<br/>He'd bring him to a proper sense<br/>Of what was due to gentlemen!'<br/><br/>PART 6.<br/><br/>DAMNATION.<br/><br/>'O that mine enemy had written<br/>A book!'--cried Job:--a fearful curse,<br/>If to the Arab, as the Briton,<br/>'Twas galling to be critic-bitten:--<br/>The Devil to Peter wished no worse.<br/><br/>When Peter's next new book found vent,<br/>The Devil to all the first Reviews<br/>A copy of it slyly sent,<br/>With five-pound note as compliment,<br/>And this short notice--'Pray abuse.'<br/><br/>Then seriatim, month and quarter,<br/>Appeared such mad tirades.--One said--<br/>'Peter seduced Mrs. Foy's daughter,<br/>Then drowned the mother in Ullswater,<br/>The last thing as he went to bed.'<br/><br/>Another--'Let him shave his head!<br/>Where's Dr. Willis?--Or is he joking?<br/>What does the rascal mean or hope,<br/>No longer imitating Pope,<br/>In that barbarian Shakespeare poking?'<br/><br/>One more, 'Is incest not enough?<br/>And must there be adultery too?<br/>Grace after meat? Miscreant and Liar!<br/>Thief! Blackguard! Scoundrel! Fool! hell-fire<br/>Is twenty times too good for you.<br/><br/>'By that last book of yours WE think<br/>You've double damned yourself to scorn;<br/>We warned you whilst yet on the brink<br/>You stood. From your black name will shrink<br/>The babe that is unborn.'<br/><br/>All these Reviews the Devil made<br/>Up in a parcel, which he had<br/>Safely to Peter's house conveyed.<br/>For carriage, tenpence Peter paid--<br/>Untied them--read them--went half mad.<br/><br/>'What!' cried he, 'this is my reward<br/>For nights of thought, and days, of toil?<br/>Do poets, but to be abhorred<br/>By men of whom they never heard,<br/>Consume their spirits' oil?<br/><br/>'What have I done to them?--and who<br/>IS Mrs. Foy? 'Tis very cruel<br/>To speak of me and Betty so!<br/>Adultery! God defend me! Oh!<br/>I've half a mind to fight a duel.<br/><br/>'Or,' cried he, a grave look collecting,<br/>'Is it my genius, like the moon,<br/>Sets those who stand her face inspecting,<br/>That face within their brain reflecting,<br/>Like a crazed bell-chime, out of tune?'<br/><br/>For Peter did not know the town,<br/>But thought, as country readers do,<br/>For half a guinea or a crown,<br/>He bought oblivion or renown<br/>From God's own voice (1) in a review.<br/><br/>All Peter did on this occasion<br/>Was, writing some sad stuff in prose.<br/>It is a dangerous invasion<br/>When poets criticize; their station<br/>Is to delight, not pose.<br/><br/>The Devil then sent to Leipsic fair<br/>For Born's translation of Kant's book;<br/>A world of words, tail foremost, where<br/>Right--wrong--false--true--and foul--and fair<br/>As in a lottery-wheel are shook.<br/><br/>Five thousand crammed octavo pages<br/>Of German psychologics,--he<br/>Who his furor verborum assuages<br/>Thereon, deserves just seven months' wages<br/>More than will e'er be due to me.<br/><br/>I looked on them nine several days,<br/>And then I saw that they were bad;<br/>A friend, too, spoke in their dispraise,--<br/>He never read them;--with amaze<br/>I found Sir William Drummond had.<br/><br/>When the book came, the Devil sent<br/>It to P. Verbovale (2), Esquire,<br/>With a brief note of compliment,<br/>By that night's Carlisle mail. It went,<br/>And set his soul on fire.<br/><br/>Fire, which ex luce praebens fumum,<br/>Made him beyond the bottom see<br/>Of truth's clear well--when I and you, Ma'am,<br/>Go, as we shall do, subter humum,<br/>We may know more than he.<br/><br/>Now Peter ran to seed in soul<br/>Into a walking paradox;<br/>For he was neither part nor whole,<br/>Nor good, nor bad--nor knave nor fool;<br/>--Among the woods and rocks<br/><br/>Furious he rode, where late he ran,<br/>Lashing and spurring his tame hobby;<br/>Turned to a formal puritan,<br/>A solemn and unsexual man,--<br/>He half believed "White Obi".<br/><br/>This steed in vision he would ride,<br/>High trotting over nine-inch bridges,<br/>With Flibbertigibbet, imp of pride,<br/>Mocking and mowing by his side--<br/>A mad-brained goblin for a guide--<br/>Over corn-fields, gates, and hedges.<br/><br/>After these ghastly rides, he came<br/>Home to his heart, and found from thence<br/>Much stolen of its accustomed flame;<br/>His thoughts grew weak, drowsy, and lame<br/>Of their intelligence.<br/><br/>To Peter's view, all seemed one hue;<br/>He was no Whig, he was no Tory;<br/>No Deist and no Christian he;--<br/>He got so subtle, that to be<br/>Nothing, was all his glory.<br/><br/>One single point in his belief<br/>From his organization sprung,<br/>The heart-enrooted faith, the chief<br/>Ear in his doctrines' blighted sheaf,<br/>That 'Happiness is wrong';<br/><br/>So thought Calvin and Dominic;<br/>So think their fierce successors, who<br/>Even now would neither stint nor stick<br/>Our flesh from off our bones to pick,<br/>If they might 'do their do.'<br/><br/>His morals thus were undermined:--<br/>The old Peter--the hard, old Potter--<br/>Was born anew within his mind;<br/>He grew dull, harsh, sly, unrefined,<br/>As when he tramped beside the Otter. (1)<br/><br/>In the death hues of agony<br/>Lambently flashing from a fish,<br/>Now Peter felt amused to see<br/>Shades like a rainbow's rise and flee,<br/>Mixed with a certain hungry wish(2).<br/><br/>So in his Country's dying face<br/>He looked--and, lovely as she lay,<br/>Seeking in vain his last embrace,<br/>Wailing her own abandoned case,<br/>With hardened sneer he turned away:<br/><br/>And coolly to his own soul said;--<br/>'Do you not think that we might make<br/>A poem on her when she's dead:--<br/>Or, no--a thought is in my head--<br/>Her shroud for a new sheet I'll take:<br/><br/>'My wife wants one.--Let who will bury<br/>This mangled corpse! And I and you,<br/>My dearest Soul, will then make merry,<br/>As the Prince Regent did with Sherry,--'<br/>'Ay--and at last desert me too.'<br/><br/>And so his Soul would not be gay,<br/>But moaned within him; like a fawn<br/>Moaning within a cave, it lay<br/>Wounded and wasting, day by day,<br/>Till all its life of life was gone.<br/><br/>As troubled skies stain waters clear,<br/>The storm in Peter's heart and mind<br/>Now made his verses dark and queer:<br/>They were the ghosts of what they were,<br/>Shaking dim grave-clothes in the wind.<br/><br/>For he now raved enormous folly,<br/>Of Baptisms, Sunday-schools, and Graves,<br/>'Twould make George Colman melancholy<br/>To have heard him, like a male Molly,<br/>Chanting those stupid staves.<br/><br/>Yet the Reviews, who heaped abuse<br/>On Peter while he wrote for freedom,<br/>So soon as in his song they spy<br/>The folly which soothes tyranny,<br/>Praise him, for those who feed 'em.<br/><br/>'He was a man, too great to scan;--<br/>A planet lost in truth's keen rays:--<br/>His virtue, awful and prodigious;--<br/>He was the most sublime, religious,<br/>Pure-minded Poet of these days.'<br/><br/>As soon as he read that, cried Peter,<br/>'Eureka! I have found the way<br/>To make a better thing of metre<br/>Than e'er was made by living creature<br/>Up to this blessed day.'<br/><br/>Then Peter wrote odes to the Devil;--<br/>In one of which he meekly said:<br/>'May Carnage and Slaughter,<br/>Thy niece and thy daughter,<br/>May Rapine and Famine,<br/>Thy gorge ever cramming,<br/>Glut thee with living and dead!<br/><br/>'May Death and Damnation,<br/>And Consternation,<br/>Flit up from Hell with pure intent!<br/>Slash them at Manchester,<br/>Glasgow, Leeds, and Chester;<br/>Drench all with blood from Avon to Trent.<br/><br/>'Let thy body-guard yeomen<br/>Hew down babes and women,<br/>And laugh with bold triumph till Heaven be rent!<br/>When Moloch in Jewry<br/>Munched children with fury,<br/>It was thou, Devil, dining with pure intent. (1)<br/><br/>PART 7.<br/><br/>DOUBLE DAMNATION.<br/><br/>The Devil now knew his proper cue.--<br/>Soon as he read the ode, he drove<br/>To his friend Lord MacMurderchouse's,<br/>A man of interest in both houses,<br/>And said:--'For money or for love,<br/><br/>'Pray find some cure or sinecure;<br/>To feed from the superfluous taxes<br/>A friend of ours--a poet--fewer<br/>Have fluttered tamer to the lure<br/>Than he.' His lordship stands and racks his<br/><br/>Stupid brains, while one might count<br/>As many beads as he had boroughs,--<br/>At length replies; from his mean front,<br/>Like one who rubs out an account,<br/>Smoothing away the unmeaning furrows:<br/><br/>'It happens fortunately, dear Sir,<br/>I can. I hope I need require<br/>No pledge from you, that he will stir<br/>In our affairs;--like Oliver.<br/>That he'll be worthy of his hire.'<br/><br/>These words exchanged, the news sent off<br/>To Peter, home the Devil hied,--<br/>Took to his bed; he had no cough,<br/>No doctor,--meat and drink enough.--<br/>Yet that same night he died.<br/><br/>The Devil's corpse was leaded down;<br/>His decent heirs enjoyed his pelf,<br/>Mourning-coaches, many a one,<br/>Followed his hearse along the town:--<br/>Where was the Devil himself?<br/><br/>When Peter heard of his promotion,<br/>His eyes grew like two stars for bliss:<br/>There was a bow of sleek devotion<br/>Engendering in his back; each motion<br/>Seemed a Lord's shoe to kiss.<br/><br/>He hired a house, bought plate, and made<br/>A genteel drive up to his door,<br/>With sifted gravel neatly laid,--<br/>As if defying all who said,<br/>Peter was ever poor.<br/><br/>But a disease soon struck into<br/>The very life and soul of Peter--<br/>He walked about--slept--had the hue<br/>Of health upon his cheeks--and few<br/>Dug better--none a heartier eater.<br/><br/>And yet a strange and horrid curse<br/>Clung upon Peter, night and day;<br/>Month after month the thing grew worse,<br/>And deadlier than in this my verse<br/>I can find strength to say.<br/><br/>Peter was dull--he was at first<br/>Dull--oh, so dull--so very dull!<br/>Whether he talked, wrote, or rehearsed--<br/>Still with this dulness was he cursed--<br/>Dull--beyond all conception--dull.<br/><br/>No one could read his books--no mortal,<br/>But a few natural friends, would hear him;<br/>The parson came not near his portal;<br/>His state was like that of the immortal<br/>Described by Swift--no man could bear him.<br/><br/>His sister, wife, and children yawned,<br/>With a long, slow, and drear ennui,<br/>All human patience far beyond;<br/>Their hopes of Heaven each would have pawned,<br/>Anywhere else to be.<br/><br/>But in his verse, and in his prose,<br/>The essence of his dulness was<br/>Concentred and compressed so close,<br/>'Twould have made Guatimozin doze<br/>On his red gridiron of brass.<br/><br/>A printer's boy, folding those pages,<br/>Fell slumbrously upon one side;<br/>Like those famed Seven who slept three ages.<br/>To wakeful frenzy's vigil--rages,<br/>As opiates, were the same applied.<br/><br/>Even the Reviewers who were hired<br/>To do the work of his reviewing,<br/>With adamantine nerves, grew tired;--<br/>Gaping and torpid they retired,<br/>To dream of what they should be doing.<br/><br/>And worse and worse, the drowsy curse<br/>Yawned in him, till it grew a pest--<br/>A wide contagious atmosphere,<br/>Creeping like cold through all things near;<br/>A power to infect and to infest.<br/><br/>His servant-maids and dogs grew dull;<br/>His kitten, late a sportive elf;<br/>The woods and lakes, so beautiful,<br/>Of dim stupidity were full.<br/>All grew dull as Peter's self.<br/><br/>The earth under his feet--the springs,<br/>Which lived within it a quick life,<br/>The air, the winds of many wings,<br/>That fan it with new murmurings,<br/>Were dead to their harmonious strife.<br/><br/>The birds and beasts within the wood,<br/>The insects, and each creeping thing,<br/>Were now a silent multitude;<br/>Love's work was left unwrought--no brood<br/>Near Peter's house took wing.<br/><br/>And every neighbouring cottager<br/>Stupidly yawned upon the other:<br/>No jackass brayed; no little cur<br/>Cocked up his ears;--no man would stir<br/>To save a dying mother.<br/><br/>Yet all from that charmed district went<br/>But some half-idiot and half-knave,<br/>Who rather than pay any rent,<br/>Would live with marvellous content,<br/>Over his father's grave.<br/><br/>No bailiff dared within that space,<br/>For fear of the dull charm, to enter;<br/>A man would bear upon his face,<br/>For fifteen months in any case,<br/>The yawn of such a venture.<br/><br/>Seven miles above--below--around--<br/>This pest of dulness holds its sway;<br/>A ghastly life without a sound;<br/>To Peter's soul the spell is bound--<br/>How should it ever pass away?
