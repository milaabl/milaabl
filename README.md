# üíÆ CHARMIDES by *Oscar Wilde*

<p>
    I.<br/><br/>He was a Grecian lad, who coming home<br/>With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily<br/>Stood at his galley's prow, and let the foam<br/>Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,<br/>And holding wave and wind in boy's despite<br/>Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.<br/><br/>Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear<br/>Like a thin thread of gold against the sky,<br/>And hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,<br/>And bade the pilot head her lustily<br/>Against the nor'west gale, and all day long<br/>Held on his way, and marked the rowers' time with measured song.<br/><br/>And when the faint Corinthian hills were red<br/>Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay,<br/>And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,<br/>And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,<br/>And washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold<br/>Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,<br/><br/>And a rich robe stained with the fishers' juice<br/>Which of some swarthy trader he had bought<br/>Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse,<br/>And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,<br/>And by the questioning merchants made his way<br/>Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day<br/><br/>Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,<br/>Clomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet<br/>Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd<br/>Of busy priests, and from some dark retreat<br/>Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring<br/>The firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling<br/><br/>The crackling salt upon the flame, or hang<br/>His studded crook against the temple wall<br/>To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang<br/>Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall;<br/>And then the clear-voiced maidens 'gan to sing,<br/>And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,<br/><br/>A beechen cup brimming with milky foam,<br/>A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery<br/>Of hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb<br/>Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee<br/>Had ceased from building, a black skin of oil<br/>Meet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked<br/>spoil<br/><br/>Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid<br/>To please Athena, and the dappled hide<br/>Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade<br/>Had met the shaft; and then the herald cried,<br/>And from the pillared precinct one by one<br/>Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had<br/>done.<br/><br/>And the old priest put out the waning fires<br/>Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed<br/>For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres<br/>Came fainter on the wind, as down the road<br/>In joyous dance these country folk did pass,<br/>And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.<br/><br/>Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,<br/>And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,<br/>And the rose-petals falling from the wreath<br/>As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,<br/>And seemed to be in some entranced swoon<br/>Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon<br/><br/>Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,<br/>When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,<br/>And flinging wide the cedar-carven door<br/>Beheld an awful image saffron-clad<br/>And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared<br/>From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared<br/><br/>Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled<br/>The Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,<br/>And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,<br/>And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold<br/>In passion impotent, while with blind gaze<br/>The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.<br/><br/>The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp<br/>Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast<br/>The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp<br/>Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast<br/>Divide the folded curtains of the night,<br/>And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.<br/><br/>And guilty lovers in their venery<br/>Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,<br/>Deeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;<br/>And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats<br/>Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,<br/>Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.<br/><br/>For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,<br/>And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,<br/>And the air quaked with dissonant alarums<br/>Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,<br/>And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,<br/>And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.<br/><br/>Ready for death with parted lips he stood,<br/>And well content at such a price to see<br/>That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,<br/>The marvel of that pitiless chastity,<br/>Ah! well content indeed, for never wight<br/>Since Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.<br/><br/>Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air<br/>Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,<br/>And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,<br/>And from his limbs he throw the cloak away;<br/>For whom would not such love make desperate?<br/>And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate<br/><br/>Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,<br/>And bared the breasts of polished ivory,<br/>Till from the waist the peplos falling down<br/>Left visible the secret mystery<br/>Which to no lover will Athena show,<br/>The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of<br/>snow.<br/><br/>Those who have never known a lover's sin<br/>Let them not read my ditty, it will be<br/>To their dull ears so musicless and thin<br/>That they will have no joy of it, but ye<br/>To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,<br/>Ye who have learned who Eros is, - O listen yet awhile.<br/><br/>A little space he let his greedy eyes<br/>Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight<br/>Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,<br/>And then his lips in hungering delight<br/>Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck<br/>He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.<br/><br/>Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,<br/>For all night long he murmured honeyed word,<br/>And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed<br/>Her pale and argent body undisturbed,<br/>And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed<br/>His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.<br/><br/>It was as if Numidian javelins<br/>Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,<br/>And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins<br/>In exquisite pulsation, and the pain<br/>Was such sweet anguish that he never drew<br/>His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.<br/><br/>They who have never seen the daylight peer<br/>Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,<br/>And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear<br/>And worshipped body risen, they for certain<br/>Will never know of what I try to sing,<br/>How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.<br/><br/>The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,<br/>The sign which shipmen say is ominous<br/>Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,<br/>And the low lightening east was tremulous<br/>With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,<br/>Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.<br/><br/>Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast<br/>Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,<br/>And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,<br/>And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran<br/>Like a young fawn unto an olive wood<br/>Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;<br/><br/>And sought a little stream, which well he knew,<br/>For oftentimes with boyish careless shout<br/>The green and crested grebe he would pursue,<br/>Or snare in woven net the silver trout,<br/>And down amid the startled reeds he lay<br/>Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.<br/><br/>On the green bank he lay, and let one hand<br/>Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,<br/>And soon the breath of morning came and fanned<br/>His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly<br/>The tangled curls from off his forehead, while<br/>He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.<br/><br/>And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak<br/>With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,<br/>And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke<br/>Curled through the air across the ripening oats,<br/>And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed<br/>As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.<br/><br/>And when the light-foot mower went afield<br/>Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,<br/>And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,<br/>And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,<br/>Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream<br/>And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,<br/><br/>Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,<br/>'It is young Hylas, that false runaway<br/>Who with a Naiad now would make his bed<br/>Forgetting Herakles,' but others, 'Nay,<br/>It is Narcissus, his own paramour,<br/>Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.'<br/><br/>And when they nearer came a third one cried,<br/>'It is young Dionysos who has hid<br/>His spear and fawnskin by the river side<br/>Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,<br/>And wise indeed were we away to fly:<br/>They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.'<br/><br/>So turned they back, and feared to look behind,<br/>And told the timid swain how they had seen<br/>Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,<br/>And no man dared to cross the open green,<br/>And on that day no olive-tree was slain,<br/>Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,<br/><br/>Save when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail<br/>Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound<br/>Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,<br/>Hoping that he some comrade new had found,<br/>And gat no answer, and then half afraid<br/>Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade<br/><br/>A little girl ran laughing from the farm,<br/>Not thinking of love's secret mysteries,<br/>And when she saw the white and gleaming arm<br/>And all his manlihood, with longing eyes<br/>Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity<br/>Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.<br/><br/>Far off he heard the city's hum and noise,<br/>And now and then the shriller laughter where<br/>The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys<br/>Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,<br/>And now and then a little tinkling bell<br/>As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.<br/><br/>Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,<br/>The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,<br/>In sleek and oily coat the water-rat<br/>Breasting the little ripples manfully<br/>Made for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough<br/>Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the<br/>slough.<br/><br/>On the faint wind floated the silky seeds<br/>As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,<br/>The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds<br/>And flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,<br/>Which scarce had caught again its imagery<br/>Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.<br/><br/>But little care had he for any thing<br/>Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,<br/>And from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing<br/>To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;<br/>Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen<br/>The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.<br/><br/>But when the herdsman called his straggling goats<br/>With whistling pipe across the rocky road,<br/>And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes<br/>Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode<br/>Of coming storm, and the belated crane<br/>Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain<br/><br/>Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,<br/>And from the gloomy forest went his way<br/>Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,<br/>And came at last unto a little quay,<br/>And called his mates aboard, and took his seat<br/>On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping<br/>sheet,<br/><br/>And steered across the bay, and when nine suns<br/>Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,<br/>And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons<br/>To the chaste stars their confessors, or told<br/>Their dearest secret to the downy moth<br/>That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth<br/><br/>Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes<br/>And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked<br/>As though the lading of three argosies<br/>Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,<br/>And darkness straightway stole across the deep,<br/>Sheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,<br/><br/>And the moon hid behind a tawny mask<br/>Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge<br/>Rose the red plume, the huge and horned casque,<br/>The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!<br/>And clad in bright and burnished panoply<br/>Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!<br/><br/>To the dull sailors' sight her loosened looks<br/>Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet<br/>Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,<br/>And, marking how the rising waters beat<br/>Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried<br/>To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side<br/><br/>But he, the overbold adulterer,<br/>A dear profaner of great mysteries,<br/>An ardent amorous idolater,<br/>When he beheld those grand relentless eyes<br/>Laughed loud for joy, and crying out 'I come'<br/>Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.<br/><br/>Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,<br/>One dancer left the circling galaxy,<br/>And back to Athens on her clattering car<br/>In all the pride of venged divinity<br/>Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,<br/>And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.<br/><br/>And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew<br/>With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,<br/>And the old pilot bade the trembling crew<br/>Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen<br/>Close to the stern a dim and giant form,<br/>And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.<br/><br/>And no man dared to speak of Charmides<br/>Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,<br/>And when they reached the strait Symplegades<br/>They beached their galley on the shore, and sought<br/>The toll-gate of the city hastily,<br/>And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.<br/><br/><br/>II.<br/><br/><br/>But some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare<br/>The boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,<br/>And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair<br/>And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;<br/>Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,<br/>And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.<br/><br/>And when he neared his old Athenian home,<br/>A mighty billow rose up suddenly<br/>Upon whose oily back the clotted foam<br/>Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,<br/>And clasping him unto its glassy breast<br/>Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!<br/><br/>Now where Colonos leans unto the sea<br/>There lies a long and level stretch of lawn;<br/>The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee<br/>For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun<br/>Is not afraid, for never through the day<br/>Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.<br/><br/>But often from the thorny labyrinth<br/>And tangled branches of the circling wood<br/>The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth<br/>Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood<br/>Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,<br/>Nor dares to wind his horn, or - else at the first break of day<br/><br/>The Dryads come and throw the leathern ball<br/>Along the reedy shore, and circumvent<br/>Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal<br/>For fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,<br/>And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,<br/>Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.<br/><br/>On this side and on that a rocky cave,<br/>Hung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands<br/>Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave<br/>Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,<br/>As though it feared to be too soon forgot<br/>By the green rush, its playfellow, - and yet, it is a spot<br/><br/>So small, that the inconstant butterfly<br/>Could steal the hoarded money from each flower<br/>Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy<br/>Its over-greedy love, - within an hour<br/>A sailor boy, were he but rude enow<br/>To land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,<br/><br/>Would almost leave the little meadow bare,<br/>For it knows nothing of great pageantry,<br/>Only a few narcissi here and there<br/>Stand separate in sweet austerity,<br/>Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,<br/>And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.<br/><br/>Hither the billow brought him, and was glad<br/>Of such dear servitude, and where the land<br/>Was virgin of all waters laid the lad<br/>Upon the golden margent of the strand,<br/>And like a lingering lover oft returned<br/>To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,<br/><br/>Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,<br/>That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,<br/>Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost<br/>Had withered up those lilies white and red<br/>Which, while the boy would through the forest range,<br/>Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.<br/><br/>And when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,<br/>Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied<br/>The boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,<br/>And feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,<br/>And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade<br/>Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.<br/><br/>Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be<br/>So dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms<br/>Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,<br/>And longed to listen to those subtle charms<br/>Insidious lovers weave when they would win<br/>Some fenced fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin<br/><br/>To yield her treasure unto one so fair,<br/>And lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,<br/>Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,<br/>And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth<br/>Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid<br/>Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,<br/><br/>Returned to fresh assault, and all day long<br/>Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,<br/>And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,<br/>Then frowned to see how froward was the boy<br/>Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,<br/>Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;<br/><br/>Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,<br/>But said, 'He will awake, I know him well,<br/>He will awake at evening when the sun<br/>Hangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel;<br/>This sleep is but a cruel treachery<br/>To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea<br/><br/>Deeper than ever falls the fisher's line<br/>Already a huge Triton blows his horn,<br/>And weaves a garland from the crystalline<br/>And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn<br/>The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,<br/>For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crowned head,<br/><br/>We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,<br/>And a blue wave will be our canopy,<br/>And at our feet the water-snakes will curl<br/>In all their amethystine panoply<br/>Of diamonded mail, and we will mark<br/>The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,<br/><br/>Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold<br/>Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep<br/>His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,<br/>And we will see the painted dolphins sleep<br/>Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks<br/>Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous<br/>flocks.<br/><br/>And tremulous opal-hued anemones<br/>Will wave their purple fringes where we tread<br/>Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies<br/>Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread<br/>The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,<br/>And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.'<br/><br/>But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun<br/>With gaudy pennon flying passed away<br/>Into his brazen House, and one by one<br/>The little yellow stars began to stray<br/>Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed<br/>She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,<br/><br/>And cried, 'Awake, already the pale moon<br/>Washes the trees with silver, and the wave<br/>Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,<br/>The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave<br/>The nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,<br/>And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky<br/>grass.<br/><br/>Nay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,<br/>For in yon stream there is a little reed<br/>That often whispers how a lovely boy<br/>Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,<br/>Who when his cruel pleasure he had done<br/>Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.<br/><br/>Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still<br/>With great Apollo's kisses, and the fir<br/>Whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill<br/>Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher<br/>Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen<br/>The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.<br/><br/>Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,<br/>And every morn a young and ruddy swain<br/>Woos me with apples and with locks of hair,<br/>And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain<br/>By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;<br/>But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove<br/><br/>With little crimson feet, which with its store<br/>Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad<br/>Had stolen from the lofty sycamore<br/>At daybreak, when her amorous comrade had<br/>Flown off in search of berried juniper<br/>Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager<br/><br/>Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency<br/>So constant as this simple shepherd-boy<br/>For my poor lips, his joyous purity<br/>And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy<br/>A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;<br/>For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;<br/><br/>His argent forehead, like a rising moon<br/>Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,<br/>Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon<br/>Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse<br/>For Cytheraea, the first silky down<br/>Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and<br/>brown;<br/><br/>And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds<br/>Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,<br/>And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds<br/>Is in his homestead for the thievish fly<br/>To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead<br/>Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.<br/><br/>And yet I love him not; it was for thee<br/>I kept my love; I knew that thou would'st come<br/>To rid me of this pallid chastity,<br/>Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam<br/>Of all the wide AEgean, brightest star<br/>Of ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!<br/><br/>I knew that thou would'st come, for when at first<br/>The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring<br/>Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst<br/>To myriad multitudinous blossoming<br/>Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons<br/>That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous<br/>tunes<br/><br/>Startled the squirrel from its granary,<br/>And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,<br/>Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy<br/>Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein<br/>Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,<br/>And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.<br/><br/>The trooping fawns at evening came and laid<br/>Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs,<br/>And on my topmost branch the blackbird made<br/>A little nest of grasses for his spouse,<br/>And now and then a twittering wren would light<br/>On a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.<br/><br/>I was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,<br/>Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,<br/>And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase<br/>The timorous girl, till tired out with play<br/>She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,<br/>And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful<br/>snare.<br/><br/>Then come away unto my ambuscade<br/>Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy<br/>For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade<br/>Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify<br/>The dearest rites of love; there in the cool<br/>And green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,<br/><br/>The ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,<br/>For round its rim great creamy lilies float<br/>Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,<br/>Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat<br/>Steered by a dragon-fly, - be not afraid<br/>To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made<br/><br/>For lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,<br/>One arm around her boyish paramour,<br/>Strays often there at eve, and I have seen<br/>The moon strip off her misty vestiture<br/>For young Endymion's eyes; be not afraid,<br/>The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.<br/><br/>Nay if thou will'st, back to the beating brine,<br/>Back to the boisterous billow let us go,<br/>And walk all day beneath the hyaline<br/>Huge vault of Neptune's watery portico,<br/>And watch the purple monsters of the deep<br/>Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.<br/><br/>For if my mistress find me lying here<br/>She will not ruth or gentle pity show,<br/>But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere<br/>Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,<br/>And draw the feathered notch against her breast,<br/>And loose the arched cord; aye, even now upon the quest<br/><br/>I hear her hurrying feet, - awake, awake,<br/>Thou laggard in love's battle! once at least<br/>Let me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake<br/>My parched being with the nectarous feast<br/>Which even gods affect! O come, Love, come,<br/>Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.'<br/><br/>Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees<br/>Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air<br/>Grew conscious of a god, and the grey seas<br/>Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare<br/>Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,<br/>And like a flame a barbed reed flew whizzing down the glade.<br/><br/>And where the little flowers of her breast<br/>Just brake into their milky blossoming,<br/>This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,<br/>Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,<br/>And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,<br/>And dug a long red road, and cleft with winged death her heart.<br/><br/>Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry<br/>On the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,<br/>Sobbing for incomplete virginity,<br/>And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,<br/>And all the pain of things unsatisfied,<br/>And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing<br/>side.<br/><br/>Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,<br/>And very pitiful to see her die<br/>Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known<br/>The joy of passion, that dread mystery<br/>Which not to know is not to live at all,<br/>And yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.<br/><br/>But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,<br/>Who with Adonis all night long had lain<br/>Within some shepherd's hut in Arcady,<br/>On team of silver doves and gilded wain<br/>Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar<br/>From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,<br/><br/>And when low down she spied the hapless pair,<br/>And heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,<br/>Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air<br/>As though it were a viol, hastily<br/>She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,<br/>And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous<br/>doom.<br/><br/>For as a gardener turning back his head<br/>To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows<br/>With careless scythe too near some flower bed,<br/>And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,<br/>And with the flower's loosened loneliness<br/>Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness<br/><br/>Driving his little flock along the mead<br/>Treads down two daffodils, which side by aide<br/>Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede<br/>And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,<br/>Treads down their brimming golden chalices<br/>Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;<br/><br/>Or as a schoolboy tired of his book<br/>Flings himself down upon the reedy grass<br/>And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,<br/>And for a time forgets the hour glass,<br/>Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,<br/>And lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.<br/><br/>And Venus cried, 'It is dread Artemis<br/>Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,<br/>Or else that mightier maid whose care it is<br/>To guard her strong and stainless majesty<br/>Upon the hill Athenian, - alas!<br/>That they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should<br/>pass.'<br/><br/>So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl<br/>In the great golden waggon tenderly<br/>(Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl<br/>Just threaded with a blue vein's tapestry<br/>Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast<br/>Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)<br/><br/>And then each pigeon spread its milky van,<br/>The bright car soared into the dawning sky,<br/>And like a cloud the aerial caravan<br/>Passed over the AEgean silently,<br/>Till the faint air was troubled with the song<br/>From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.<br/><br/>But when the doves had reached their wonted goal<br/>Where the wide stair of orbed marble dips<br/>Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul<br/>Just shook the trembling petals of her lips<br/>And passed into the void, and Venus knew<br/>That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,<br/><br/>And bade her servants carve a cedar chest<br/>With all the wonder of this history,<br/>Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest<br/>Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky<br/>On the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun<br/>Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.<br/><br/>Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere<br/>The morning bee had stung the daffodil<br/>With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair<br/>The waking stag had leapt across the rill<br/>And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept<br/>Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.<br/><br/>And when day brake, within that silver shrine<br/>Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,<br/>Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine<br/>That she whose beauty made Death amorous<br/>Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,<br/>And let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.<br/><br/><br/>III<br/><br/><br/>In melancholy moonless Acheron,<br/>Farm for the goodly earth and joyous day<br/>Where no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun<br/>Weighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May<br/>Chequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,<br/>Where thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,<br/><br/>There by a dim and dark Lethaean well<br/>Young Charmides was lying; wearily<br/>He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,<br/>And with its little rifled treasury<br/>Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,<br/>And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,<br/><br/>When as he gazed into the watery glass<br/>And through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned<br/>His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass<br/>Across the mirror, and a little hand<br/>Stole into his, and warm lips timidly<br/>Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a<br/>sigh.<br/><br/>Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,<br/>And ever nigher still their faces came,<br/>And nigher ever did their young mouths draw<br/>Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,<br/>And longing arms around her neck he cast,<br/>And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,<br/><br/>And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,<br/>And all her maidenhood was his to slay,<br/>And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss<br/>Their passion waxed and waned, - O why essay<br/>To pipe again of love, too venturous reed!<br/>Enough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead.<br/><br/>Too venturous poesy, O why essay<br/>To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings<br/>O'er daring Icarus and bid thy lay<br/>Sleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings<br/>Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,<br/>Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quid!<br/><br/>Enough, enough that he whose life had been<br/>A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,<br/>Could in the loveless land of Hades glean<br/>One scorching harvest from those fields of flame<br/>Where passion walks with naked unshod feet<br/>And is not wounded, - ah! enough that once their lips could meet<br/><br/>In that wild throb when all existences<br/>Seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy<br/>Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress<br/>Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone<br/>Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne<br/>Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.
