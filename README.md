# üíÆ The Irish Avatar by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    Ere the daughter of Brunswick is cold in her grave,<br/>And her ashes still float to their home o'er the tide,<br/>Lo! George the triumphant speeds over the wave,<br/>  To the long-cherished Isle which he loved like his--bride.<br/><br/>True, the great of her bright and brief Era are gone,<br/>  The rain-bow-like Epoch where Freedom could pause<br/>For the few little years, out of centuries won,<br/>  Which betrayed not, or crushed not, or wept not her cause.<br/><br/>True, the chains of the Catholic clank o'er his rags,<br/>  The Castle still stands, and the Senate's no more,<br/>And the Famine which dwelt on her freedomless crags<br/>  Is extending its steps to her desolate shore.<br/><br/>To her desolate shore--where the emigrant stands<br/>  For a moment to gaze ere he flies from his hearth;<br/>Tears fall on his chain, though it drops from his hands,<br/>  For the dungeon he quits is the place of his birth.<br/><br/>But he comes! the Messiah of Royalty comes!<br/>  Like a goodly Leviathan rolled from the waves;<br/>Then receive him as best such an advent becomes,<br/>  With a legion of cooks, and an army of slaves!<br/><br/>He comes in the promise and bloom of threescore,<br/>  To perform in the pageant the Sovereign's part--<br/>But long live the Shamrock, which shadows him o'er!<br/>  Could the Green in his _hat_ be transferred to his _heart!_<br/><br/>Could that long-withered spot but be verdant again,<br/>  And a new spring of noble affections arise--<br/>Then might Freedom forgive thee this dance in thy chain,<br/>  And this shout of thy slavery which saddens the skies.<br/><br/>Is it madness or meanness which clings to thee now?<br/>  Were he God--as he is but the commonest clay,<br/>With scarce fewer wrinkles than sins on his brow--<br/>  Such servile devotion might shame him away.<br/><br/>Aye, roar in his train! let thine orators lash<br/>  Their fanciful spirits to pamper his pride--<br/>Not thus did thy Grattan indignantly flash<br/>  His soul o'er the freedom implored and denied.<br/><br/>Ever glorious Grattan! the best of the good!<br/>  So simple in heart, so sublime in the rest!<br/>With all which Demosthenes wanted endued,<br/>  And his rival, or victor, in all he possessed.<br/><br/>Ere Tully arose in the zenith of Rome,<br/>  Though unequalled, preceded, the task was begun--<br/>But Grattan sprung up like a god from the tomb<br/>  Of ages, the first, last, the saviour, the _one!_<br/><br/>With the skill of an Orpheus to soften the brute;<br/>  With the fire of Prometheus to kindle mankind;<br/>Even Tyranny, listening, sate melted or mute,<br/>  And Corruption shrunk scorched from the glance of his mind.<br/><br/>But back to our theme! Back to despots and slaves!<br/>  Feasts furnished by Famine! rejoicings by Pain!<br/>True Freedom but _welcomes_, while Slavery still _raves_,<br/>  When a week's Saturnalia hath loosened her chain.<br/><br/>Let the poor squalid splendour thy wreck can afford,<br/>  (As the bankrupt's profusion his ruin would hide)<br/>Gild over the palace, Lo! Erin, thy Lord!<br/>  Kiss his foot with thy blessing--his blessings denied!<br/><br/>Or _if_ freedom past hope be extorted at last,<br/>  If the idol of brass find his feet are of clay,<br/>Must what terror or policy wring forth be classed<br/>  With what monarchs ne'er give, but as wolves yield their prey?<br/><br/>Each brute hath its nature; a King's is to _reign_,--<br/>  To _reign!_ in that word see, ye ages, comprised<br/>The cause of the curses all annals contain,<br/>  From C√¶sar the dreaded to George the despised!<br/><br/>Wear, Fingal, thy trapping! O'Connell, proclaim<br/>  His accomplishments! _His!!!_ and thy country convince<br/>Half an age's contempt was an error of fame,<br/>  And that "Hal is the rascaliest, sweetest _young_ prince!"<br/><br/>Will thy yard of blue riband, poor Fingal, recall<br/>  The fetters from millions of Catholic limbs?<br/>Or, has it not bound thee the fastest of all<br/>  The slaves, who now hail their betrayer with hymns?<br/><br/>Aye! "Build him a dwelling!" let each give his mite!<br/>  Till, like Babel, the new royal dome hath arisen!<br/>Let thy beggars and helots their pittance unite--<br/>  And a palace bestow for a poor-house and prison!<br/><br/>Spread--spread for Vitellius, the royal repast,<br/>  Till the gluttonous despot be stuffed to the gorge!<br/>And the roar of his drunkards proclaim him at last<br/>  The Fourth of the fools and oppressors called "George!"<br/><br/>Let the tables be loaded with feasts till they groan!<br/>  Till they _groan_ like thy people, through ages of woe!<br/>Let the wine flow around the old Bacchanal's throne,<br/>  Like their blood which has flowed, and which yet has to flow.<br/><br/>But let not _his_ name be thine idol alone--<br/>  On his right hand behold a Sejanus appears!<br/>Thine own Castlereagh! let him still be thine own!<br/>  A wretch never named but with curses and jeers!<br/><br/>Till now, when the Isle which should blush for his birth,<br/>  Deep, deep as the gore which he shed on her soil,<br/>Seems proud of the reptile which crawled from her earth,<br/>  And for murder repays him with shouts and a smile.<br/><br/>Without one single ray of her genius,--without<br/>  The fancy, the manhood, the fire of her race--<br/>The miscreant who well might plunge Erin in doubt<br/>  If _she_ ever gave birth to a being so base.<br/><br/>If she did--let her long-boasted proverb be hushed,<br/>  Which proclaims that from Erin no reptile can spring--<br/>See the cold-blooded Serpent, with venom full flushed,<br/>  Still warming its folds in the breast of a King!<br/><br/>Shout, drink, feast, and flatter! Oh! Erin, how low<br/>  Wert thou sunk by misfortune and tyranny, till<br/>Thy welcome of tyrants hath plunged thee below<br/>  The depth of thy deep in a deeper gulf still.<br/><br/>My voice, though but humble, was raised for thy right;<br/>  My vote, as a freeman's, still voted thee free;<br/>This hand, though but feeble, would arm in thy fight,<br/>  And this heart, though outworn, had a throb still for _thee!_<br/><br/>Yes, I loved thee and thine, though thou art not my land;<br/>  I have known noble hearts and great souls in thy sons,<br/>And I wept with the world, o'er the patriot band<br/>  Who are gone, but I weep them no longer as once.<br/><br/>For happy are they now reposing afar,--<br/>  Thy Grattan, thy Curran, thy Sheridan, all<br/>Who, for years, were the chiefs in the eloquent war,<br/>  And redeemed, if they have not retarded, thy fall.<br/><br/>Yes, happy are they in their cold English graves!<br/>  Their shades cannot start to thy shouts of to-day--<br/>Nor the steps of enslavers and chain-kissing slaves<br/>  Be stamped in the turf o'er their fetterless clay.<br/><br/>Till now I had envied thy sons and their shore,<br/>  Though their virtues were hunted, their liberties fled;<br/>There was something so warm and sublime in the core<br/>  Of an Irishman's heart, that I envy--thy _dead_.<br/><br/>Or, if aught in my bosom can quench for an hour<br/>  My contempt for a nation so servile, though sore,<br/>Which though trod like the worm will not turn upon power,<br/>  'Tis the glory of Grattan, and genius of Moore!
</p>
