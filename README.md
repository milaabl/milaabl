  <summary>📚 <strong>A random poem from <em>https://poetrydb.org/random</em>!</strong> 👇 </summary>

<!-- Start poem -->
# 💮 The Spell Is Broke, the Charm Is Flown! by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    The spell is broke, the charm is flown!<br/>  Thus is it with Life's fitful fever:<br/>We madly smile when we should groan;<br/>  Delirium is our best deceiver.<br/>Each lucid interval of thought<br/>  Recalls the woes of Nature's charter;<br/>And _He_ that acts as _wise men ought_,<br/>  But _lives_--as Saints have died--a martyr.
</p>

⭐ Star the [readme-mosaic](https://github.com/milaabl/readme-mosaic) repo for your 🐈‍⬛ avatar to be included in the next picture redrawing. The more users star the repo, the more realistic the picture will look like because the colors will get more diverse. It's a Python workflow. The author of the painting above is Arkhip Kuindzhi — a Ukrainian painter 💙💛.
