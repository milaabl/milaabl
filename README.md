# üíÆ Paradise Lost: Book 06 by *John Milton*

<p>
    All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,<br/>Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn,<br/>Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand<br/>Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave<br/>Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,<br/>Where light and darkness in perpetual round<br/>Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven<br/>Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;<br/>Light issues forth, and at the other door<br/>Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour<br/>To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well<br/>Seem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn<br/>Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold<br/>Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,<br/>Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain<br/>Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,<br/>Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,<br/>Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:<br/>War he perceived, war in procinct; and found<br/>Already known what he for news had thought<br/>To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed<br/>Among those friendly Powers, who him received<br/>With joy and acclamations loud, that one,<br/>That of so many myriads fallen, yet one<br/>Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill<br/>They led him high applauded, and present<br/>Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,<br/>From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.<br/>Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought<br/>The better fight, who single hast maintained<br/>Against revolted multitudes the cause<br/>Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;<br/>And for the testimony of truth hast borne<br/>Universal reproach, far worse to bear<br/>Than violence; for this was all thy care<br/>To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds<br/>Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now<br/>Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,<br/>Back on thy foes more glorious to return,<br/>Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue<br/>By force, who reason for their law refuse,<br/>Right reason for their law, and for their King<br/>Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.<br/>Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,<br/>And thou, in military prowess next,<br/>Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons<br/>Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,<br/>By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,<br/>Equal in number to that Godless crew<br/>Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms<br/>Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven<br/>Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,<br/>Into their place of punishment, the gulf<br/>Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide<br/>His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.<br/>So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began<br/>To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll<br/>In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign<br/>Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud<br/>Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:<br/>At which command the Powers militant,<br/>That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined<br/>Of union irresistible, moved on<br/>In silence their bright legions, to the sound<br/>Of instrumental harmony, that breathed<br/>Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds<br/>Under their God-like leaders, in the cause<br/>Of God and his Messiah.  On they move<br/>Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,<br/>Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides<br/>Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground<br/>Their march was, and the passive air upbore<br/>Their nimble tread; as when the total kind<br/>Of birds, in orderly array on wing,<br/>Came summoned over Eden to receive<br/>Their names of thee; so over many a tract<br/>Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,<br/>Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last,<br/>Far in the horizon to the north appeared<br/>From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched<br/>In battailous aspect, and nearer view<br/>Bristled with upright beams innumerable<br/>Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields<br/>Various, with boastful argument portrayed,<br/>The banded Powers of Satan hasting on<br/>With furious expedition; for they weened<br/>That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,<br/>To win the mount of God, and on his throne<br/>To set the Envier of his state, the proud<br/>Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain<br/>In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed<br/>At first, that Angel should with Angel war,<br/>And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet<br/>So oft in festivals of joy and love<br/>Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,<br/>Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout<br/>Of battle now began, and rushing sound<br/>Of onset ended soon each milder thought.<br/>High in the midst, exalted as a God,<br/>The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,<br/>Idol of majesty divine, enclosed<br/>With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;<br/>Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now<br/>"twixt host and host but narrow space was left,<br/>A dreadful interval, and front to front<br/>Presented stood in terrible array<br/>Of hideous length:  Before the cloudy van,<br/>On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,<br/>Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,<br/>Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;<br/>Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood<br/>Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,<br/>And thus his own undaunted heart explores.<br/>O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest<br/>Should yet remain, where faith and realty<br/>Remain not:  Wherefore should not strength and might<br/>There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove<br/>Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?<br/>His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,<br/>I mean to try, whose reason I have tried<br/>Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,<br/>That he, who in debate of truth hath won,<br/>Should win in arms, in both disputes alike<br/>Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,<br/>When reason hath to deal with force, yet so<br/>Most reason is that reason overcome.<br/>So pondering, and from his armed peers<br/>Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met<br/>His daring foe, at this prevention more<br/>Incensed, and thus securely him defied.<br/>Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached<br/>The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,<br/>The throne of God unguarded, and his side<br/>Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power<br/>Or potent tongue:  Fool!not to think how vain<br/>Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;<br/>Who out of smallest things could, without end,<br/>Have raised incessant armies to defeat<br/>Thy folly; or with solitary hand<br/>Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,<br/>Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed<br/>Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest<br/>All are not of thy train; there be, who faith<br/>Prefer, and piety to God, though then<br/>To thee not visible, when I alone<br/>Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent<br/>From all:  My sect thou seest;now learn too late<br/>How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.<br/>Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,<br/>Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour<br/>Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest<br/>From flight, seditious Angel! to receive<br/>Thy merited reward, the first assay<br/>Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,<br/>Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose<br/>A third part of the Gods, in synod met<br/>Their deities to assert; who, while they feel<br/>Vigour divine within them, can allow<br/>Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comest<br/>Before thy fellows, ambitious to win<br/>From me some plume, that thy success may show<br/>Destruction to the rest:  This pause between,<br/>(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,<br/>At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven<br/>To heavenly souls had been all one; but now<br/>I see that most through sloth had rather serve,<br/>Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!<br/>Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,<br/>Servility with freedom to contend,<br/>As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.<br/>To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.<br/>Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find<br/>Of erring, from the path of truth remote:<br/>Unjustly thou depravest it with the name<br/>Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,<br/>Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same,<br/>When he who rules is worthiest, and excels<br/>Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,<br/>To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled<br/>Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,<br/>Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;<br/>Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.<br/>Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve<br/>In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine<br/>Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;<br/>Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while<br/>From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,<br/>This greeting on thy impious crest receive.<br/>So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,<br/>Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell<br/>On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,<br/>Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,<br/>Such ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge<br/>He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee<br/>His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth<br/>Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,<br/>Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,<br/>Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised<br/>The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see<br/>Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,<br/>Presage of victory, and fierce desire<br/>Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound<br/>The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven<br/>It sounded, and the faithful armies rung<br/>Hosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze<br/>The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined<br/>The horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose,<br/>And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now<br/>Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed<br/>Horrible discord, and the madding wheels<br/>Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise<br/>Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss<br/>Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,<br/>And flying vaulted either host with fire.<br/>So under fiery cope together rushed<br/>Both battles main, with ruinous assault<br/>And inextinguishable rage.  All Heaven<br/>Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth<br/>Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when<br/>Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought<br/>On either side, the least of whom could wield<br/>These elements, and arm him with the force<br/>Of all their regions:  How much more of power<br/>Army against army numberless to raise<br/>Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,<br/>Though not destroy, their happy native seat;<br/>Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,<br/>From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled<br/>And limited their might; though numbered such<br/>As each divided legion might have seemed<br/>A numerous host; in strength each armed hand<br/>A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed<br/>Each warriour single as in chief, expert<br/>When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway<br/>Of battle, open when, and when to close<br/>The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight,<br/>None of retreat, no unbecoming deed<br/>That argued fear; each on himself relied,<br/>As only in his arm the moment lay<br/>Of victory:  Deeds of eternal fame<br/>Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread<br/>That war and various; sometimes on firm ground<br/>A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,<br/>Tormented all the air; all air seemed then<br/>Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale<br/>The battle hung; till Satan, who that day<br/>Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms<br/>No equal, ranging through the dire attack<br/>Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length<br/>Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled<br/>Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway<br/>Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down<br/>Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand<br/>He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb<br/>Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,<br/>A vast circumference.  At his approach<br/>The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil<br/>Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end<br/>Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued<br/>Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown<br/>And visage all inflamed first thus began.<br/>Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,<br/>Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest<br/>These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,<br/>Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,<br/>And thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed<br/>Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought<br/>Misery, uncreated till the crime<br/>Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled<br/>Thy malice into thousands, once upright<br/>And faithful, now proved false!  But think not here<br/>To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out<br/>From all her confines.  Heaven, the seat of bliss,<br/>Brooks not the works of violence and war.<br/>Hence then, and evil go with thee along,<br/>Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;<br/>Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,<br/>Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,<br/>Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,<br/>Precipitate thee with augmented pain.<br/>So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus<br/>The Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind<br/>Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds<br/>Thou canst not.  Hast thou turned the least of these<br/>To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise<br/>Unvanquished, easier to transact with me<br/>That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats<br/>To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end<br/>The strife which thou callest evil, but we style<br/>The strife of glory; which we mean to win,<br/>Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell<br/>Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,<br/>If not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force,<br/>And join him named Almighty to thy aid,<br/>I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.<br/>They ended parle, and both addressed for fight<br/>Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue<br/>Of Angels, can relate, or to what things<br/>Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift<br/>Human imagination to such highth<br/>Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,<br/>Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,<br/>Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.<br/>Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air<br/>Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields<br/>Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood<br/>In horrour:  From each hand with speed retired,<br/>Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,<br/>And left large field, unsafe within the wind<br/>Of such commotion; such as, to set forth<br/>Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke,<br/>Among the constellations war were sprung,<br/>Two planets, rushing from aspect malign<br/>Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky<br/>Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.<br/>Together both with next to almighty arm<br/>Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed<br/>That might determine, and not need repeat,<br/>As not of power at once; nor odds appeared<br/>In might or swift prevention:  But the sword<br/>Of Michael from the armoury of God<br/>Was given him tempered so, that neither keen<br/>Nor solid might resist that edge: it met<br/>The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite<br/>Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,<br/>But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared<br/>All his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain,<br/>And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore<br/>The griding sword with discontinuous wound<br/>Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed,<br/>Not long divisible; and from the gash<br/>A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed<br/>Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,<br/>And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.<br/>Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run<br/>By Angels many and strong, who interposed<br/>Defence, while others bore him on their shields<br/>Back to his chariot, where it stood retired<br/>From off the files of war:  There they him laid<br/>Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,<br/>To find himself not matchless, and his pride<br/>Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath<br/>His confidence to equal God in power.<br/>Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout<br/>Vital in every part, not as frail man<br/>In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,<br/>Cannot but by annihilating die;<br/>Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound<br/>Receive, no more than can the fluid air:<br/>All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,<br/>All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,<br/>They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size<br/>Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare.<br/>Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved<br/>Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,<br/>And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array<br/>Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,<br/>And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound<br/>Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven<br/>Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon<br/>Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms<br/>And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing<br/>Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,<br/>Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,<br/>Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,<br/>Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods<br/>Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,<br/>Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.<br/>Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy<br/>The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow<br/>Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence<br/>Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.<br/>I might relate of thousands, and their names<br/>Eternize here on earth; but those elect<br/>Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,<br/>Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort,<br/>In might though wonderous and in acts of war,<br/>Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom<br/>Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,<br/>Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.<br/>For strength from truth divided, and from just,<br/>Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise<br/>And ignominy; yet to glory aspires<br/>Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:<br/>Therefore eternal silence be their doom.<br/>And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,<br/>With many an inroad gored; deformed rout<br/>Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground<br/>With shivered armour strown, and on a heap<br/>Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,<br/>And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled<br/>O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host<br/>Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,<br/>Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,<br/>Fled ignominious, to such evil brought<br/>By sin of disobedience; till that hour<br/>Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.<br/>Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,<br/>In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,<br/>Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;<br/>Such high advantages their innocence<br/>Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,<br/>Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood<br/>Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained<br/>By wound, though from their place by violence moved,<br/>Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven<br/>Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,<br/>And silence on the odious din of war:<br/>Under her cloudy covert both retired,<br/>Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten field<br/>Michael and his Angels prevalent<br/>Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,<br/>Cherubick waving fires:  On the other part,<br/>Satan with his rebellious disappeared,<br/>Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,<br/>His potentates to council called by night;<br/>And in the midst thus undismayed began.<br/>O now in danger tried, now known in arms<br/>Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,<br/>Found worthy not of liberty alone,<br/>Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,<br/>Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;<br/>Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,<br/>(And if one day, why not eternal days?)<br/>What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send<br/>Against us from about his throne, and judged<br/>Sufficient to subdue us to his will,<br/>But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems,<br/>Of future we may deem him, though till now<br/>Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,<br/>Some disadvantage we endured and pain,<br/>Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;<br/>Since now we find this our empyreal form<br/>Incapable of mortal injury,<br/>Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,<br/>Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.<br/>Of evil then so small as easy think<br/>The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,<br/>Weapons more violent, when next we meet,<br/>May serve to better us, and worse our foes,<br/>Or equal what between us made the odds,<br/>In nature none:  If other hidden cause<br/>Left them superiour, while we can preserve<br/>Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,<br/>Due search and consultation will disclose.<br/>He sat; and in the assembly next upstood<br/>Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;<br/>As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,<br/>Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,<br/>And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.<br/>Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free<br/>Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard<br/>For Gods, and too unequal work we find,<br/>Against unequal arms to fight in pain,<br/>Against unpained, impassive; from which evil<br/>Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails<br/>Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain<br/>Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands<br/>Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well<br/>Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,<br/>But live content, which is the calmest life:<br/>But pain is perfect misery, the worst<br/>Of evils, and, excessive, overturns<br/>All patience.  He, who therefore can invent<br/>With what more forcible we may offend<br/>Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm<br/>Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves<br/>No less than for deliverance what we owe.<br/>Whereto with look composed Satan replied.<br/>Not uninvented that, which thou aright<br/>Believest so main to our success, I bring.<br/>Which of us who beholds the bright surface<br/>Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand,<br/>This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned<br/>With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;<br/>Whose eye so superficially surveys<br/>These things, as not to mind from whence they grow<br/>Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,<br/>Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched<br/>With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth<br/>So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?<br/>These in their dark nativity the deep<br/>Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;<br/>Which, into hollow engines, long and round,<br/>Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire<br/>Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth<br/>From far, with thundering noise, among our foes<br/>Such implements of mischief, as shall dash<br/>To pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands<br/>Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed<br/>The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.<br/>Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,<br/>Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;<br/>Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined<br/>Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.<br/>He ended, and his words their drooping cheer<br/>Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.<br/>The invention all admired, and each, how he<br/>To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed<br/>Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought<br/>Impossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race<br/>In future days, if malice should abound,<br/>Some one intent on mischief, or inspired<br/>With devilish machination, might devise<br/>Like instrument to plague the sons of men<br/>For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.<br/>Forthwith from council to the work they flew;<br/>None arguing stood; innumerable hands<br/>Were ready; in a moment up they turned<br/>Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath<br/>The originals of nature in their crude<br/>Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam<br/>They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,<br/>Concocted and adusted they reduced<br/>To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:<br/>Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth<br/>Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,<br/>Whereof to found their engines and their balls<br/>Of missive ruin; part incentive reed<br/>Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.<br/>So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,<br/>Secret they finished, and in order set,<br/>With silent circumspection, unespied.<br/>Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,<br/>Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms<br/>The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood<br/>Of golden panoply, refulgent host,<br/>Soon banded; others from the dawning hills<br/>Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,<br/>Each quarter to descry the distant foe,<br/>Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,<br/>In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met<br/>Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow<br/>But firm battalion; back with speediest sail<br/>Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,<br/>Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.<br/>Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,<br/>Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit<br/>This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud<br/>He comes, and settled in his face I see<br/>Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each<br/>His adamantine coat gird well, and each<br/>Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,<br/>Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,<br/>If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,<br/>But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.<br/>So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon<br/>In order, quit of all impediment;<br/>Instant without disturb they took alarm,<br/>And onward moved embattled:  When behold!<br/>Not distant far with heavy pace the foe<br/>Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube<br/>Training his devilish enginery, impaled<br/>On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,<br/>To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood<br/>A while; but suddenly at head appeared<br/>Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.<br/>Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;<br/>That all may see who hate us, how we seek<br/>Peace and composure, and with open breast<br/>Stand ready to receive them, if they like<br/>Our overture; and turn not back perverse:<br/>But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!<br/>Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge<br/>Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand<br/>Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch<br/>What we propound, and loud that all may hear!<br/>So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce<br/>Had ended; when to right and left the front<br/>Divided, and to either flank retired:<br/>Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,<br/>A triple mounted row of pillars laid<br/>On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,<br/>Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,<br/>With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)<br/>Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths<br/>With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,<br/>Portending hollow truce:  At each behind<br/>A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed<br/>Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,<br/>Collected stood within our thoughts amused,<br/>Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds<br/>Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied<br/>With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,<br/>But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,<br/>From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar<br/>Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,<br/>And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul<br/>Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail<br/>Of iron globes; which, on the victor host<br/>Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,<br/>That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,<br/>Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell<br/>By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;<br/>The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might<br/>Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift<br/>By quick contraction or remove; but now<br/>Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;<br/>Nor served it to relax their serried files.<br/>What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse<br/>Repeated, and indecent overthrow<br/>Doubled, would render them yet more despised,<br/>And to their foes a laughter; for in view<br/>Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,<br/>In posture to displode their second tire<br/>Of thunder:  Back defeated to return<br/>They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,<br/>And to his mates thus in derision called.<br/>O Friends! why come not on these victors proud<br/>Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,<br/>To entertain them fair with open front<br/>And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms<br/>Of composition, straight they changed their minds,<br/>Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,<br/>As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed<br/>Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps<br/>For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose,<br/>If our proposals once again were heard,<br/>We should compel them to a quick result.<br/>To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.<br/>Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,<br/>Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;<br/>Such as we might perceive amused them all,<br/>And stumbled many:  Who receives them right,<br/>Had need from head to foot well understand;<br/>Not understood, this gift they have besides,<br/>They show us when our foes walk not upright.<br/>So they among themselves in pleasant vein<br/>Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond<br/>All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might<br/>To match with their inventions they presumed<br/>So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,<br/>And all his host derided, while they stood<br/>A while in trouble:  But they stood not long;<br/>Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms<br/>Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.<br/>Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,<br/>Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)<br/>Their arms away they threw, and to the hills<br/>(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven<br/>Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)<br/>Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;<br/>From their foundations loosening to and fro,<br/>They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,<br/>Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops<br/>Up-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze,<br/>Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,<br/>When coming towards them so dread they saw<br/>The bottom of the mountains upward turned;<br/>Till on those cursed engines' triple-row<br/>They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence<br/>Under the weight of mountains buried deep;<br/>Themselves invaded next, and on their heads<br/>Main promontories flung, which in the air<br/>Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;<br/>Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised<br/>Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain<br/>Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;<br/>Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind<br/>Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,<br/>Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.<br/>The rest, in imitation, to like arms<br/>Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:<br/>So hills amid the air encountered hills,<br/>Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;<br/>That under ground they fought in dismal shade;<br/>Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game<br/>To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped<br/>Upon confusion rose:  And now all Heaven<br/>Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;<br/>Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits<br/>Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,<br/>Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen<br/>This tumult, and permitted all, advised:<br/>That his great purpose he might so fulfil,<br/>To honour his anointed Son avenged<br/>Upon his enemies, and to declare<br/>All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son,<br/>The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.<br/>Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,<br/>Son, in whose face invisible is beheld<br/>Visibly, what by Deity I am;<br/>And in whose hand what by decree I do,<br/>Second Omnipotence! two days are past,<br/>Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,<br/>Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame<br/>These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight,<br/>As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;<br/>For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,<br/>Equal in their creation they were formed,<br/>Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought<br/>Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;<br/>Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last<br/>Endless, and no solution will be found:<br/>War wearied hath performed what war can do,<br/>And to disordered rage let loose the reins<br/>With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes<br/>Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.<br/>Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;<br/>For thee I have ordained it; and thus far<br/>Have suffered, that the glory may be thine<br/>Of ending this great war, since none but Thou<br/>Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace<br/>Immense I have transfused, that all may know<br/>In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;<br/>And, this perverse commotion governed thus,<br/>To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir<br/>Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King<br/>By sacred unction, thy deserved right.<br/>Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;<br/>Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels<br/>That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,<br/>My bow and thunder, my almighty arms<br/>Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;<br/>Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out<br/>From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:<br/>There let them learn, as likes them, to despise<br/>God, and Messiah his anointed King.<br/>He said, and on his Son with rays direct<br/>Shone full; he all his Father full expressed<br/>Ineffably into his face received;<br/>And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.<br/>O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,<br/>First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st<br/>To glorify thy Son, I always thee,<br/>As is most just:  This I my glory account,<br/>My exaltation, and my whole delight,<br/>That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will<br/>Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.<br/>Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,<br/>And gladlier shall resign, when in the end<br/>Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee<br/>For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:<br/>But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on<br/>Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,<br/>Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,<br/>Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;<br/>To their prepared ill mansion driven down,<br/>To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;<br/>That from thy just obedience could revolt,<br/>Whom to obey is happiness entire.<br/>Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure<br/>Far separate, circling thy holy mount,<br/>Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,<br/>Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.<br/>So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose<br/>From the right hand of Glory where he sat;<br/>And the third sacred morn began to shine,<br/>Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound<br/>The chariot of Paternal Deity,<br/>Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,<br/>Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed<br/>By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each<br/>Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all<br/>And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels<br/>Of beryl, and careering fires between;<br/>Over their heads a crystal firmament,<br/>Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure<br/>Amber, and colours of the showery arch.<br/>He, in celestial panoply all armed<br/>Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,<br/>Ascended; at his right hand Victory<br/>Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow<br/>And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;<br/>And from about him fierce effusion rolled<br/>Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:<br/>Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,<br/>He onward came; far off his coming shone;<br/>And twenty thousand (I their number heard)<br/>Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;<br/>He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime<br/>On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,<br/>Illustrious far and wide; but by his own<br/>First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,<br/>When the great ensign of Messiah blazed<br/>Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;<br/>Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced<br/>His army, circumfused on either wing,<br/>Under their Head imbodied all in one.<br/>Before him Power Divine his way prepared;<br/>At his command the uprooted hills retired<br/>Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went<br/>Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,<br/>And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.<br/>This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,<br/>And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,<br/>Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.<br/>In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?<br/>But to convince the proud what signs avail,<br/>Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?<br/>They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,<br/>Grieving to see his glory, at the sight<br/>Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,<br/>Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud<br/>Weening to prosper, and at length prevail<br/>Against God and Messiah, or to fall<br/>In universal ruin last; and now<br/>To final battle drew, disdaining flight,<br/>Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God<br/>To all his host on either hand thus spake.<br/>Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,<br/>Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:<br/>Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God<br/>Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;<br/>And as ye have received, so have ye done,<br/>Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew<br/>The punishment to other hand belongs;<br/>Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:<br/>Number to this day's work is not ordained,<br/>Nor multitude; stand only, and behold<br/>God's indignation on these godless poured<br/>By me; not you, but me, they have despised,<br/>Yet envied; against me is all their rage,<br/>Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme<br/>Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,<br/>Hath honoured me, according to his will.<br/>Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;<br/>That they may have their wish, to try with me<br/>In battle which the stronger proves; they all,<br/>Or I alone against them; since by strength<br/>They measure all, of other excellence<br/>Not emulous, nor care who them excels;<br/>Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.<br/>So spake the Son, and into terrour changed<br/>His countenance too severe to be beheld,<br/>And full of wrath bent on his enemies.<br/>At once the Four spread out their starry wings<br/>With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs<br/>Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound<br/>Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.<br/>He on his impious foes right onward drove,<br/>Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels<br/>The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,<br/>All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon<br/>Among them he arrived; in his right hand<br/>Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent<br/>Before him, such as in their souls infixed<br/>Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,<br/>All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:<br/>O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode<br/>Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,<br/>That wished the mountains now might be again<br/>Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.<br/>Nor less on either side tempestuous fell<br/>His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four<br/>Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels<br/>Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;<br/>One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye<br/>Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire<br/>Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,<br/>And of their wonted vigour left them drained,<br/>Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.<br/>Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked<br/>His thunder in mid volley; for he meant<br/>Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:<br/>The overthrown he raised, and as a herd<br/>Of goats or timorous flock together thronged<br/>Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued<br/>With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds<br/>And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,<br/>Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed<br/>Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight<br/>Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse<br/>Urged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw<br/>Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath<br/>Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.<br/>Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw<br/>Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled<br/>Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep<br/>Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.<br/>Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared,<br/>And felt tenfold confusion in their fall<br/>Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout<br/>Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last<br/>Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;<br/>Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire<br/>Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.<br/>Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired<br/>Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.<br/>Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,<br/>Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:<br/>To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood<br/>Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,<br/>With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,<br/>Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,<br/>Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,<br/>Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,<br/>Worthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode<br/>Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts<br/>And temple of his Mighty Father throned<br/>On high; who into glory him received,<br/>Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.<br/>Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,<br/>At thy request, and that thou mayest beware<br/>By what is past, to thee I have revealed<br/>What might have else to human race been hid;<br/>The discord which befel, and war in Heaven<br/>Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall<br/>Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled<br/>With Satan; he who envies now thy state,<br/>Who now is plotting how he may seduce<br/>Thee also from obedience, that, with him<br/>Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake<br/>His punishment, eternal misery;<br/>Which would be all his solace and revenge,<br/>As a despite done against the Most High,<br/>Thee once to gain companion of his woe.<br/>But listen not to his temptations, warn<br/>Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,<br/>By terrible example, the reward<br/>Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,<br/>Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
