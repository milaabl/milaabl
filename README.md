<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Two Spirits: An Allegory by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    FIRST SPIRIT:<br/>O thou, who plumed with strong desire<br/>Wouldst float above the earth, beware!<br/>A Shadow tracks thy flight of fire--<br/>Night is coming!<br/>Bright are the regions of the air,<br/>And among the winds and beams<br/>It were delight to wander there--<br/>Night is coming!<br/><br/>SECOND SPIRIT:<br/>The deathless stars are bright above;<br/>If I would cross the shade of night,<br/>Within my heart is the lamp of love,<br/>And that is day!<br/>And the moon will smile with gentle light<br/>On my golden plumes where'er they move;<br/>The meteors will linger round my flight,<br/>And make night day.<br/><br/>FIRST SPIRIT:<br/>But if the whirlwinds of darkness waken<br/>Hail, and lightning, and stormy rain;<br/>See, the bounds of the air are shaken--<br/>Night is coming!<br/>The red swift clouds of the hurricane<br/>Yon declining sun have overtaken,<br/>The clash of the hail sweeps over the plain--<br/>Night is coming!<br/><br/>SECOND SPIRIT:<br/>I see the light, and I hear the sound;<br/>I'll sail on the flood of the tempest dark<br/>With the calm within and the light around<br/>Which makes night day:<br/>And thou, when the gloom is deep and stark,<br/>Look from thy dull earth, slumber-bound,<br/>My moon-like flight thou then mayst mark<br/>On high, far away.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Some say there is a precipice<br/>Where one vast pine is frozen to ruin<br/>O'er piles of snow and chasms of ice<br/>Mid Alpine mountains;<br/>And that the languid storm pursuing<br/>That winged shape, for ever flies<br/>Round those hoar branches, aye renewing<br/>Its aery fountains.<br/><br/>Some say when nights are dry and clear,<br/>And the death-dews sleep on the morass,<br/>Sweet whispers are heard by the traveller,<br/>Which make night day:<br/>And a silver shape like his early love doth pass<br/>Upborne by her wild and glittering hair,<br/>And when he awakes on the fragrant grass,<br/>He finds night day.
</p>
