# üíÆ M'Fingal - Canto III by *John Trumbull*

<p>
    Now warm with ministerial ire,<br/>Fierce sallied forth our loyal 'Squire,<br/>And on his striding steps attends<br/>His desperate clan of Tory friends.<br/>When sudden met his wrathful eye<br/>A pole ascending through the sky,<br/>Which numerous throngs of whiggish race<br/>Were raising in the market-place.<br/>Not higher school-boy's kites aspire,<br/>Or royal mast, or country spire;<br/>Like spears at Brobdignagian tilting,<br/>Or Satan's walking-staff in Milton.<br/>And on its top, the flag unfurl'd<br/>Waved triumph o'er the gazing world,<br/>Inscribed with inconsistent types<br/>Of Liberty and thirteen stripes.<br/>Beneath, the crowd without delay<br/>The dedication-rites essay,<br/>And gladly pay, in antient fashion,<br/>The ceremonies of libation;<br/>While briskly to each patriot lip<br/>Walks eager round the inspiring flip:<br/>Delicious draught! whose powers inherit<br/>The quintessence of public spirit;<br/>Which whoso tastes, perceives his mind<br/>To nobler politics refined;<br/>Or roused to martial controversy,<br/>As from transforming cups of Circe;<br/>Or warm'd with Homer's nectar'd liquor,<br/>That fill'd the veins of gods with ichor.<br/>At hand for new supplies in store,<br/>The tavern opes its friendly door,<br/>Whence to and fro the waiters run,<br/>Like bucket-men at fires in town.<br/>Then with three shouts that tore the sky,<br/>'Tis consecrate to Liberty.<br/>To guard it from th' attacks of Tories,<br/>A grand Committee cull'd of four is;<br/>Who foremost on the patriot spot,<br/>Had brought the flip, and paid the shot.<br/><br/><br/>By this, M'Fingal with his train<br/>Advanced upon th' adjacent plain,<br/>And full with loyalty possest,<br/>Pour'd forth the zeal, that fired his breast.<br/><br/><br/>"What mad-brain'd rebel gave commission,<br/>To raise this May-pole of sedition?<br/>Like Babel, rear'd by bawling throngs,<br/>With like confusion too of tongues,<br/>To point at heaven and summon down<br/>The thunders of the British crown?<br/>Say, will this paltry Pole secure<br/>Your forfeit heads from Gage's power?<br/>Attack'd by heroes brave and crafty,<br/>Is this to stand your ark of safety;<br/>Or driven by Scottish laird and laddie,<br/>Think ye to rest beneath its shadow?<br/>When bombs, like fiery serpents, fly,<br/>And balls rush hissing through the sky,<br/>Will this vile Pole, devote to freedom,<br/>Save like the Jewish pole in Edom;<br/>Or like the brazen snake of Moses,<br/>Cure your crackt skulls and batter'd noses?<br/><br/><br/>"Ye dupes to every factious rogue<br/>And tavern-prating demagogue,<br/>Whose tongue but rings, with sound more full,<br/>On th' empty drumhead of his scull;<br/>Behold you not what noisy fools<br/>Use you, worse simpletons, for tools?<br/>For Liberty, in your own by-sense,<br/>Is but for crimes a patent license,<br/>To break of law th' Egyptian yoke,<br/>And throw the world in common stock;<br/>Reduce all grievances and ills<br/>To Magna Charta of your wills;<br/>Establish cheats and frauds and nonsense,<br/>Framed to the model of your conscience;<br/>Cry justice down, as out of fashion,<br/>And fix its scale of depreciation;<br/>Defy all creditors to trouble ye,<br/>And keep new years of Jewish jubilee;<br/>Drive judges out, like Aaron's calves,<br/>By jurisdiction of white staves,<br/>And make the bar and bench and steeple<br/>Submit t' our Sovereign Lord, The People;<br/>By plunder rise to power and glory,<br/>And brand all property, as Tory;<br/>Expose all wares to lawful seizures<br/>By mobbers or monopolizers;<br/>Break heads and windows and the peace,<br/>For your own interest and increase;<br/>Dispute and pray and fight and groan<br/>For public good, and mean your own;<br/>Prevent the law by fierce attacks<br/>From quitting scores upon your backs;<br/>Lay your old dread, the gallows, low,<br/>And seize the stocks, your ancient foe,<br/>And turn them to convenient engines<br/>To wreak your patriotic vengeance;<br/>While all, your rights who understand,<br/>Confess them in their owner's hand;<br/>And when by clamours and confusions,<br/>Your freedom's grown a public nuisance,<br/>Cry "Liberty," with powerful yearning,<br/>As he does "Fire!" whose house is burning;<br/>Though he already has much more<br/>Than he can find occasion for.<br/>While every clown, that tills the plains,<br/>Though bankrupt in estate and brains,<br/>By this new light transform'd to traitor,<br/>Forsakes his plough to turn dictator,<br/>Starts an haranguing chief of Whigs,<br/>And drags you by the ears, like pigs.<br/>All bluster, arm'd with factious licence,<br/>New-born at once to politicians.<br/>Each leather-apron'd dunce, grown wise,<br/>Presents his forward face t' advise,<br/>And tatter'd legislators meet,<br/>From every workshop through the street.<br/>His goose the tailor finds new use in,<br/>To patch and turn the Constitution;<br/>The blacksmith comes with sledge and grate<br/>To iron-bind the wheels of state;<br/>The quack forbears his patients' souse,<br/>To purge the Council and the House;<br/>The tinker quits his moulds and doxies,<br/>To cast assembly-men and proxies.<br/>From dunghills deep of blackest hue,<br/>Your dirt-bred patriots spring to view,<br/>To wealth and power and honors rise,<br/>Like new-wing'd maggots changed to flies,<br/>And fluttering round in high parade,<br/>Strut in the robe, or gay cockade.<br/>See Arnold quits, for ways more certain,<br/>His bankrupt-perj'ries for his fortune,<br/>Brews rum no longer in his store,<br/>Jockey and skipper now no more,<br/>Forsakes his warehouses and docks,<br/>And writs of slander for the pox;<br/>And cleansed by patriotism from shame,<br/>Grows General of the foremost name.<br/>For in this ferment of the stream<br/>The dregs have work'd up to the brim,<br/>And by the rule of topsy-turvies,<br/>The scum stands foaming on the surface.<br/>You've caused your pyramid t' ascend,<br/>And set it on the little end.<br/>Like Hudibras, your empire's made,<br/>Whose crupper had o'ertopp'd his head.<br/>You've push'd and turn'd the whole world up-<br/>Side down, and got yourselves at top,<br/>While all the great ones of your state<br/>Are crush'd beneath the popular weight;<br/>Nor can you boast, this present hour,<br/>The shadow of the form of power.<br/>For what's your Congress or its end?<br/>A power, t' advise and recommend;<br/>To call forth troops, adjust your quotas--<br/>And yet no soul is bound to notice;<br/>To pawn your faith to th' utmost limit,<br/>But cannot bind you to redeem it;<br/>And when in want no more in them lies,<br/>Than begging from your State-Assemblies;<br/>Can utter oracles of dread,<br/>Like friar Bacon's brazen head,<br/>But when a faction dares dispute 'em,<br/>Has ne'er an arm to execute 'em:<br/>As tho' you chose supreme dictators,<br/>And put them under conservators.<br/>You've but pursued the self-same way<br/>With Shakespeare's Trinc'lo in the play;<br/>"You shall be Viceroys here, 'tis true,<br/>"But we'll be Viceroys over you."<br/>What wild confusion hence must ensue?<br/>Tho' common danger yet cements you:<br/>So some wreck'd vessel, all in shatters,<br/>Is held up by surrounding waters,<br/>But stranded, when the pressure ceases,<br/>Falls by its rottenness to pieces.<br/>And fall it must! if wars were ended,<br/>You'll ne'er have sense enough to mend it:<br/>But creeping on, by low intrigues,<br/>Like vermin of a thousand legs,<br/>'Twill find as short a life assign'd,<br/>As all things else of reptile kind.<br/>Your Commonwealth's a common harlot,<br/>The property of every varlet;<br/>Which now in taste, and full employ,<br/>All sorts admire, as all enjoy:<br/>But soon a batter'd strumpet grown,<br/>You'll curse and drum her out of town.<br/>Such is the government you chose;<br/>For this you bade the world be foes;<br/>For this, so mark'd for dissolution,<br/>You scorn the British Constitution,<br/>That constitution form'd by sages,<br/>The wonder of all modern ages;<br/>Which owns no failure in reality,<br/>Except corruption and venality;<br/>And merely proves the adage just,<br/>That best things spoil'd corrupt to worst:<br/>So man supreme in earthly station,<br/>And mighty lord of this creation,<br/>When once his corse is dead as herring,<br/>Becomes the most offensive carrion,<br/>And sooner breeds the plague, 'tis found,<br/>Than all beasts rotting on the ground.<br/>Yet with republics to dismay us,<br/>You've call'd up Anarchy from chaos,<br/>With all the followers of her school,<br/>Uproar and Rage and wild Misrule:<br/>For whom this rout of Whigs distracted,<br/>And ravings dire of every crack'd head;<br/>These new-cast legislative engines<br/>Of County-meetings and Conventions;<br/>Committees vile of correspondence,<br/>And mobs, whose tricks have almost undone 's:<br/>While reason fails to check your course,<br/>And Loyalty's kick'd out of doors,<br/>And Folly, like inviting landlord,<br/>Hoists on your poles her royal standard;<br/>While the king's friends, in doleful dumps,<br/>Have worn their courage to the stumps,<br/>And leaving George in sad disaster,<br/>Most sinfully deny their master.<br/>What furies raged when you, in sea,<br/>In shape of Indians, drown'd the tea;<br/>When your gay sparks, fatigued to watch it,<br/>Assumed the moggison and hatchet,<br/>With wampum'd blankets hid their laces,<br/>And like their sweethearts, primed their faces:<br/>While not a red-coat dared oppose,<br/>And scarce a Tory show'd his nose;<br/>While Hutchinson, for sure retreat,<br/>Manoeuvred to his country seat,<br/>And thence affrighted, in the suds,<br/>Stole off bareheaded through the woods.<br/><br/><br/>"Have you not roused your mobs to join,<br/>And make Mandamus-men resign,<br/>Call'd forth each dufill-drest curmudgeon,<br/>With dirty trowsers and white bludgeon,<br/>Forced all our Councils through the land,<br/>To yield their necks at your command;<br/>While paleness marks their late disgraces,<br/>Through all their rueful length of faces?<br/><br/><br/>"Have you not caused as woeful work<br/>In our good city of New-York,<br/>When all the rabble, well cockaded,<br/>In triumph through the streets paraded,<br/>And mobb'd the Tories, scared their spouses,<br/>And ransack'd all the custom-houses;<br/>Made such a tumult, bluster, jarring,<br/>That mid the clash of tempests warring,<br/>Smith's weather-cock, in veers forlorn,<br/>Could hardly tell which way to turn?<br/>Burn'd effigies of higher powers,<br/>Contrived in planetary hours;<br/>As witches with clay-images<br/>Destroy or torture whom they please:<br/>Till fired with rage, th' ungrateful club<br/>Spared not your best friend, Beelzebub,<br/>O'erlook'd his favors, and forgot<br/>The reverence due his cloven foot,<br/>And in the selfsame furnace frying,<br/>Stew'd him, and North and Bute and Tryon?<br/>Did you not, in as vile and shallow way,<br/>Fright our poor Philadelphian, Galloway,<br/>Your Congress, when the loyal ribald<br/>Belied, berated and bescribbled?<br/>What ropes and halters did you send,<br/>Terrific emblems of his end,<br/>Till, least he'd hang in more than effigy,<br/>Fled in a fog the trembling refugee?<br/>Now rising in progression fatal,<br/>Have you not ventured to give battle?<br/>When Treason chaced our heroes troubled,<br/>With rusty gun, and leathern doublet;<br/>Turn'd all stone-walls and groves and bushes,<br/>To batteries arm'd with blunderbusses;<br/>And with deep wounds, that fate portend,<br/>Gaul'd many a Briton's latter end;<br/>Drove them to Boston, as in jail,<br/>Confined without mainprize or bail.<br/>Were not these deeds enough betimes,<br/>To heap the measure of your crimes:<br/>But in this loyal town and dwelling,<br/>You raise these ensigns of rebellion?<br/>'Tis done! fair Mercy shuts her door;<br/>And Vengeance now shall sleep no more.<br/>Rise then, my friends, in terror rise,<br/>And sweep this scandal from the skies.<br/>You'll see their Dagon, though well jointed,<br/>Will shrink before the Lord's anointed;<br/>And like old Jericho's proud wall,<br/>Before our ram's horns prostrate fall."<br/><br/><br/>This said, our 'Squire, yet undismay'd,<br/>Call'd forth the Constable to aid,<br/>And bade him read, in nearer station,<br/>The Riot-act and Proclamation.<br/>He swift, advancing to the ring,<br/>Began, "Our Sovereign Lord, the King"--<br/>When thousand clam'rous tongues he hears,<br/>And clubs and stones assail his ears.<br/>To fly was vain; to fight was idle;<br/>By foes encompass'd in the middle,<br/>His hope, in stratagems, he found,<br/>And fell right craftily to ground;<br/>Then crept to seek an hiding place,<br/>'Twas all he could, beneath a brace;<br/>Where soon the conq'ring crew espied him,<br/>And where he lurk'd, they caught and tied him.<br/><br/><br/>At once with resolution fatal,<br/>Both Whigs and Tories rush'd to battle.<br/>Instead of weapons, either band<br/>Seized on such arms as came to hand.<br/>And as famed Ovid paints th' adventures<br/>Of wrangling Lapith√¶ and Centaurs,<br/>Who at their feast, by Bacchus led,<br/>Threw bottles at each other's head;<br/>And these arms failing in their scuffles,<br/>Attack'd with andirons, tongs and shovels:<br/>So clubs and billets, staves and stones<br/>Met fierce, encountering every sconce,<br/>And cover'd o'er with knobs and pains<br/>Each void receptacle for brains;<br/>Their clamours rend the skies around,<br/>The hills rebellow to the sound;<br/>And many a groan increas'd the din<br/>From batter'd nose and broken shin.<br/>M'Fingal, rising at the word,<br/>Drew forth his old militia-sword;<br/>Thrice cried "King George," as erst in distress,<br/>Knights of romance invoked a mistress;<br/>And brandishing the blade in air,<br/>Struck terror through th' opposing war.<br/>The Whigs, unsafe within the wind<br/>Of such commotion, shrunk behind.<br/>With whirling steel around address'd,<br/>Fierce through their thickest throng he press'd,<br/>(Who roll'd on either side in arch,<br/>Like Red Sea waves in Israel's march)<br/>And like a meteor rushing through,<br/>Struck on their Pole a vengeful blow.<br/>Around, the Whigs, of clubs and stones<br/>Discharged whole vollies, in platoons,<br/>That o'er in whistling fury fly;<br/>But not a foe dares venture nigh.<br/>And now perhaps with glory crown'd<br/>Our 'Squire had fell'd the pole to ground,<br/>Had not some Pow'r, a whig at heart,<br/>Descended down and took their part;<br/>(Whether 'twere Pallas, Mars or Iris,<br/>'Tis scarce worth while to make inquiries)<br/>Who at the nick of time alarming,<br/>Assumed the solemn form of Chairman,<br/>Address'd a Whig, in every scene<br/>The stoutest wrestler on the green,<br/>And pointed where the spade was found,<br/>Late used to set their pole in ground,<br/>And urged, with equal arms and might,<br/>To dare our 'Squire to single fight.<br/>The Whig thus arm'd, untaught to yield,<br/>Advanced tremendous to the field:<br/>Nor did M'Fingal shun the foe,<br/>But stood to brave the desp'rate blow;<br/>While all the party gazed, suspended<br/>To see the deadly combat ended;<br/>And Jove in equal balance weigh'd<br/>The sword against the brandish'd spade,<br/>He weigh'd; but lighter than a dream,<br/>The sword flew up, and kick'd the beam.<br/>Our 'Squire on tiptoe rising fair<br/>Lifts high a noble stroke in air,<br/>Which hung not, but like dreadful engines,<br/>Descended on his foe in vengeance.<br/>But ah! in danger, with dishonor<br/>The sword perfidious fails its owner;<br/>That sword, which oft had stood its ground,<br/>By huge trainbands encircled round;<br/>And on the bench, with blade right loyal,<br/>Had won the day at many a trial,<br/>Of stones and clubs had braved th' alarms,<br/>Shrunk from these new Vulcanian arms.<br/>The spade so temper'd from the sledge,<br/>Nor keen nor solid harm'd its edge,<br/>Now met it, from his arm of might,<br/>Descending with steep force to smite;<br/>The blade snapp'd short--and from his hand,<br/>With rust embrown'd the glittering sand.<br/>Swift turn'd M'Fingal at the view,<br/>And call'd to aid th' attendant crew,<br/>In vain; the Tories all had run,<br/>When scarce the fight was well begun;<br/>Their setting wigs he saw decreas'd<br/>Far in th' horizon tow'rd the west.<br/>Amazed he view'd the shameful sight,<br/>And saw no refuge, but in flight:<br/>But age unwieldy check'd his pace,<br/>Though fear had wing'd his flying race;<br/>For not a trifling prize at stake;<br/>No less than great M'Fingal's back.<br/>With legs and arms he work'd his course,<br/>Like rider that outgoes his horse,<br/>And labor'd hard to get away, as<br/>Old Satan struggling on through chaos;<br/>Till looking back, he spied in rear<br/>The spade-arm'd chief advanced too near:<br/>Then stopp'd and seized a stone, that lay<br/>An ancient landmark near the way;<br/>Nor shall we as old bards have done,<br/>Affirm it weigh'd an hundred ton;<br/>But such a stone, as at a shift<br/>A modern might suffice to lift,<br/>Since men, to credit their enigmas,<br/>Are dwindled down to dwarfs and pigmies,<br/>And giants exiled with their cronies<br/>To Brobdignags and Patagonias.<br/>But while our Hero turn'd him round,<br/>And tugg'd to raise it from the ground,<br/>The fatal spade discharged a blow<br/>Tremendous on his rear below:<br/>His bent knee fail'd, and void of strength<br/>Stretch'd on the ground his manly length.<br/>Like ancient oak o'erturn'd, he lay,<br/>Or tower to tempests fall'n a prey,<br/>Or mountain sunk with all his pines,<br/>Or flow'r the plow to dust consigns,<br/>And more things else--but all men know 'em,<br/>If slightly versed in epic poem.<br/>At once the crew, at this dread crisis,<br/>Fall on, and bind him, ere he rises;<br/>And with loud shouts and joyful soul,<br/>Conduct him prisoner to the pole.<br/>When now the mob in lucky hour<br/>Had got their en'mies in their power,<br/>They first proceed, by grave command,<br/>To take the Constable in hand.<br/>Then from the pole's sublimest top<br/>The active crew let down the rope,<br/>At once its other end in haste bind,<br/>And make it fast upon his waistband;<br/>Till like the earth, as stretch'd on tenter,<br/>He hung self-balanced on his centre.<br/>Then upwards, all hands hoisting sail,<br/>They swung him, like a keg of ale,<br/>Till to the pinnacle in height<br/>He vaulted, like balloon or kite.<br/>As Socrates of old at first did<br/>To aid philosophy get hoisted,<br/>And found his thoughts flow strangely clear,<br/>Swung in a basket in mid air:<br/>Our culprit thus, in purer sky,<br/>With like advantage raised his eye,<br/>And looking forth in prospect wide,<br/>His Tory errors clearly spied,<br/>And from his elevated station,<br/>With bawling voice began addressing.<br/><br/><br/>"Good Gentlemen and friends and kin,<br/>For heaven's sake hear, if not for mine!<br/>I here renounce the Pope, the Turks,<br/>The King, the Devil and all their works;<br/>And will, set me but once at ease,<br/>Turn Whig or Christian, what you please;<br/>And always mind your rules so justly,<br/>Should I live long as old Methus'lah,<br/>I'll never join in British rage,<br/>Nor help Lord North, nor Gen'ral Gage;<br/>Nor lift my gun in future fights,<br/>Nor take away your Charter-rights;<br/>Nor overcome your new-raised levies,<br/>Destroy your towns, nor burn your navies;<br/>Nor cut your poles down while I've breath,<br/>Though raised more thick than hatchel-teeth:<br/>But leave King George and all his elves<br/>To do their conq'ring work themselves."<br/><br/><br/>This said, they lower'd him down in state,<br/>Spread at all points, like falling cat;<br/>But took a vote first on the question,<br/>That they'd accept this full confession,<br/>And to their fellowship and favor,<br/>Restore him on his good behaviour.<br/><br/><br/>Not so our 'Squire submits to rule,<br/>But stood, heroic as a mule.<br/>"You'll find it all in vain, quoth he,<br/>To play your rebel tricks on me.<br/>All punishments, the world can render,<br/>Serve only to provoke th' offender;<br/>The will gains strength from treatment horrid,<br/>As hides grow harder when they're curried.<br/>No man e'er felt the halter draw,<br/>With good opinion of the law;<br/>Or held in method orthodox<br/>His love of justice, in the stocks;<br/>Or fail'd to lose by sheriff's shears<br/>At once his loyalty and ears.<br/>Have you made Murray look less big,<br/>Or smoked old Williams to a Whig?<br/>Did our mobb'd Ol'ver quit his station,<br/>Or heed his vows of resignation?<br/>Has Rivington, in dread of stripes,<br/>Ceased lying since you stole his types?<br/>And can you think my faith will alter,<br/>By tarring, whipping or the halter?<br/>I'll stand the worst; for recompense<br/>I trust King George and Providence.<br/>And when with conquest gain'd I come,<br/>Array'd in law and terror home,<br/>Ye'll rue this inauspicious morn,<br/>And curse the day, when ye were born,<br/>In Job's high style of imprecations,<br/>With all his plagues, without his patience."<br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile beside the pole, the guard<br/>A Bench of Justice had prepared,<br/>Where sitting round in awful sort<br/>The grand Committee hold their Court;<br/>While all the crew, in silent awe,<br/>Wait from their lips the lore of law.<br/>Few moments with deliberation<br/>They hold the solemn consultation;<br/>When soon in judgment all agree,<br/>And Clerk proclaims the dread decree;<br/>"That 'Squire M'Fingal having grown<br/>The vilest Tory in the town,<br/>And now in full examination<br/>Convicted by his own confession,<br/>Finding no tokens of repentance,<br/>This Court proceeds to render sentence:<br/>That first the Mob a slip-knot single<br/>Tie round the neck of said M'Fingal,<br/>And in due form do tar him next,<br/>And feather, as the law directs;<br/>Then through the town attendant ride him<br/>In cart with Constable beside him,<br/>And having held him up to shame,<br/>Bring to the pole, from whence he came."<br/><br/><br/>Forthwith the crowd proceed to deck<br/>With halter'd noose M'Fingal's neck,<br/>While he in peril of his soul<br/>Stood tied half-hanging to the pole;<br/>Then lifting high the ponderous jar,<br/>Pour'd o'er his head the smoaking tar.<br/>With less profusion once was spread<br/>Oil on the Jewish monarch's head,<br/>That down his beard and vestments ran,<br/>And cover'd all his outward man.<br/>As when (so Claudian sings) the Gods<br/>And earth-born Giants fell at odds,<br/>The stout Enceladus in malice<br/>Tore mountains up to throw at Pallas;<br/>And while he held them o'er his head,<br/>The river, from their fountains fed,<br/>Pour'd down his back its copious tide,<br/>And wore its channels in his hide:<br/>So from the high-raised urn the torrents<br/>Spread down his side their various currents;<br/>His flowing wig, as next the brim,<br/>First met and drank the sable stream;<br/>Adown his visage stern and grave<br/>Roll'd and adhered the viscid wave;<br/>With arms depending as he stood,<br/>Each cuff capacious holds the flood;<br/>From nose and chin's remotest end,<br/>The tarry icicles descend;<br/>Till all o'erspread, with colors gay,<br/>He glitter'd to the western ray,<br/>Like sleet-bound trees in wintry skies,<br/>Or Lapland idol carved in ice.<br/>And now the feather-bag display'd<br/>Is waved in triumph o'er his head,<br/>And clouds him o'er with feathers missive,<br/>And down, upon the tar, adhesive:<br/>Not Maia's son, with wings for ears,<br/>Such plumage round his visage wears;<br/>Nor Milton's six-wing'd angel gathers<br/>Such superfluity of feathers.<br/>Now all complete appears our 'Squire,<br/>Like Gorgon or Chim√¶ra dire;<br/>Nor more could boast on Plato's plan<br/>To rank among the race of man,<br/>Or prove his claim to human nature,<br/>As a two-legg'd, unfeather'd creature.<br/><br/><br/>Then on the fatal cart, in state<br/>They raised our grand Duumvirate.<br/>And as at Rome a like committee,<br/>Who found an owl within their city,<br/>With solemn rites and grave processions<br/>At every shrine perform'd lustrations;<br/>And least infection might take place<br/>From such grim fowl with feather'd face,<br/>All Rome attends him through the street<br/>In triumph to his country seat:<br/>With like devotion all the choir<br/>Paraded round our awful 'Squire;<br/>In front the martial music comes<br/>Of horns and fiddles, fifes and drums,<br/>With jingling sound of carriage bells,<br/>And treble creak of rusted wheels.<br/>Behind, the croud, in lengthen'd row<br/>With proud procession, closed the show.<br/>And at fit periods every throat<br/>Combined in universal shout;<br/>And hail'd great Liberty in chorus,<br/>Or bawl'd 'confusion to the Tories.'<br/>Not louder storm the welkin braves<br/>From clamors of conflicting waves;<br/>Less dire in Lybian wilds the noise<br/>When rav'ning lions lift their voice;<br/>Or triumphs at town-meetings made,<br/>On passing votes to regulate trade.<br/><br/><br/>Thus having borne them round the town,<br/>Last at the pole they set them down;<br/>And to the tavern take their way<br/>To end in mirth the festal day.<br/><br/><br/>And now the Mob, dispersed and gone,<br/>Left 'Squire and Constable alone.<br/>The constable with rueful face<br/>Lean'd sad and solemn o'er a brace;<br/>And fast beside him, cheek by jowl,<br/>Stuck 'Squire M'Fingal 'gainst the pole,<br/>Glued by the tar t' his rear applied,<br/>Like barnacle on vessel's side.<br/>But though his body lack'd physician,<br/>His spirit was in worse condition.<br/>He found his fears of whips and ropes<br/>By many a drachm outweigh'd his hopes.<br/>As men in jail without mainprize<br/>View every thing with other eyes,<br/>And all goes wrong in church and state,<br/>Seen through perspective of the grate:<br/>So now M'Fingal's Second-sight<br/>Beheld all things in gloomier light;<br/>His visual nerve, well purged with tar,<br/>Saw all the coming scenes of war.<br/>As his prophetic soul grew stronger,<br/>He found he could hold in no longer.<br/>First from the pole, as fierce he shook,<br/>His wig from pitchy durance broke,<br/>His mouth unglued, his feathers flutter'd,<br/>His tarr'd skirts crack'd, and thus he utter'd.<br/><br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Constable, in vain<br/>We strive 'gainst wind and tide and rain!<br/>Behold my doom! this feathery omen<br/>Portends what dismal times are coming.<br/>Now future scenes, before my eyes,<br/>And second-sighted forms arise.<br/>I hear a voice, that calls away,<br/>And cries 'The Whigs will win the day.'<br/>My beck'ning Genius gives command,<br/>And bids me fly the fatal land;<br/>Where changing name and constitution,<br/>Rebellion turns to Revolution,<br/>While Loyalty, oppress'd, in tears,<br/>Stands trembling for its neck and ears.<br/><br/><br/>"Go, summon all our brethren, greeting,<br/>To muster at our usual meeting;<br/>There my prophetic voice shall warn 'em<br/>Of all things future that concern 'em,<br/>And scenes disclose on which, my friend,<br/>Their conduct and their lives depend.<br/>There I--but first 'tis more of use,<br/>From this vile pole to set me loose;<br/>Then go with cautious steps and steady,<br/>While I steer home and make all ready.
