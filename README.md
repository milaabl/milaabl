# üíÆ Condolatory Address to Sarah Countess of Jersey, on the Prince Regent's Returning Her Picture to Mrs. Mee by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    WHEN the vain triumph of the imperial lord,<br/>Whom servile Rome obeyed, and yet abhorred,<br/>Gave to the vulgar gaze each glorious bust,<br/>That left a likeness of the brave, or just;<br/>What most admired each scrutinising eye<br/>Of all that decked that passing pageantry?<br/>What spread from face to face that wondering air?<br/>The thought of Brutus--for his was not there!<br/>That absence proved his worth,--that absence fixed<br/>His memory on the longing mind, unmixed;<br/>And more decreed his glory to endure,<br/>Than all a gold Colossus could secure.<br/><br/>If thus, fair Jersey, our desiring gaze<br/>Search for thy form, in vain and mute amaze,<br/>Amidst those pictured charms, whose loveliness,<br/>Bright though they be, thine own had rendered less:<br/>If he, that VAIN OLD MAN, whom truth admits<br/>Heir of his father's crown, and of his wits,<br/>If his corrupted eye, and withered heart,<br/>Could with thy gentle image bear to part;<br/>That tasteless shame be _his_, and ours the grief,<br/>To gaze on Beauty's band without its chief:<br/>Yet Comfort still one selfish thought imparts,<br/>We lose the portrait, but preserve our hearts.<br/><br/>What can his vaulted gallery now disclose?<br/>A _garden_ with all flowers--except the rose;--<br/>A _fount_ that only wants its living stream;<br/>A _night_, with every star, save Dian's beam.<br/>Lost to our eyes the present forms shall be,<br/>That turn from tracing them to dream of thee;<br/>And more on that recalled resemblance pause,<br/>Than all he _shall_ not force on our applause.<br/><br/>Long may thy yet meridian lustre shine,<br/>With all that Virtue asks of Homage thine:<br/>The symmetry of youth--the grace of mien--<br/>The eye that gladdens--and the brow serene;<br/>The glossy darkness of that clustering hair,<br/>Which shades, yet shows that forehead more than fair!<br/>Each glance that wins us, and the life that throws<br/>A spell which will not let our looks repose,<br/>But turn to gaze again, and find anew<br/>Some charm that well rewards another view.<br/>These are not lessened, these are still as bright,<br/>Albeit too dazzling _for a dotard's sight_;<br/>And those must wait till ev'ry charm is gone,<br/>To please the paltry heart that pleases none;--<br/>That dull cold sensualist, whose sickly eye<br/>In envious dimness passed thy portrait by;<br/>Who racked his little spirit to combine<br/>Its hate of _Freedom's_ loveliness, and _thine_.
</p>
