# üíÆ M'Fingal - Canto IV by *John Trumbull*

<p>
    Now Night came down, and rose full soon<br/>That patroness of rogues, the Moon;<br/>Beneath whose kind protecting ray,<br/>Wolves, brute and human, prowl for prey.<br/>The honest world all snored in chorus,<br/>While owls and ghosts and thieves and Tories,<br/>Whom erst the mid-day sun had awed,<br/>Crept from their lurking holes abroad.<br/><br/><br/>On cautious hinges, slow and stiller,<br/>Wide oped the great M'Fingal's cellar,<br/>Where safe from prying eyes, in cluster,<br/>The Tory Pandemonium muster.<br/>Their chiefs all sitting round descried are,<br/>On kegs of ale and seats of cider;<br/>When first M'Fingal, dimly seen,<br/>Rose solemn from the turnip-bin.<br/>Nor yet his form had wholly lost<br/>Th' original brightness it could boast,<br/>Nor less appear'd than Justice Quorum,<br/>In feather'd majesty before 'em.<br/>Adown his tar-streak'd visage, clear<br/>Fell glistening fast th' indignant tear,<br/>And thus his voice, in mournful wise,<br/>Pursued the prologue of his sighs.<br/><br/><br/>"Brethren and friends, the glorious band<br/>Of loyalty in rebel land!<br/>It was not thus you've seen me sitting,<br/>Return'd in triumph from town-meeting;<br/>When blust'ring Whigs were put to stand,<br/>And votes obey'd my guiding hand,<br/>And new commissions pleased my eyes;<br/>Blest days, but ah, no more to rise!<br/>Alas, against my better light,<br/>And optics sure of second-sight,<br/>My stubborn soul, in error strong,<br/>Had faith in Hutchinson too long.<br/>See what brave trophies still we bring<br/>From all our battles for the king;<br/>And yet these plagues, now past before us,<br/>Are but our entering wedge of sorrows!<br/><br/><br/>"I see, in glooms tempestuous, stand<br/>The cloud impending o'er the land;<br/>That cloud, which still beyond their hopes<br/>Serves all our orators with tropes;<br/>Which, though from our own vapors fed,<br/>Shall point its thunders on our head!<br/>I see the Mob, beflipp'd at taverns,<br/>Hunt us, like wolves, through wilds and caverns!<br/>What dungeons open on our fears!<br/>What horsewhips whistle round our ears!<br/>Tar, yet in embryo in the pine,<br/>Shall run on Tories' backs to shine;<br/>Trees, rooted fair in groves of sallows,<br/>Are growing for our future gallows;<br/>And geese unhatch'd, when pluck'd in fray,<br/>Shall rue the feathering of that day.<br/><br/><br/>"For me, before that fatal time,<br/>I mean to fly th' accursed clime,<br/>And follow omens, which of late<br/>Have warn'd me of impending fate.<br/><br/><br/>"For late in visions of the night<br/>The gallows stood before my sight;<br/>I saw its ladder heaved on end;<br/>I saw the deadly rope descend,<br/>And in its noose, that wavering swang,<br/>Friend Malcolm hung, or seem'd to hang.<br/>How changed from him, who bold as lion,<br/>Stood Aid-de-camp to Gen'ral Tryon,<br/>Made rebels vanish once, like witches,<br/>And saved his life, but dropp'd his breeches.<br/>I scarce had made a fearful bow,<br/>And trembling ask'd him, "How d'ye do;"<br/>When lifting up his eyes so wide,<br/>His eyes alone, his hands were tied;<br/>With feeble voice, as spirits use,<br/>Now almost choak'd by gripe of noose;<br/><br/><br/>"Ah, fly my friend, he cried, escape,<br/>And keep yourself from this sad scrape;<br/>Enough you've talk'd and writ and plann'd;<br/>The Whigs have got the upper hand.<br/>Could mortal arm our fears have ended,<br/>This arm (and shook it) had defended.<br/>Wait not till things grow desperater,<br/>For hanging is no laughing matter.<br/>Adventure then no longer stay;<br/>But call your friends and haste away.<br/><br/><br/>"For lo, through deepest glooms of night,<br/>I come to aid thy second-sight,<br/>Disclose the plagues that round us wait,<br/>And scan the dark decrees of fate.<br/><br/><br/>"Ascend this ladder, whence unfurl'd<br/>The curtain opes of t'other world;<br/>For here new worlds their scenes unfold,<br/>Seen from this backdoor of the old.<br/>As when √Üneas risk'd his life,<br/>Like Orpheus vent'ring for his wife,<br/>And bore in show his mortal carcase<br/>Through realms of Erebus and Orcus,<br/>Then in the happy fields Elysian,<br/>Saw all his embryon sons in vision;<br/>As shown by great Archangel, Michael,<br/>Old Adam saw the world's whole sequel,<br/>And from the mount's extended space,<br/>The rising fortunes of his race:<br/>So from this stage shalt thou behold<br/>The war its coming scenes unfold,<br/>Raised by my arm to meet thine eye;<br/>My Adam, thou; thine Angel, I.<br/><br/><br/>But first my pow'r, for visions bright,<br/>Must cleanse from clouds thy mental sight,<br/>Remove the dim suffusions spread,<br/>Which bribes and salaries there have bred;<br/>And from the well of Bute infuse<br/>Three genuine drops of Highland dews,<br/>To purge, like euphrasy and rue,<br/>Thine eyes, for much thou hast to view.<br/><br/><br/>Now freed from Tory darkness, raise<br/>Thy head and spy the coming days.<br/>For lo, before our second-sight,<br/>The Continent ascends in light.<br/>From north to south, what gath'ring swarms<br/>Increase the pride of rebel arms!<br/>Through every State our legions brave<br/>Speed gallant marches to the grave,<br/>Of battling Whigs the frequent prize,<br/>While rebel trophies stain the skies.<br/>Behold o'er northern realms afar<br/>Extend the kindling flames of war!<br/>See famed St. John's and Montreal<br/>Doom'd by Montgomery's arm to fall!<br/>Where Hudson with majestic sway<br/>Through hills disparted plows his way,<br/>Fate spreads on Bemus' heights alarms,<br/>And pours destruction on our arms;<br/>There Bennington's ensanguined plain,<br/>And Stony-Point, the prize of Wayne.<br/>Behold near Del'ware's icy roar,<br/>Where morning dawns on Trenton's shore,<br/>While Hessians spread their Christmas feasts,<br/>Rush rude these uninvited guests;<br/>Nor aught avails the captured crew<br/>Their martial whiskers' grisly hue!<br/>On Princeton plains our heroes yield,<br/>And spread in flight the vanquish'd field;<br/>While fear to Mawhood's heels puts on<br/>Wings, wide as worn by Maia's son.<br/>Behold the Pennsylvanian shore<br/>Enrich'd with streams of British gore;<br/>Where many a veteran chief in bed<br/>Of honor rests his slumb'ring head,<br/>And in soft vales, in land of foes,<br/>Their wearied virtue finds repose!<br/>See plund'ring Dunmore's negro band<br/>Fly headlong from Virginia's strand;<br/>And far on southern hills our cousins,<br/>The Scotch M'Donalds, fall by dozens;<br/>Or where King's Mountain lifts its head,<br/>Our ruin'd bands in triumph led!<br/>Behold, o'er Tarlton's blustring train<br/>Defeat extends the captive chain!<br/>Afar near Eutaw's fatal springs,<br/>Lo, rebel Vict'ry spreads her wings!<br/>Through all the land, in varied chace,<br/>We hunt the rainbow of success,<br/>In vain! their Chief, superior still,<br/>Eludes our force with Fabian skill;<br/>Or swift descending by surprize,<br/>Like Prussia's eagle, sweeps the prize.<br/><br/><br/>"I look'd; nor yet, oppress'd with fears,<br/>Gave credit to my eyes or ears;<br/>But held the sights an empty dream,<br/>On Berkley's immaterial scheme;<br/>And pond'ring sad with troubled breast,<br/>At length my rising doubts express'd.<br/>'Ah, whither thus, by rebels smitten,<br/>Is fled th' omnipotence of Britain;<br/>Or fail'd its usual guard to keep,<br/>Absent from home or fast asleep?<br/>Did not, retired to bowers Flysian,<br/>Great Mars leave with her his commission,<br/>And Neptune erst, in treaty free,<br/>Give up dominion o'er the sea?<br/>Else where's the faith of famed orations,<br/>Address, debate and proclamations,<br/>Or courtly sermon, laureat ode,<br/>And ballads on the wat'ry God;<br/>With whose high strains great George enriches<br/>His eloquence of gracious speeches?<br/>Not faithful to our Highland eyes,<br/>These deadly forms of vision rise.<br/>Some whig-inspiring rebel sprite<br/>Now palms delusion on our sight.<br/>I'd scarcely trust a tale so vain,<br/>Should revelation prompt the strain;<br/>Or Ossian's ghost the scenes rehearse<br/>In all the melody of Erse."<br/><br/><br/>"Too long," quoth Malcolm, "from confusion,<br/>You've dwelt already in delusion;<br/>As sceptics, of all fools the chief,<br/>Hold faith in creeds of unbelief.<br/>I come to draw thy veil aside<br/>Of error, prejudice and pride.<br/>Fools love deception, but the wise<br/>Prefer sad truths to pleasing lies.<br/>For know, those hopes can ne'er succeed,<br/>That trust on Britain's breaking reed.<br/>For weak'ning long from bad to worse,<br/>By cureless atrophy of purse,<br/>She feels at length with trembling heart,<br/>Her foes have found her mortal part.<br/>As famed Achilles, dipp'd by Thetis<br/>In Styx, as sung in antient ditties,<br/>Grew all case-harden'd o'er, like steel,<br/>Invulnerable, save his heel;<br/>And laugh'd at swords and spears and squibs,<br/>And all diseases, but the kibes;<br/>Yet met at last his deadly wound,<br/>By Paris' arrow nail'd to ground:<br/>So Britain's boasted strength deserts<br/>In these her empire's utmost skirts,<br/>Removed beyond her fierce impressions,<br/>And atmosphere of omnipresence;<br/>Nor to this shore's remoter ends<br/>Her dwarf-omnipotence extends.<br/>Hence in this turn of things so strange,<br/>'Tis time our principles to change:<br/>For vain that boasted faith, that gathers<br/>No perquisite, but tar and feathers;<br/>No pay, but stripes from whiggish malice,<br/>And no promotion, but the gallows.<br/>I've long enough stood firm and steady,<br/>Half-hang'd for loyalty already,<br/>And could I save my neck and pelf,<br/>I'd turn a flaming whig myself.<br/>But since, obnoxious here to fate,<br/>This saving wisdom comes too late,<br/>Our noblest hopes already crost,<br/>Our sal'ries gone, our titles lost,<br/>Doom'd to worse suff'rings from the mob,<br/>Than Satan's surg'ries used on Job;<br/>What hope remains, but now with sleight<br/>What's left of us to save by flight?<br/><br/><br/>'Now raise thine eyes, for visions true<br/>Again ascending wait thy view.'<br/><br/><br/>"I look'd; and clad in early light,<br/>The spires of Boston met my sight;<br/>The morn o'er eastern hills afar<br/>Illumed the varied scenes of war;<br/>Great Howe had sweetly in the lap<br/>Of Loring taken out his nap;<br/>When all th' encircling hills around<br/>With instantaneous breastworks crown'd,<br/>With pointed thunders met his sight,<br/>Like magic, rear'd the former night.<br/>Each summit, far as eye commands,<br/>Shone, peopled with rebellious bands.<br/>Aloft their tow'ring heroes rise,<br/>As Titans erst assail'd the skies;<br/>Leagued in superior force to prove<br/>The sceptred hand of British Jove.<br/>Mounds piled on hills ascended fair<br/>With batt'ries placed in middle air,<br/>That hurl'd their fiery bolts amain,<br/>In thunder on the trembling plain.<br/>I saw, along the prostrate strand<br/>Our baffled generals quit the land,<br/>Eager, as frighted mermaids, flee<br/>T' our boasted element, the sea,<br/>And tow'rd their town of refuge fly,<br/>Like convict Jews condemn'd to die.<br/>Then to the north I turn'd my eyes,<br/>Where Saratoga's heights arise,<br/>And saw our chosen vet'ran band<br/>Descend in terror o'er the land;<br/>T' oppose this fury of alarms,<br/>Saw all New-England wake to arms,<br/>And every Yankee, full of mettle,<br/>Swarm forth, like bees at sound of kettle.<br/>Not Rome, when Tarquin raped Lucretia,<br/>Saw wilder must'ring of militia.<br/>Through all the woods and plains of fight,<br/>What mortal battles pain'd my sight,<br/>While British corses strew'd the shore,<br/>And Hudson tinged his streams with gore.<br/>What tongue can tell the dismal day,<br/>Or paint the parti-color'd fray,<br/>When yeomen left their fields afar<br/>To plow the crimson plains of war;<br/>When zeal to swords transform'd their shares,<br/>And turn'd their pruning hooks to spears,<br/>Changed tailor's geese to guns and ball,<br/>And stretch'd to pikes the cobbler's awl;<br/>While hunters, fierce like mighty Nimrod,<br/>Made on our troops a furious inroad,<br/>And levelling squint on barrel round,<br/>Brought our beau-officers to ground;<br/>While sunburnt wigs, in high command,<br/>Rush daring on our frighted band,<br/>And ancient beards and hoary hair,<br/>Like meteors, stream in troubled air;<br/>While rifle-frocks drove Gen'rals cap'ring,<br/>And Red-coats shrunk from leathern apron,<br/>And epaulette and gorget run<br/>From whinyard brown and rusty gun.<br/>With locks unshorn not Samson more<br/>Made useless all the show of war,<br/>Nor fought with ass's jaw for rarity<br/>With more success, or singularity.<br/>I saw our vet'ran thousands yield,<br/>And pile their muskets on the field,<br/>And peasant guards, in rueful plight,<br/>March off our captured bands from fight;<br/>While every rebel fife in play<br/>To Yankee-doodle tuned its lay,<br/>And like the music of the spheres,<br/>Mellifluous sooth'd their vanquish'd ears."<br/><br/><br/>"Alas, I cried, what baleful star<br/>Sheds fatal influence on the war?<br/>And who that chosen Chief of fame,<br/>That heads this grand parade of shame?"<br/><br/><br/>"There see how fate, great Malcolm cried,<br/>Strikes with its bolts the tow'rs of pride!<br/>Behold that martial Macaroni,<br/>Compound of Phoebus and Bellona,<br/>Equipp'd alike for feast or fray,<br/>With warlike sword and singsong lay,<br/>Where equal wit and valour join!<br/>This, this is he--the famed Burgoyne!<br/>Who pawn'd his honor and commission,<br/>To coax the patriots to submission,<br/>By songs and balls secure allegiance,<br/>And dance the ladies to obedience.<br/>Oft his Camp-Muses he'll parade<br/>At Boston in the grand blockade;<br/>And well inspired with punch of arrack,<br/>Hold converse sweet in tent or barrack,<br/>Aroused to more poetic passion,<br/>Both by his theme and situation.<br/>For genius works more strong and clear<br/>When close confined, like bottled beer.<br/>So Prior's wit gain'd matchless power<br/>By inspiration of the Tower;<br/>And Raleigh, once to prison hurl'd,<br/>Wrote the whole hist'ry of the world;<br/>So Wilkes grew, while in jail he lay,<br/>More patriotic every day,<br/>But found his zeal, when not confined,<br/>Soon sink below the freezing point,<br/>And public spirit, once so fair,<br/>Evaporate in open air.<br/>But thou, great favourite of Venus,<br/>By no such luck shalt cramp thy genius;<br/>Thy friendly stars, till wars shall cease,<br/>Shall ward th' ill fortune of release,<br/>And hold thee fast in bonds not feeble,<br/>In good condition still to scribble.<br/>Such merit fate shall shield from firing,<br/>Bomb, carcase, langridge and cold iron,<br/>Nor trust thy doubly-laurell'd head,<br/>To rude assaults of flying lead.<br/>Hence thou, from Yankee troops retreating,<br/>For pure good fortune shalt be beaten,<br/>Not taken oft, released or rescued,<br/>Pass for small change, like simple Prescott;<br/>But captured then, as fates befall,<br/>Shall stand thy fortune, once for all.<br/>Then raise thy daring thoughts sublime,<br/>And dip thy conq'ring pen in rhyme,<br/>And changing war for puns and jokes,<br/>Write new Blockades and Maids of Oaks."<br/><br/><br/>This said, he turn'd and saw the tale<br/>Had dyed my trembling cheeks with pale;<br/>Then pitying in a milder vein,<br/>Pursued the visionary strain;<br/><br/><br/>"Too much perhaps hath pain'd your view,<br/>From vict'ries of the Rebel crew.<br/>Now see the deeds, not small or scanty,<br/>Of British valour and humanity;<br/>And learn from this heroic sight,<br/>How England's sons and friends can fight,<br/>In what dread scenes their courage grows,<br/>And how they conquer all their foes."<br/><br/><br/>I look'd, and saw in wintry skies<br/>Our spacious prison-walls arise,<br/>Where Britons, all their captives taming,<br/>Plied them with scourging, cold and famine,<br/>By noxious food and plagues contagious<br/>Reduced to life's last, fainting stages.<br/>Amid the dead, that crowd the scene,<br/>The moving skeletons were seen.<br/>Aloft the haughty Loring stood,<br/>And thrived, like Vampire, on their blood,<br/>And counting all his gains arising,<br/>Dealt daily rations out, of poison.<br/>At hand our troops, in vaunting strain,<br/>Insulted all their wants and pain,<br/>And turn'd upon the dying tribe<br/>The bitter taunt and scornful gibe;<br/>And British captains, chiefs of might,<br/>Exulting in the joyous sight,<br/>On foes disarm'd, with courage daring,<br/>Exhausted all their tropes of swearing.<br/>Distain'd around with rebel blood,<br/>Like Milton's Lazar house it stood,<br/>Where grim Despair presided Nurse,<br/>And Death was Regent of the house.<br/><br/><br/>Amazed I cried, "Is this the way<br/>That British valor wins the day?"<br/>More had I said in strains unwelcome,<br/>Till interrupted thus by Malcolm.<br/><br/><br/>"Blame not, said he, but learn the reason<br/>Of this new mode of conq'ring treason.<br/>'Tis but a wise, politic plan<br/>To root out all the rebel clan;<br/>For surely treason ne'er can thrive<br/>Where not a soul is left alive;<br/>A scheme all other chiefs to surpass,<br/>And do th' effectual work to purpose.<br/>Know, War itself is nothing further<br/>Than th' art and mystery of Murther;<br/>He, who most methods has essay'd,<br/>Is the best Gen'ral of the trade,<br/>And stands Death's plenipotentiary<br/>To conquer, poison, starve and bury.<br/>This Howe well knew and thus began;<br/>(Despising Carlton's coaxing plan,<br/>To keep his pris'ners well and merry,<br/>And deal them food, like commissary,<br/>And by parol or ransom vain,<br/>Dismiss them all to fight again)<br/>Hence his first captives, with great spirit<br/>He tied up, for his troops to fire at,<br/>And hoped they'd learn on foes thus taken,<br/>To aim at rebels without shaking.<br/>Then deep in stratagem, he plann'd<br/>The sure destruction of the land;<br/>Turn'd famine, torture and despair<br/>To useful enginry of war;<br/>Sent forth the small-pox, and the greater,<br/>To thin the land of every traitor;<br/>Spread desolation o'er their head,<br/>And plagues in providence's stead;<br/>Perform'd with equal skill and beauty<br/>Th' avenging Angel's tour of duty:<br/>Then bade these prison-walls arise,<br/>Like temple tow'ring to the skies,<br/>Where British Clemency renown'd<br/>Might fix her seat on hallow'd ground,<br/>(That Virtue, as each herald saith,<br/>Of whole blood kin to Punic Faith)<br/>Where all her godlike pow'rs unveiling,<br/>She finds a grateful shrine to dwell in:<br/>And at this altar for her honor,<br/>Chose this High-priest to wait upon her,<br/>Who with just rites, in ancient guise,<br/>Offers the human sacrifice.<br/>Here every day, her vot'ries tell,<br/>She more devours, than th' idol Bel;<br/>And thirsts more rav'nously for gore,<br/>Than any worshipp'd Power before.<br/>That ancient heathen godhead, Moloch,<br/>Oft stay'd his stomach with a bullock;<br/>And if his morning rage you'd check first,<br/>One child sufficed him for a breakfast:<br/>But British clemency with zeal<br/>Devours her hundreds at a meal;<br/>Right well by nat'ralists defined<br/>A being of carniv'rous kind:<br/>So erst Gargantua pleased his palate,<br/>And eat six pilgrims up in sallad.<br/>Not blest with maw less ceremonious<br/>The wide-mouth'd whale, that swallow'd Jonas;<br/>Like earthquake gapes, to death devote,<br/>That open sepulchre, her throat;<br/>The grave or barren womb you'd stuff,<br/>And sooner bring to cry, enough;<br/>Or fatten up to fair condition<br/>The lean-flesh'd kine of Pharaoh's vision.<br/><br/><br/>Behold her temple, where it stands<br/>Erect, by famed Britannic hands.<br/>'Tis the Black-hole of Indian structure,<br/>New-built in English architecture,<br/>On plan, 'tis said, contrived and wrote<br/>By Clive, before he cut his throat;<br/>Who, ere he took himself in hand,<br/>Was her high-priest in nabob-land:<br/>And when with conq'ring triumph crown'd,<br/>He'd well enslaved the nation round,<br/>With tender British heart, the Chief,<br/>Since slavery's worse than loss of life,<br/>Bade desolation circle far,<br/>And famine end the work of war;<br/>And loosed their chains, and for their merits<br/>Dismiss'd them free to worlds of spirits.<br/>Whence they with choral hymns of praise,<br/>Return'd to sooth his latter days,<br/>And hov'ring round his restless bed,<br/>Spread nightly visions o'er his head.<br/><br/><br/>Now turn thine eyes to nobler sights,<br/>And mark the prowess of our fights.<br/>Behold, like whelps of Britain's lion,<br/>Our warriors, Clinton, Vaughan, and Tryon,<br/>March forth with patriotic joy<br/>To ravish, plunder, burn, destroy.<br/>Great Gen'rals, foremost in their nation,<br/>The journeymen of Desolation!<br/>Like Samson's foxes, each assails,<br/>Let loose with firebrands in their tails,<br/>And spreads destruction more forlorn,<br/>Than they among Philistine corn.<br/>And see in flames their triumphs rise,<br/>Illuming all the nether skies,<br/>O'er-streaming, like a new Aurora,<br/>The western hemisphere with glory!<br/>What towns, in ashes laid, confess<br/>These heroes' prowess and success!<br/>What blacken'd walls and burning fanes,<br/>For trophies spread the ruin'd plains!<br/>What females, caught in evil hour,<br/>By force submit to British power;<br/>Or plunder'd negroes in disaster<br/>Confess King George their lord and master!<br/>What crimson corses strew their way,<br/>What smoaking carnage dims the day!<br/>Along the shore, for sure reduction,<br/>They wield the besom of destruction.<br/>Great Homer likens, in his Ilias,<br/>To dogstar bright the fierce Achilles;<br/>But ne'er beheld in red procession<br/>Three dogstars rise in constellation,<br/>Nor saw, in glooms of evening misty,<br/>Such signs of fiery triplicity,<br/>Which, far beyond the comet's tail,<br/>Portend destruction where they sail.<br/>Oh, had Great-Britain's warlike shore<br/>Produced but ten such heroes more,<br/>They'd spared the pains, and held the station<br/>Of this world's final conflagration;<br/>Which when its time comes, at a stand,<br/>Would find its work all done t' its hand!<br/><br/><br/>Yet though gay hopes our eyes may bless,<br/>Malignant fate forbids success;<br/>Like morning dreams our conquest flies,<br/>Dispersed before the dawn arise."<br/><br/><br/>Here Malcolm paused; when pond'ring long<br/>Grief thus gave utt'rance to my tongue.<br/>"Where shrink in fear our friends dismay'd,<br/>And where the Tories' promised aid?<br/>Can none, amid these fierce alarms,<br/>Assist the power of royal arms?"<br/>"In vain, he cried, our King depends<br/>On promised aid of Tory friends.<br/>When our own efforts want success,<br/>Friends ever fail, as fears increase.<br/>As leaves, in blooming verdure wove,<br/>In warmth of summer clothe the grove,<br/>But when autumnal frosts arise,<br/>Leave bare their trunks to wintry skies:<br/>So, while your power can aid their ends,<br/>You ne'er can need ten thousand friends;<br/>But once in want, by foes dismay'd,<br/>May advertise them, stol'n or stray'd.<br/>Thus ere Great-Britain's force grew slack,<br/>She gain'd that aid she did not lack;<br/>But now in dread, imploring pity,<br/>All hear unmoved her dol'rous ditty;<br/>Allegiance wand'ring turns astray,<br/>And Faith grows dim for lack of pay.<br/>In vain she tries, by new inventions,<br/>Fear, falsehood, flatt'ry, threats and pensions;<br/>Or sends Commiss'ners with credentials<br/>Of promises and penitentials.<br/>As, for his fare o'er Styx of old,<br/>The Trojan stole the bough of gold,<br/>And least grim Cerb'rus should make head,<br/>Stuff'd both his fobs with ginger-bread:<br/>Behold, at Britain's utmost shifts,<br/>Comes Johnstone loaded with like gifts,<br/>To venture through the whiggish tribe,<br/>To cuddle, wheedle, coax and bribe:<br/>And call, to aid his desp'rate mission,<br/>His petticoated politician,<br/>While Venus, join'd to act the farce,<br/>Strolls forth embassadress for Mars.<br/>In vain he strives, for while he lingers,<br/>These mastiffs bite his off'ring fingers;<br/>Nor buys for George and realms infernal<br/>One spaniel, but the mongrel, Arnold.<br/><br/><br/>"'Twere vain to paint, in vision'd show,<br/>The mighty nothings done by Howe;<br/>What towns he takes in mortal fray,<br/>As stations whence to run away;<br/>What triumphs gain'd in conflict warm,<br/>No aid to us, to them no harm;<br/>For still th' event alike is fatal,<br/>Whate'er success attend the battle,<br/>Whether he vict'ry gain or lose it,<br/>Who ne'er had skill enough to use it.<br/>And better 'twere, at their expense,<br/>T' have drubb'd him into common sense,<br/>And waked, by bastings on his rear,<br/>Th' activity, though but of fear.<br/>By slow advance his arms prevail,<br/>Like emblematic march of snail,<br/>That, be Millennium nigh or far,<br/>'Twould long before him end the war.<br/>From York to Philadelphian ground,<br/>He sweeps the pompous flourish round,<br/>Wheel'd circ'lar by eccentric stars,<br/>Like racing boys at prison-bars,<br/>Who take th' opposing crew in whole,<br/>By running round the adverse goal;<br/>Works wide the traverse of his course,<br/>Like ship t' evade the tempest's force;<br/>Like mill-horse circling in his race,<br/>Advances not a single pace,<br/>And leaves no trophies of reduction,<br/>Save that of cankerworms, destruction.<br/>Thus having long both countries curst,<br/>He quits them as he found them first,<br/>Steers home disgraced, of little worth,<br/>To join Burgoyne and rail at North.<br/><br/><br/>"Now raise thine eyes and view with pleasure,<br/>The triumphs of his famed successor."<br/><br/><br/>"I look'd, and now by magic lore<br/>Faint rose to view the Jersey shore:<br/>But dimly seen in gloom array'd,<br/>For night had pour'd her sable shade,<br/>And every star, with glimm'rings pale,<br/>Was muffled deep in ev'ning veil.<br/>Scarce visible, in dusky night<br/>Advancing red-coats rose in sight;<br/>The length'ning train in gleaming rows<br/>Stole silent from their slumb'ring foes;<br/>No trembling soldier dared to speak,<br/>And not a wheel presumed to creak.<br/>My looks my new surprize confess'd,<br/>Till by great Malcolm thus address'd.<br/>"Spend not thy wits in vain researches;<br/>'Tis one of Clinton's moonlight marches.<br/>From Philadelphia now retreating<br/>To save his baffled troops a beating,<br/>With hasty strides he flies in vain,<br/>His rear attack'd on Monmouth plain.<br/>With various chance the dread affray<br/>Holds in suspense till close of day,<br/>When his tired bands, o'ermatch'd in fight,<br/>Are rescued by descending night.<br/>He forms his camp, with great parade,<br/>While evening spreads the world in shade,<br/>Then still, like some endanger'd spark,<br/>Steals off on tiptoe in the dark:<br/>Yet writes his king in boasting tone<br/>How grand he march'd by light of moon.<br/>I see him, but thou canst not; proud<br/>He leads in front the trembling crowd,<br/>And wisely knows, as danger's near,<br/>'Twill fall much heaviest on his rear.<br/>Go on, great Gen'ral, nor regard<br/>The scoffs of every scribbling bard;<br/>Who sings how gods, that fearful night,<br/>Aided by miracle your flight,<br/>As once they used, in Homer's day,<br/>To help weak heroes run away;<br/>Tells how the hours, at this sad trial,<br/>Went back, as erst on Ahaz' dial,<br/>While British Joshua stay'd the moon<br/>On Monmouth plains for Ajalon.<br/>Heed not their sneers or gibes so arch,<br/>Because she set before your march.<br/>A small mistake! your meaning right;<br/>You take her influence for her light:<br/>Her influence, which shall be your guide,<br/>And o'er your Gen'ralship preside.<br/>Hence still shall teem your empty skull<br/>With vict'ries, when the moon's at full,<br/>Which by transition passing strange<br/>Wane to defeats before the change.<br/>Still shall you steer, on land or ocean,<br/>By like eccentric lunar motion;<br/>Eclips'd in many a fatal crisis,<br/>And dimm'd when Washington arises.<br/><br/><br/>"And see how Fate, herself turn'd traitor,<br/>Inverts the ancient course of nature;<br/>And changes manners, tempers, climes,<br/>To suit the genius of the times!<br/>See, Bourbon forms a gen'rous plan,<br/>New guardian of the rights of man,<br/>And prompt in firm alliance joins<br/>To aid the Rebels' proud designs!<br/>Behold from realms of eastern day<br/>His sails innum'rous shape their way,<br/>In warlike line the billows sweep,<br/>And roll the thunders of the deep!<br/>See, low in equinoctial skies,<br/>The western islands fall their prize;<br/>See British flags, o'ermatch'd in might,<br/>Put all their faith in instant flight,<br/>Or broken squadrons, from th' affray,<br/>Drag slow their wounded hulks away!<br/>Behold his Chiefs, in daring setts,<br/>D'Estaignes, De Grasses and Fayettes,<br/>Spread through our camps their dread alarms,<br/>And swell the fear of rebel arms!<br/>Yet ere our glories sink in night,<br/>A gleam of hope shall strike your sight;<br/>As lamps, that fail of oil and fire,<br/>Collect one glimm'ring to expire.<br/><br/><br/>"For lo, where southern shores extend,<br/>Behold our gather'd hosts descend,<br/>Where Charleston views, with varying beams<br/>Her turrets gild th' encircling streams!<br/>There by superior force compell'd,<br/>Behold their gallant Lincoln yield;<br/>Nor aught the wreaths avail him now,<br/>Pluck'd from Burgoyne's imperious brow.<br/>See, furious from the vanquish'd strand,<br/>Cornwallis leads his mighty band;<br/>The southern realms and Georgian shore<br/>Submit and own the victor's power;<br/>Lo! sunk before his wasting way,<br/>The Carolinas fall his prey!<br/>See, shrinking from his conq'ring eye,<br/>The Rebel legions fall or fly;<br/>And with'ring in these torrid skies,<br/>The northern laurel fades and dies!<br/>With rapid force he leads his train<br/>To fair Virginia's cultured plain,<br/>Triumphant eyes the travell'd zone,<br/>And boasts the southern realm his own.<br/><br/><br/>"Nor yet this hero's glories bright<br/>Blaze only in the fields of fight.<br/>Not Howe's humanity more deserving<br/>In gifts of hanging and of starving;<br/>Not Arnold plunders more tobacco,<br/>Or steals more negroes for Jamaica;<br/>Scarce Rodney's self, among th' Eustatians,<br/>Insults so well the laws of nations;<br/>Ev'n Tryon's fame grows dim, and mourning<br/>He yields the civic crown of burning.<br/>I see, with pleasure and surprize,<br/>New triumph sparkling in your eyes;<br/>But view, where now renew'd in might,<br/>Again the Rebels dare the fight."<br/>"I look'd, and far in southern skies<br/>Saw Greene, their second hope, arise,<br/>And with his small, but gallant, band.<br/>Invade the Carolinian land.<br/>As winds, in stormy circles whirl'd,<br/>Rush billowy o'er the darken'd world,<br/>And where their wasting fury roves<br/>Successive sweep th' astonish'd groves:<br/>Thus where he pours the rapid fight,<br/>Our boasted conquests sink in night,<br/>And far o'er all the extended field<br/>Our forts resign, our armies yield,<br/>Till now, regain'd the vanquish'd land,<br/>He lifts his standard on the strand.<br/><br/><br/>"Again to fair Virginia's coast<br/>I turn'd and view'd the British host,<br/>Where Chesapeak's wide waters lave<br/>Her shores and join th' Atlantic wave.<br/>There famed Cornwallis tow'ring rose,<br/>And scorn'd secure his distant foes;<br/>His bands the haughty rampart raise,<br/>And bid the Royal standard blaze.<br/>When lo, where ocean's bounds extend,<br/>Behold the Gallic sails ascend,<br/>With fav'ring breezes stem their way,<br/>And crowd with ships the spacious bay.<br/>Lo! Washington, from northern shores,<br/>O'er many a region wheels his force,<br/>And Rochambeau, with legions bright,<br/>Descends in terror to the fight.<br/>Not swifter cleaves his rapid way<br/>The eagle, cow'ring o'er his prey;<br/>Or knights in famed romance, that fly<br/>On fairy pinions through the sky.<br/>Amazed, the Briton's startled pride<br/>Sees ruin wake on every side,<br/>And all his troops, to fate consign'd,<br/>By instantaneous stroke, Burgoyned.<br/>Not Cadmus view'd with more surprise,<br/>From earth embattled armies rise,<br/>Who from the dragon's teeth beheld<br/>Men starting fierce with spear and shield.<br/>I saw, with looks downcast and grave,<br/>The Chief emerging from his cave,<br/>Where chased, like fox, in mighty round,<br/>His hunters earth'd him first in ground;<br/>And doom'd by fate to rebel sway,<br/>Yield all his captured host a prey.<br/>There while I view'd the vanquish'd town,<br/>Thus with a sigh my friend went on."<br/><br/><br/>"Behold'st thou not that band forlorn,<br/>Like slaves in Roman triumphs borne,<br/>Their faces length'ning with their fears,<br/>And cheeks distain'd with streams of tears;<br/>Like dramatis person√¶ sage,<br/>Equipp'd to act on Tyburn's stage.<br/>Lo, these are they, who lured by follies<br/>Left all, and follow'd great Cornwallis,<br/>Expectant of the promised glories,<br/>And new Millennial reign of Tories!<br/>Alas! in vain, all doubts forgetting,<br/>They tried th' omnipotence of Britain;<br/>But found her arm, once strong and brave,<br/>So shorten'd now, she cannot save.<br/>Not more aghast, departed souls<br/>Who risk'd their fate on Popish bulls,<br/>And find St. Peter, at the wicket,<br/>Refuse to countersign their ticket,<br/>When driven to purgatory back,<br/>With each his pardon in his pack;<br/>Than Tories, must'ring at their stations,<br/>On faith of royal proclamations.<br/>As Pagan chiefs at every crisis,<br/>Confirm'd their leagues by sacrifices,<br/>And herds of beasts, to all their deities,<br/>Oblations fell, at close of treaties:<br/>Cornwallis thus, in ancient fashion,<br/>Concludes his grand capitulation;<br/>And heedless of their screams or suff'rings,<br/>Gives up the Tories for sin-off'rings.<br/>See where, relieved from sad embargo,<br/>Steer off consign'd a recreant cargo;<br/>Like old scape-goats to roam in pain,<br/>Mark'd like their great forerunner, Cain.<br/>The rest now doom'd by British leagues<br/>To vengeance of resentful Whigs,<br/>Hold doubtful lives on tenure ill<br/>Of tenancy at Rebel-will,<br/>While hov'ring o'er their forfeit persons,<br/>The gallows waits his just reversions.<br/><br/><br/>"Thou too, M'Fingal, ere that day,<br/>Shalt taste the terrors of th' affray.<br/>See, o'er thee hangs in angry skies,<br/>Where Whiggish Constellations rise,<br/>And while plebeian signs ascend,<br/>Their mob-inspiring aspects bend,<br/>That baleful Star, whose horrid hair<br/>Shakes forth the plagues of down and tar!<br/>I see the pole, that rears on high<br/>Its flag terrific through the sky;<br/>The mob beneath prepared t' attack,<br/>And tar predestined for thy back.<br/>Ah quit, my friend, this dang'rous home,<br/>Nor wait the darker scenes to come.<br/>For know, that fate's auspicious door,<br/>Once shut to flight, is oped no more;<br/>Nor wears its hinge, by changing stations,<br/>Like Mercy's door in Proclamations.<br/><br/><br/>"But lest thou pause, or doubt to fly,<br/>To stranger visions turn thine eye.<br/>Each cloud, that dimm'd thy mental ray,<br/>And all the mortal mists decay.<br/>See, more than human pow'rs befriend,<br/>And lo! their hostile forms ascend.<br/>There tow'ring o'er the extended strand,<br/>The Genius of this western land,<br/>For vengeance arm'd, his sword assumes,<br/>And stands, like Tories, dress'd in plumes!<br/>See, o'er yon Council-seat, with pride<br/>How Freedom spreads her banners wide!<br/>There Patriotism, with torch address'd<br/>To fire with zeal each daring breast;<br/>While all the Virtues in their train,<br/>Escaped with pleasure o'er the main,<br/>Desert their ancient British station,<br/>Possess'd with rage of emigration.<br/>Honor, his bus'ness at a stand,<br/>For fear of starving quits their land;<br/>And Justice, long disgraced at Court, had<br/>By Mansfield's sentence been transported.<br/>Vict'ry and Fame attend their way,<br/>Though Britain wish their longer stay;<br/>Care not what George or North would be at,<br/>Nor heed their writs of Ne exeat;<br/>But fired with love of colonizing,<br/>Quit the fall'n empire for the rising."<br/><br/><br/>"I look'd, and saw, with horror smitten,<br/>These hostile pow'rs averse to Britain.<br/><br/><br/>"When lo, an awful spectre rose,<br/>With languid paleness on his brows;<br/>Wan dropsies swell'd his form beneath,<br/>And iced his bloated cheeks with death;<br/>His tatter'd robes exposed him bare<br/>To every blast of ruder air;<br/>On two weak crutches propp'd he stood,<br/>That bent at every step he trod;<br/>Gilt titles graced their sides so slender,<br/>One, "Regulation," t'other, "Tender;"<br/>His breastplate graved, with various dates,<br/>"The Faith of all th' United States;"<br/>Before him went his funeral pall,<br/>His grave stood, dug to wait his fall.<br/><br/><br/>"I started, and aghast I cried,<br/>"What means this spectre at their side?<br/>What danger from a pow'r so vain,<br/>Or union with that splendid train?"<br/><br/><br/>"Alas, great Malcolm cried, experience<br/>Might teach you not to trust appearance.<br/>Here stands, as dress'd by fell Bellona,<br/>The ghost of Continental Money!<br/>Of Dame Necessity descended,<br/>With whom Credulity engender'd:<br/>Though born with constitution frail,<br/>And feeble strength, that soon must fail,<br/>Yet strangely vers'd in magic lore,<br/>And gifted with transforming power.<br/>His skill the wealth Peruvian joins,<br/>With diamonds of Brazilian mines.<br/>As erst Jove fell, by subtle wiles,<br/>On Danae's apron through the tiles,<br/>In show'rs of gold; his potent wand<br/>Shall shed like show'rs o'er all the land.<br/>Less great the wondrous art was reckon'd<br/>Of tallies cast by Charles the second,<br/>Or Law's famed Missisippi schemes,<br/>Or all the wealth of South-Sea dreams.<br/>For he, of all the world, alone<br/>Owns the long-sought Philos'pher's stone,<br/>Restores the fabulous times to view,<br/>And proves the tale of Midas true.<br/>O'er heaps of rags he waves his wand;<br/>All turn to gold at his command,<br/>Provide for present wants and future,<br/>Raise armies, victual, clothe, accoutre,<br/>Adjourn our conquests by essoin,<br/>Check Howe's advance, and take Burgoyne;<br/>Then makes all days of payment vain,<br/>And turns all back to rags again.<br/>In vain great Howe shall play his part<br/>To ape and counterfeit his art;<br/>In vain shall Clinton, more belated,<br/>A conj'rer turn to imitate it.<br/>With like ill luck and pow'rs as narrow,<br/>They'll fare, like sorcerers of old Pharaoh;<br/>Who, though the art they understood<br/>Of turning rivers into blood,<br/>And caused their frogs and snakes t' exist,<br/>That with some merit croak'd and hiss'd,<br/>Yet ne'er by every quaint device<br/>Could frame the true Mosaic lice.<br/>He for the Whigs his arts shall try,<br/>Their first, and long their sole, ally;<br/>A Patriot firm, while breath he draws,<br/>He'll perish in his Country's cause,<br/>And when his magic labors cease,<br/>Lie buried in eternal peace.<br/><br/><br/>Now view the scenes, in future hours,<br/>That wait the famed European powers.<br/>See, where yon chalky cliffs arise,<br/>The hills of Britain strike your eyes;<br/>Its small extension long supplied<br/>By full immensity of pride;<br/>So small, that had it found a station<br/>In this new world, at first creation,<br/>Or doom'd by justice, been betimes<br/>Transported over for its crimes,<br/>We'd find full room for't in lake Erie, or<br/>That larger water-pond, Superior,<br/>Where North at margin taking stand,<br/>Would scarce be able to spy land.<br/>See, dwindling from her height amain,<br/>What piles of ruin spread the plain;<br/>With mould'ring hulks her ports are fill'd,<br/>And brambles clothe the lonely field!<br/>See, on her cliffs her Genius lies,<br/>His handkerchief at both his eyes,<br/>With many a deep-drawn sigh and groan,<br/>To mourn her ruin, and his own!<br/>While joyous Holland, France and Spain<br/>With conq'ring navies awe the main;<br/>And Russian banners wide unfurl'd<br/>Spread commerce round the eastern world.<br/><br/><br/>And see, (sight hateful and tormenting!)<br/>This Rebel Empire, proud and vaunting,<br/>From anarchy shall change her crasis,<br/>And fix her pow'r on firmer basis;<br/>To glory, wealth and fame ascend,<br/>Her commerce wake, her realms extend;<br/>Where now the panther guards his den,<br/>Her desert forests swarm with men;<br/>Gay cities, tow'rs and columns rise,<br/>And dazzling temples meet the skies;<br/>Her pines, descending to the main,<br/>In triumph spread the wat'ry plain,<br/>Ride inland seas with fav'ring gales,<br/>And crowd her ports with whitening sails:<br/>Till to the skirts of western day,<br/>The peopled regions own her sway."<br/><br/><br/>Thus far M'Fingal told his tale,<br/>When startling shouts his ears assail;<br/>And strait the Constable, their sentry,<br/>Aghast rush'd headlong down the entry,<br/>And with wild outcry, like magician,<br/>Dispersed the residue of vision.<br/>For now the Whigs the news had found<br/>Of Tories must'ring under ground,<br/>And with rude bangs and loud uproar,<br/>'Gan thunder furious at the door.<br/>The lights put out, each tory calls,<br/>To cover him on cellar walls,<br/>Creeps in each box, or bin, or tub,<br/>To hide him from the rage of mob,<br/>Or lurks, where cabbage-heads in row<br/>Adorn'd the sides with verdant show.<br/>M'Fingal deem'd it vain to stay,<br/>And risk his bones in second fray:<br/>But chose a grand retreat from foes,<br/>In literal sense, beneath their nose.<br/>The window then, which none else knew,<br/>He softly open'd and crept through,<br/>And crawling slow in deadly fear,<br/>By movements wise made good his rear.<br/>Then scorning all the fame of martyr,<br/>For Boston took his swift departure,<br/>Nor look'd back on the fatal spot,<br/>More than the family of Lot.<br/>Not North in more distress'd condition,<br/>Out-voted first by opposition;<br/>Nor good King George, when our dire phantom<br/>Of Independence came to haunt him,<br/>Which hov'ring round by night and day,<br/>Not all his conj'rors e'er could lay.<br/>His friends, assembled for his sake,<br/>He wisely left in pawn, at stake,<br/>To tarring, feath'ring, kicks and drubs<br/>Of furious, disappointed mobs,<br/>Or with their forfeit heads to pay<br/>For him, their leader, crept away.<br/>So when wise Noah summon'd greeting,<br/>All animals to gen'ral meeting,<br/>From every side the members went,<br/>All kinds of beasts to represent;<br/>Each, from the flood, took care t' embark,<br/>And save his carcase in the ark:<br/>But as it fares in state and church,<br/>Left his constituents in the lurch.
