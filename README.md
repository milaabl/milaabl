# üíÆ Parisina by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    It is the hour when from the boughs<br/>  The nightingale's high note is heard;<br/>It is the hour when lovers' vows<br/>  Seem sweet in every whispered word;<br/>And gentle winds, and waters near,<br/>Make music to the lonely ear.<br/>Each flower the dews have lightly wet,<br/>And in the sky the stars are met,<br/>And on the wave is deeper blue,<br/>And on the leaf a browner hue,<br/>And in the heaven that clear obscure,<br/>So softly dark, and darkly pure,<br/>Which follows the decline of day,<br/>As twilight melts beneath the moon away.<br/><br/>But it is not to list to the waterfall<br/>That Parisina leaves her hall,<br/>And it is not to gaze on the heavenly light<br/>That the Lady walks in the shadow of night;<br/>And if she sits in Este's bower,<br/>'Tis not for the sake of its full-blown flower;<br/>She listens--but not for the nightingale--<br/>Though her ear expects as soft a tale.<br/>There glides a step through the foliage thick,<br/>And her cheek grows pale, and her heart beats quick.<br/>There whispers a voice through the rustling leaves,<br/>And her blush returns, and her bosom heaves:<br/>A moment more--and they shall meet--<br/>'Tis past--her Lover's at her feet.<br/><br/>And what unto them is the world beside,<br/>With all its change of time and tide?<br/>Its living things--its earth and sky--<br/>Are nothing to their mind and eye.<br/>And heedless as the dead are they<br/>  Of aught around, above, beneath;<br/>As if all else had passed away,<br/>  They only for each other breathe;<br/>Their very sighs are full of joy<br/>  So deep, that did it not decay,<br/>That happy madness would destroy<br/>  The hearts which feel its fiery sway:<br/>Of guilt, of peril, do they deem<br/>In that tumultuous tender dream?<br/>Who that have felt that passion's power,<br/>Or paused, or feared in such an hour?<br/>Or thought how brief such moments last?<br/>But yet--they are already past!<br/>Alas! we must awake before<br/>We know such vision comes no more.<br/><br/>With many a lingering look they leave<br/>  The spot of guilty gladness past:<br/>And though they hope, and vow, they grieve,<br/>  As if that parting were the last.<br/>The frequent sigh--the long embrace--<br/>  The lip that there would cling for ever,<br/>While gleams on Parisina's face<br/>  The Heaven she fears will not forgive her,<br/>As if each calmly conscious star<br/>Beheld her frailty from afar--<br/>The frequent sigh, the long embrace,<br/>Yet binds them to their trysting-place.<br/>But it must come, and they must part<br/>In fearful heaviness of heart,<br/>With all the deep and shuddering chill<br/>Which follows fast the deeds of ill.<br/><br/>And Hugo is gone to his lonely bed,<br/>  To covet there another's bride;<br/>But she must lay her conscious head<br/>  A husband's trusting heart beside.<br/>But fevered in her sleep she seems,<br/>And red her cheek with troubled dreams,<br/>  And mutters she in her unrest<br/>A name she dare not breathe by day,<br/>  And clasps her Lord unto the breast<br/>Which pants for one away:<br/>And he to that embrace awakes,<br/>And, happy in the thought, mistakes<br/>That dreaming sigh, and warm caress,<br/>For such as he was wont to bless;<br/>And could in very fondness weep<br/>O'er her who loves him even in sleep.<br/><br/>He clasped her sleeping to his heart,<br/>  And listened to each broken word:<br/>He hears--Why doth Prince Azo start,<br/>  As if the Archangel's voice he heard?<br/>And well he may--a deeper doom<br/>Could scarcely thunder o'er his tomb,<br/>When he shall wake to sleep no more,<br/>And stand the eternal throne before.<br/>And well he may--his earthly peace<br/>Upon that sound is doomed to cease.<br/>That sleeping whisper of a name<br/>Bespeaks her guilt and Azo's shame.<br/>And whose that name? that o'er his pillow<br/>Sounds fearful as the breaking billow,<br/>Which rolls the plank upon the shore,<br/>  And dashes on the pointed rock<br/>The wretch who sinks to rise no more,--<br/>  So came upon his soul the shock.<br/>And whose that name?--'tis Hugo's,--his--<br/>In sooth he had not deemed of this!--<br/>'Tis Hugo's,--he, the child of one<br/>He loved--his own all-evil son--<br/>The offspring of his wayward youth,<br/>When he betrayed Bianca's truth,<br/>The maid whose folly could confide<br/>In him who made her not his bride.<br/><br/>He plucked his poniard in its sheath,<br/>  But sheathed it ere the point was bare;<br/>Howe'er unworthy now to breathe,<br/>  He could not slay a thing so fair--<br/>  At least, not smiling--sleeping--there--<br/>Nay, more:--he did not wake her then,<br/>  But gazed upon her with a glance<br/>  Which, had she roused her from her trance,<br/>Had frozen her sense to sleep again;<br/>And o'er his brow the burning lamp<br/>Gleamed on the dew-drops big and damp.<br/>She spake no more--but still she slumbered--<br/>While, in his thought, her days are numbered.<br/><br/>And with the morn he sought and found,<br/>In many a tale from those around,<br/>The proof of all he feared to know,<br/>Their present guilt--his future woe;<br/>The long-conniving damsels seek<br/>  To save themselves, and would transfer<br/>  The guilt--the shame--the doom--to her:<br/>Concealment is no more--they speak<br/>All circumstance which may compel<br/>Full credence to the tale they tell:<br/>And Azo's tortured heart and ear<br/>Have nothing more to feel or hear.<br/><br/>He was not one who brooked delay:<br/>  Within the chamber of his state,<br/>The Chief of Este's ancient sway<br/>  Upon his throne of judgement sate;<br/>His nobles and his guards are there,--<br/>Before him is the sinful pair;<br/>Both young,--and _one_ how passing fair!<br/>With swordless belt, and fettered hand,<br/>Oh, Christ! that thus a son should stand<br/>  Before a father's face!<br/>Yet thus must Hugo meet his sire,<br/>And hear the sentence of his ire,<br/>  The tale of his disgrace!<br/>And yet he seems not overcome,<br/>Although, as yet, his voice be dumb.<br/><br/>And still,--and pale--and silently<br/>  Did Parisina wait her doom;<br/>How changed since last her speaking eye<br/>  Glanced gladness round the glittering room,<br/>Where high-born men were proud to wait--<br/>Where Beauty watched to imitate<br/>  Her gentle voice--her lovely mien--<br/>And gather from her air and gait<br/>  The graces of its Queen:<br/>Then,--had her eye in sorrow wept,<br/>A thousand warriors forth had leapt,<br/>A thousand swords had sheathless shone,<br/>And made her quarrel all their own.<br/>Now,--what is she? and what are they?<br/>Can she command, or these obey?<br/>All silent and unheeding now,<br/>With downcast eyes and knitting brow,<br/>And folded arms, and freezing air,<br/>And lips that scarce their scorn forbear,<br/>Her knights, her dames, her court--is there:<br/>And he--the chosen one, whose lance<br/>Had yet been couched before her glance,<br/>Who--were his arm a moment free--<br/>Had died or gained her liberty;<br/>The minion of his father's bride,--<br/>He, too, is fettered by her side;<br/>Nor sees her swoln and full eye swim<br/>Less for her own despair than him:<br/>Those lids--o'er which the violet vein<br/>Wandering, leaves a tender stain,<br/>Shining through the smoothest white<br/>That e'er did softest kiss invite--<br/>Now seemed with hot and livid glow<br/>To press, not shade, the orbs below;<br/>Which glance so heavily, and fill,<br/>As tear on tear grows gathering still<br/><br/>And he for her had also wept,<br/>  But for the eyes that on him gazed:<br/>His sorrow, if he felt it, slept;<br/>  Stern and erect his brow was raised.<br/>Whate'er the grief his soul avowed,<br/>He would not shrink before the crowd;<br/>But yet he dared not look on her;<br/>Remembrance of the hours that were--<br/>His guilt--his love--his present state--<br/>His father's wrath, all good men's hate--<br/>His earthly, his eternal fate--<br/>And hers,--oh, hers! he dared not throw<br/>One look upon that death-like brow!<br/>Else had his rising heart betrayed<br/>Remorse for all the wreck it made.<br/><br/>And Azo spake:--"But yesterday<br/>  I gloried in a wife and son;<br/>That dream this morning passed away;<br/>  Ere day declines, I shall have none.<br/>My life must linger on alone;<br/>Well,--let that pass,--there breathes not one<br/>Who would not do as I have done:<br/>Those ties are broken--not by me;<br/>  Let that too pass;--the doom's prepared!<br/>Hugo, the priest awaits on thee,<br/>  And then--thy crime's reward!<br/>Away! address thy prayers to Heaven.<br/>  Before its evening stars are met,<br/>Learn if thou there canst be forgiven:<br/>  Its mercy may absolve thee yet.<br/>But here, upon the earth beneath,<br/>  There is no spot where thou and I<br/>Together for an hour could breathe:<br/>  Farewell! I will not see thee die--<br/>But thou, frail thing! shall view his head--<br/>  Away! I cannot speak the rest:<br/>  Go! woman of the wanton breast;<br/>Not I, but thou his blood dost shed:<br/>Go! if that sight thou canst outlive,<br/>And joy thee in the life I give."<br/><br/>And here stern Azo hid his face--<br/>  For on his brow the swelling vein<br/>  Throbbed as if back upon his brain<br/>  The hot blood ebbed and flowed again;<br/>And therefore bowed he for a space,<br/>  And passed his shaking hand along<br/>  His eye, to veil it from the throng;<br/>While Hugo raised his chain√©d hands,<br/>And for a brief delay demands<br/>His father's ear: the silent sire<br/>Forbids not what his words require.<br/>  "It is not that I dread the death--<br/>For thou hast seen me by thy side<br/>All redly through the battle ride,<br/>And that--not once a useless brand--<br/>Thy slaves have wrested from my hand<br/>Hath shed more blood in cause of thine,<br/>Than e'er can stain the axe of mine:<br/>  Thou gav'st, and may'st resume my breath,<br/>A gift for which I thank thee not;<br/>Nor are my mother's wrongs forgot,<br/>Her slighted love and ruined name,<br/>Her offspring's heritage of shame;<br/>But she is in the grave, where he,<br/>Her son--thy rival--soon shall be.<br/>Her broken heart--my severed head--<br/>Shall witness for thee from the dead<br/>How trusty and how tender were<br/>Thy youthful love--paternal care.<br/>'Tis true that I have done thee wrong--<br/>  But wrong for wrong:--this,--deemed thy bride,<br/>  The other victim of thy pride,--<br/>Thou know'st for me was destined long;<br/>Thou saw'st, and coveted'st her charms;<br/>  And with thy very crime--my birth,--<br/>  Thou taunted'st me--as little worth;<br/>A match ignoble for her arms;<br/>Because, forsooth, I could not claim<br/>The lawful heirship of thy name,<br/>Nor sit on Este's lineal throne;<br/>  Yet, were a few short summers mine,<br/>  My name should more than Este's shine<br/>With honours all my own.<br/>I had a sword--and have a breast<br/>That should have won as haught a crest<br/>As ever waved along the line<br/>Of all these sovereign sires of thine.<br/>Not always knightly spurs are worn<br/>The brightest by the better born;<br/>And mine have lanced my courser's flank<br/>Before proud chiefs of princely rank,<br/>When charging to the cheering cry<br/>Of 'Este and of Victory!'<br/>I will not plead the cause of crime,<br/>Nor sue thee to redeem from time<br/>A few brief hours or days that must<br/>At length roll o'er my reckless dust;--<br/>Such maddening moments as my past,<br/>They could not, and they did not, last;--<br/>Albeit my birth and name be base,<br/>And thy nobility of race<br/>Disdained to deck a thing like me--<br/>  Yet in my lineaments they trace<br/>  Some features of my father's face,<br/>And in my spirit--all of thee.<br/>From thee this tamelessness of heart--<br/>From thee--nay, wherefore dost thou start?---<br/>From thee in all their vigour came<br/>My arm of strength, my soul of flame--<br/>Thou didst not give me life alone,<br/>But all that made me more thine own.<br/>See what thy guilty love hath done!<br/>Repaid thee with too like a son!<br/>I am no bastard in my soul,<br/>For that, like thine, abhorred control;<br/>And for my breath, that hasty boon<br/>Thou gav'st and wilt resume so soon,<br/>I valued it no more than thou,<br/>When rose thy casque above thy brow,<br/>And we, all side by side, have striven,<br/>And o'er the dead our coursers driven:<br/>The past is nothing--and at last<br/>The future can but be the past;<br/>Yet would I that I then had died:<br/>  For though thou work'dst my mother's ill,<br/>And made thy own my destined bride,<br/>  I feel thou art my father still:<br/>And harsh as sounds thy hard decree,<br/>'Tis not unjust, although from thee.<br/>Begot in sin, to die in shame,<br/>My life begun and ends the same:<br/>As erred the sire, so erred the son,<br/>And thou must punish both in one.<br/>My crime seems worst to human view,<br/>But God must judge between us too!"<br/><br/>He ceased--and stood with folded arms,<br/>  On which the circling fetters sounded;<br/>  And not an ear but felt as wounded,<br/>  Of all the chiefs that there were ranked,<br/>  When those dull chains in meeting clanked:<br/>Till Parisina's fatal charms<br/>Again attracted every eye--<br/>Would she thus hear him doomed to die!<br/>She stood, I said, all pale and still,<br/>The living cause of Hugo's ill:<br/>Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,<br/>Not once had turned to either side--<br/>Nor once did those sweet eyelids close,<br/>Or shade the glance o'er which they rose,<br/>But round their orbs of deepest blue<br/>The circling white dilated grew--<br/>And there with glassy gaze she stood<br/>As ice were in her curdled blood;<br/>But every now and then a tear<br/>  So large and slowly gathered slid<br/>  From the long dark fringe of that fair lid,<br/>It was a thing to see, not hear!<br/>And those who saw, it did surprise,<br/>Such drops could fall from human eyes.<br/>To speak she thought--the imperfect note<br/>Was choked within her swelling throat,<br/>Yet seemed in that low hollow groan<br/>Her whole heart gushing in the tone.<br/>It ceased--again she thought to speak,<br/>Then burst her voice in one long shriek,<br/>And to the earth she fell like stone<br/>Or statue from its base o'erthrown,<br/>More like a thing that ne'er had life,--<br/>A monument of Azo's wife,--<br/>Than her, that living guilty thing,<br/>Whose every passion was a sting,<br/>Which urged to guilt, but could not bear<br/>That guilt's detection and despair.<br/>But yet she lived--and all too soon<br/>Recovered from that death-like swoon--<br/>But scarce to reason--every sense<br/>Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense;<br/>And each frail fibre of her brain<br/>(As bowstrings, when relaxed by rain,<br/>The erring arrow launch aside)<br/>Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide--<br/>The past a blank, the future black,<br/>With glimpses of a dreary track,<br/>Like lightning on the desert path,<br/>When midnight storms are mustering wrath.<br/>She feared--she felt that something ill<br/>Lay on her soul, so deep and chill;<br/>That there was sin and shame she knew,<br/>That some one was to die--but who?<br/>She had forgotten:--did she breathe?<br/>Could this be still the earth beneath,<br/>The sky above, and men around;<br/>Or were they fiends who now so frowned<br/>On one, before whose eyes each eye<br/>Till then had smiled in sympathy?<br/>All was confused and undefined<br/>To her all-jarred and wandering mind;<br/>A chaos of wild hopes and fears:<br/>And now in laughter, now in tears,<br/>But madly still in each extreme,<br/>She strove with that convulsive dream;<br/>For so it seemed on her to break:<br/>Oh! vainly must she strive to wake!<br/><br/>The Convent bells are ringing,<br/>  But mournfully and slow;<br/>In the grey square turret swinging,<br/>  With a deep sound, to and fro.<br/>  Heavily to the heart they go!<br/>Hark! the hymn is singing--<br/>  The song for the dead below,<br/>  Or the living who shortly shall be so!<br/>For a departed being's soul<br/>The death-hymn peals and the hollow bells knoll:<br/>He is near his mortal goal;<br/>Kneeling at the Friar's knee,<br/>Sad to hear, and piteous to see--<br/>Kneeling on the bare cold ground.<br/>With the block before and the guards around;<br/>And the headsman with his bare arm ready,<br/>That the blow may be both swift and steady,<br/>Feels if the axe be sharp and true<br/>Since he set its edge anew:<br/>While the crowd in a speechless circle gather<br/>To see the Son fall by the doom of the Father!<br/><br/>It is a lovely hour as yet<br/>Before the summer sun shall set,<br/>Which rose upon that heavy day,<br/>And mock'd it with his steadiest ray;<br/>And his evening beams are shed<br/>Full on Hugo's fated head,<br/>As his last confession pouring<br/>To the monk, his doom deploring<br/>In penitential holiness,<br/>He bends to hear his accents bless<br/>With absolution such as may<br/>Wipe our mortal stains away.<br/>That high sun on his head did glisten<br/>As he there did bow and listen,<br/>And the rings of chestnut hair<br/>Curled half down his neck so bare;<br/>But brighter still the beam was thrown<br/>Upon the axe which near him shone<br/>With a clear and ghastly glitter----<br/>Oh! that parting hour was bitter!<br/>Even the stern stood chilled with awe:<br/>Dark the crime, and just the law--<br/>Yet they shuddered as they saw.<br/><br/>The parting prayers are said and over<br/>Of that false son, and daring lover!<br/>His beads and sins are all recounted,<br/>His hours to their last minute mounted;<br/>His mantling cloak before was stripped,<br/>His bright brown locks must now be clipped;<br/>'Tis done--all closely are they shorn;<br/>The vest which till this moment worn--<br/>The scarf which Parisina gave--<br/>Must not adorn him to the grave.<br/>Even that must now be thrown aside,<br/>And o'er his eyes the kerchief tied;<br/>But no--that last indignity<br/>Shall ne'er approach his haughty eye.<br/>All feelings seemingly subdued,<br/>In deep disdain were half renewed,<br/>When headsman's hands prepared to bind<br/>Those eyes which would not brook such blind,<br/>As if they dared not look on death.<br/>"No--yours my forfeit blood and breath;<br/>These hands are chained, but let me die<br/>At least with an unshackled eye--<br/>Strike:"--and as the word he said,<br/>Upon the block he bowed his head;<br/>These the last accents Hugo spoke:<br/>"Strike"--and flashing fell the stroke--<br/>Rolled the head--and, gushing, sunk<br/>Back the stained and heaving trunk,<br/>In the dust, which each deep vein<br/>Slaked with its ensanguined rain;<br/>His eyes and lips a moment quiver,<br/>Convulsed and quick--then fix for ever.<br/><br/>He died, as erring man should die,<br/>  Without display, without parade;<br/>  Meekly had he bowed and prayed,<br/>  As not disdaining priestly aid,<br/>Nor desperate of all hope on high.<br/>And while before the Prior kneeling,<br/>His heart was weaned from earthly feeling;<br/>His wrathful Sire--his Paramour--<br/>What were they in such an hour?<br/>No more reproach,--no more despair,--<br/>No thought but Heaven,--no word but prayer--<br/>Save the few which from him broke,<br/>When, bared to meet the headsman's stroke,<br/>He claimed to die with eyes unbound,<br/>His sole adieu to those around.<br/><br/>Still as the lips that closed in death,<br/>Each gazer's bosom held his breath:<br/>But yet, afar, from man to man,<br/>A cold electric shiver ran,<br/>As down the deadly blow descended<br/>On him whose life and love thus ended;<br/>And, with a hushing sound compressed,<br/>A sigh shrunk back on every breast;<br/>But no more thrilling noise rose there,<br/>  Beyond the blow that to the block<br/>  Pierced through with forced and sullen shock,<br/>Save one:--what cleaves the silent air<br/>So madly shrill, so passing wild?<br/>That, as a mother's o'er her child,<br/>Done to death by sudden blow,<br/>To the sky these accents go,<br/>Like a soul's in endless woe.<br/>Through Azo's palace-lattice driven,<br/>That horrid voice ascends to heaven,<br/>And every eye is turned thereon;<br/>But sound and sight alike are gone!<br/>It was a woman's shriek--and ne'er<br/>In madlier accents rose despair;<br/>And those who heard it, as it past,<br/>In mercy wished it were the last.<br/><br/>Hugo is fallen; and, from that hour,<br/>No more in palace, hall, or bower,<br/>Was Parisina heard or seen:<br/>Her name--as if she ne'er had been--<br/>Was banished from each lip and ear,<br/>Like words of wantonness or fear;<br/>And from Prince Azo's voice, by none<br/>Was mention heard of wife or son;<br/>No tomb--no memory had they;<br/>Theirs was unconsecrated clay--<br/>At least the Knight's who died that day.<br/>But Parisina's fate lies hid<br/>Like dust beneath the coffin lid:<br/>Whether in convent she abode,<br/>And won to heaven her dreary road,<br/>By blighted and remorseful years<br/>Of scourge, and fast, and sleepless tears;<br/>Or if she fell by bowl or steel,<br/>For that dark love she dared to feel:<br/>Or if, upon the moment smote,<br/>She died by tortures less remote,<br/>Like him she saw upon the block<br/>With heart that shared the headsman's shock,<br/>In quickened brokenness that came,<br/>In pity o'er her shattered frame,<br/>None knew--and none can ever know:<br/>But whatsoe'er its end below,<br/>Her life began and closed in woe!<br/><br/>And Azo found another bride,<br/>And goodly sons grew by his side;<br/>But none so lovely and so brave<br/>As him who withered in the grave;<br/>Or if they were--on his cold eye<br/>Their growth but glanced unheeded by,<br/>Or noticed with a smothered sigh.<br/>But never tear his cheek descended,<br/>And never smile his brow unbended;<br/>And o'er that fair broad brow were wrought<br/>The intersected lines of thought;<br/>Those furrows which the burning share<br/>Of Sorrow ploughs untimely there;<br/>Scars of the lacerating mind<br/>Which the Soul's war doth leave behind.<br/>He was past all mirth or woe:<br/>Nothing more remained below<br/>But sleepless nights and heavy days,<br/>A mind all dead to scorn or praise,<br/>A heart which shunned itself--and yet<br/>That would not yield, nor could forget,<br/>Which, when it least appeared to melt,<br/>Intensely thought--intensely felt:<br/>The deepest ice which ever froze<br/>Can only o'er the surface close;<br/>The living stream lies quick below,<br/>And flows, and cannot cease to flow.<br/>Still was his sealed-up bosom haunted<br/>By thoughts which Nature hath implanted;<br/>Too deeply rooted thence to vanish,<br/>Howe'er our stifled tears we banish;<br/>When struggling as they rise to start,<br/>We check those waters of the heart,<br/>They are not dried--those tears unshed<br/>But flow back to the fountain head,<br/>And resting in their spring more pure,<br/>For ever in its depth endure,<br/>Unseen--unwept--but uncongealed,<br/>And cherished most where least revealed.<br/>With inward starts of feeling left,<br/>To throb o'er those of life bereft,<br/>Without the power to fill again<br/>The desert gap which made his pain;<br/>Without the hope to meet them where<br/>United souls shall gladness share;<br/>With all the consciousness that he<br/>Had only passed a just decree;<br/>That they had wrought their doom of ill;<br/>Yet Azo's age was wretched still.<br/>The tainted branches of the tree,<br/>  If lopped with care, a strength may give,<br/>  By which the rest shall bloom and live<br/>All greenly fresh and wildly free:<br/>But if the lightning, in its wrath,<br/>The waving boughs with fury scathe,<br/>The massy trunk the ruin feels,<br/>And never more a leaf reveals.
