<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ The Witch of Atlas by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    TO MARY<br/><br/>(ON HER OBJECTING TO THE FOLLOWING POEM, UPON THE<br/>SCORE OF ITS CONTAINING NO HUMAN INTEREST).<br/><br/>How, my dear Mary,--are you critic-bitten<br/>(For vipers kill, though dead) by some review,<br/>That you condemn these verses I have written,<br/>Because they tell no story, false or true?<br/>What, though no mice are caught by a young kitten,<br/>May it not leap and play as grown cats do,<br/>Till its claws come? Prithee, for this one time,<br/>Content thee with a visionary rhyme.<br/><br/>What hand would crush the silken-winged fly,<br/>The youngest of inconstant April's minions,<br/>Because it cannot climb the purest sky,<br/>Where the swan sings, amid the sun's dominions?<br/>Not thine. Thou knowest 'tis its doom to die,<br/>When Day shall hide within her twilight pinions<br/>The lucent eyes, and the eternal smile,<br/>Serene as thine, which lent it life awhile.<br/><br/>To thy fair feet a winged Vision came,<br/>Whose date should have been longer than a day,<br/>And o'er thy head did beat its wings for fame,<br/>And in thy sight its fading plumes display;<br/>The watery bow burned in the evening flame.<br/>But the shower fell, the swift Sun went his way--<br/>And that is dead.--O, let me not believe<br/>That anything of mine is fit to live!<br/><br/>Wordsworth informs us he was nineteen years<br/>Considering and retouching Peter Bell;<br/>Watering his laurels with the killing tears<br/>Of slow, dull care, so that their roots to Hell<br/>Might pierce, and their wide branches blot the spheres<br/>Of Heaven, with dewy leaves and flowers; this well<br/>May be, for Heaven and Earth conspire to foil<br/>The over-busy gardener's blundering toil.<br/><br/>My Witch indeed is not so sweet a creature<br/>As Ruth or Lucy, whom his graceful praise<br/>Clothes for our grandsons--but she matches Peter,<br/>Though he took nineteen years, and she three days<br/>In dressing. Light the vest of flowing metre<br/>She wears; he, proud as dandy with his stays,<br/>Has hung upon his wiry limbs a dress<br/>Like King Lear's 'looped and windowed raggedness.'<br/><br/>If you strip Peter, you will see a fellow<br/>Scorched by Hell's hyperequatorial climate<br/>Into a kind of a sulphureous yellow:<br/>A lean mark, hardly fit to fling a rhyme at;<br/>In shape a Scaramouch, in hue Othello.<br/>If you unveil my Witch, no priest nor primate<br/>Can shrive you of that sin,--if sin there be<br/>In love, when it becomes idolatry.<br/><br/>THE WITCH OF ATLAS.<br/><br/>Before those cruel Twins, whom at one birth<br/>Incestuous Change bore to her father Time,<br/>Error and Truth, had hunted from the Earth<br/>All those bright natures which adorned its prime,<br/>And left us nothing to believe in, worth<br/>The pains of putting into learned rhyme,<br/>A lady-witch there lived on Atlas' mountain<br/>Within a cavern, by a secret fountain.<br/><br/>Her mother was one of the Atlantides:<br/>The all-beholding Sun had ne'er beholden<br/>In his wide voyage o'er continents and seas<br/>So fair a creature, as she lay enfolden<br/>In the warm shadow of her loveliness;--<br/>He kissed her with his beams, and made all golden<br/>The chamber of gray rock in which she lay--<br/>She, in that dream of joy, dissolved away.<br/><br/>'Tis said, she first was changed into a vapour,<br/>And then into a cloud, such clouds as flit,<br/>Like splendour-winged moths about a taper,<br/>Round the red west when the sun dies in it:<br/>And then into a meteor, such as caper<br/>On hill-tops when the moon is in a fit:<br/>Then, into one of those mysterious stars<br/>Which hide themselves between the Earth and Mars.<br/><br/>Ten times the Mother of the Months had bent<br/>Her bow beside the folding-star, and bidden<br/>With that bright sign the billows to indent<br/>The sea-deserted sand--like children chidden,<br/>At her command they ever came and went--<br/>Since in that cave a dewy splendour hidden<br/>Took shape and motion: with the living form<br/>Of this embodied Power, the cave grew warm.<br/><br/>A lovely lady garmented in light<br/>From her own beauty--deep her eyes, as are<br/>Two openings of unfathomable night<br/>Seen through a Temple's cloven roof--her hair<br/>Dark--the dim brain whirls dizzy with delight.<br/>Picturing her form; her soft smiles shone afar,<br/>And her low voice was heard like love, and drew<br/>All living things towards this wonder new.<br/><br/>And first the spotted cameleopard came,<br/>And then the wise and fearless elephant;<br/>Then the sly serpent, in the golden flame<br/>Of his own volumes intervolved;--all gaunt<br/>And sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame.<br/>They drank before her at her sacred fount;<br/>And every beast of beating heart grew bold,<br/>Such gentleness and power even to behold.<br/><br/>The brinded lioness led forth her young,<br/>That she might teach them how they should forego<br/>Their inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung<br/>His sinews at her feet, and sought to know<br/>With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue<br/>How he might be as gentle as the doe.<br/>The magic circle of her voice and eyes<br/>All savage natures did imparadise.<br/><br/>And old Silenus, shaking a green stick<br/>Of lilies, and the wood-gods in a crew<br/>Came, blithe, as in the olive copses thick<br/>Cicadae are, drunk with the noonday dew:<br/>And Dryope and Faunus followed quick,<br/>Teasing the God to sing them something new;<br/>Till in this cave they found the lady lone,<br/>Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.<br/><br/>And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,<br/>And though none saw him,--through the adamant<br/>Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,<br/>And through those living spirits, like a want,<br/>He passed out of his everlasting lair<br/>Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,<br/>And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--<br/>And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.<br/><br/>And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,<br/>And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,<br/>Who drives her white waves over the green sea,<br/>And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,<br/>And quaint Priapus with his company,<br/>All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks<br/>Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--<br/>Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.<br/><br/>The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,<br/>And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--<br/>Their spirits shook within them, as a flame<br/>Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:<br/>Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,<br/>Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt<br/>Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,<br/>Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.<br/><br/>For she was beautiful--her beauty made<br/>The bright world dim, and everything beside<br/>Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:<br/>No thought of living spirit could abide,<br/>Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,<br/>On any object in the world so wide,<br/>On any hope within the circling skies,<br/>But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.<br/><br/>Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle<br/>And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three<br/>Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle<br/>The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she<br/>As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle<br/>In the belated moon, wound skilfully;<br/>And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--<br/>A shadow for the splendour of her love.<br/><br/>The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling<br/>Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,<br/>Which had the power all spirits of compelling,<br/>Folded in cells of crystal silence there;<br/>Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling<br/>Will never die--yet ere we are aware,<br/>The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,<br/>And the regret they leave remains alone.<br/><br/>And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,<br/>Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,<br/>Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint<br/>With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.<br/>It was its work to bear to many a saint<br/>Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,<br/>Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,<br/>And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.<br/><br/>And odours in a kind of aviary<br/>Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,<br/>Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy<br/>Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;<br/>As bats at the wired window of a dairy,<br/>They beat their vans; and each was an adept,<br/>When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,<br/>To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.<br/><br/>And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might<br/>Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,<br/>And change eternal death into a night<br/>Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,<br/>Could make their tears all wonder and delight,<br/>She in her crystal vials did closely keep:<br/>If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said<br/>The living were not envied of the dead.<br/><br/>Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,<br/>The works of some Saturnian Archimage,<br/>Which taught the expiations at whose price<br/>Men from the Gods might win that happy age<br/>Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;<br/>And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage<br/>Of gold and blood--till men should live and move<br/>Harmonious as the sacred stars above;<br/><br/>And how all things that seem untameable,<br/>Not to be checked and not to be confined,<br/>Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;<br/>Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,<br/>And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;<br/>And other scrolls whose writings did unbind<br/>The inmost lore of Love--let the profane<br/>Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.<br/><br/>And wondrous works of substances unknown,<br/>To which the enchantment of her father's power<br/>Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,<br/>Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;<br/>Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone<br/>In their own golden beams--each like a flower,<br/>Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light<br/>Under a cypress in a starless night.<br/><br/>At first she lived alone in this wild home,<br/>And her own thoughts were each a minister,<br/>Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,<br/>Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,<br/>To work whatever purposes might come<br/>Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire<br/>Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,<br/>Through all the regions which he shines upon.<br/><br/>The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,<br/>Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,<br/>Offered to do her bidding through the seas,<br/>Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,<br/>And far beneath the matted roots of trees,<br/>And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,<br/>So they might live for ever in the light<br/>Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.<br/><br/>'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;<br/>'The fountains where the Naiades bedew<br/>Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;<br/>The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew<br/>Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;<br/>The boundless ocean like a drop of dew<br/>Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must<br/>Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.<br/><br/>'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--<br/>If I must sigh to think that this shall be,<br/>If I must weep when the surviving Sun<br/>Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me<br/>To love you till your little race is run;<br/>I cannot die as ye must--over me<br/>Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell<br/>Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--<br/><br/>She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well<br/>Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,<br/>And every little circlet where they fell<br/>Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres<br/>And intertangled lines of light:--a knell<br/>Of sobbing voices came upon her ears<br/>From those departing Forms, o'er the serene<br/>Of the white streams and of the forest green.<br/><br/>All day the wizard lady sate aloof,<br/>Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,<br/>Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;<br/>Or broidering the pictured poesy<br/>Of some high tale upon her growing woof,<br/>Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye<br/>In hues outshining heaven--and ever she<br/>Added some grace to the wrought poesy.<br/><br/>While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece<br/>Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;<br/>Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--<br/>Each flame of it is as a precious stone<br/>Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this<br/>Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.<br/>The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand<br/>She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.<br/><br/>This lady never slept, but lay in trance<br/>All night within the fountain--as in sleep.<br/>Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;<br/>Through the green splendour of the water deep<br/>She saw the constellations reel and dance<br/>Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep<br/>The tenour of her contemplations calm,<br/>With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.<br/><br/>And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended<br/>From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,<br/>She passed at dewfall to a space extended,<br/>Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel<br/>Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,<br/>There yawned an inextinguishable well<br/>Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,<br/>And overflowing all the margin trim.<br/><br/>Within the which she lay when the fierce war<br/>Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor<br/>In many a mimic moon and bearded star<br/>O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker<br/>In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--<br/>And when the windless snow descended thicker<br/>Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came<br/>Melt on the surface of the level flame.<br/><br/>She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought<br/>For Venus, as the chariot of her star;<br/>But it was found too feeble to be fraught<br/>With all the ardours in that sphere which are,<br/>And so she sold it, and Apollo bought<br/>And gave it to this daughter: from a car<br/>Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat<br/>Which ever upon mortal stream did float.<br/><br/>And others say, that, when but three hours old,<br/>The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,<br/>And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,<br/>And like a horticultural adept,<br/>Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,<br/>And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept<br/>Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,<br/>And with his wings fanning it as it grew.<br/><br/>The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower<br/>Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began<br/>To turn the light and dew by inward power<br/>To its own substance; woven tracery ran<br/>Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er<br/>The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--<br/>Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion<br/>Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.<br/><br/>This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit<br/>A living spirit within all its frame,<br/>Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.<br/>Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,<br/>One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--<br/>Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--<br/>Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--<br/>In joyous expectation lay the boat.<br/><br/>Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow<br/>Together, tempering the repugnant mass<br/>With liquid love--all things together grow<br/>Through which the harmony of love can pass;<br/>And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--<br/>A living Image, which did far surpass<br/>In beauty that bright shape of vital stone<br/>Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.<br/><br/>A sexless thing it was, and in its growth<br/>It seemed to have developed no defect<br/>Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--<br/>In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;<br/>The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,<br/>The countenance was such as might select<br/>Some artist that his skill should never die,<br/>Imaging forth such perfect purity.<br/><br/>From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,<br/>Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,<br/>Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,<br/>Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:<br/>She led her creature to the boiling springs<br/>Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'<br/>And pointed to the prow, and took her seat<br/>Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.<br/><br/>And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,<br/>Around their inland islets, and amid<br/>The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast<br/>Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid<br/>In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;<br/>By many a star-surrounded pyramid<br/>Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,<br/>And caverns yawning round unfathomably.<br/><br/>The silver noon into that winding dell,<br/>With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,<br/>Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;<br/>A green and glowing light, like that which drops<br/>From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,<br/>When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;<br/>Between the severed mountains lay on high,<br/>Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.<br/><br/>And ever as she went, the Image lay<br/>With folded wings and unawakened eyes;<br/>And o'er its gentle countenance did play<br/>The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,<br/>Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,<br/>And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs<br/>Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,<br/>They had aroused from that full heart and brain.<br/><br/>And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud<br/>Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:<br/>Now lingering on the pools, in which abode<br/>The calm and darkness of the deep content<br/>In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road<br/>Of white and dancing waters, all besprent<br/>With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat<br/>In such a shallow rapid could not float.<br/><br/>And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver<br/>Their snow-like waters into golden air,<br/>Or under chasms unfathomable ever<br/>Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear<br/>A subterranean portal for the river,<br/>It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear<br/>Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,<br/>Lighting it far upon its lampless way.<br/><br/>And when the wizard lady would ascend<br/>The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,<br/>Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--<br/>She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale<br/>And heavy hue which slumber could extend<br/>Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale<br/>A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,<br/>Into the darkness of the stream did pass.<br/><br/>And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,<br/>With stars of fire spotting the stream below;<br/>And from above into the Sun's dominions<br/>Flinging a glory, like the golden glow<br/>In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,<br/>All interwoven with fine feathery snow<br/>And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,<br/>With which frost paints the pines in winter time.<br/><br/>And then it winnowed the Elysian air<br/>Which ever hung about that lady bright,<br/>With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,<br/>Like a star up the torrent of the night,<br/>Or a swift eagle in the morning glare<br/>Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,<br/>The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,<br/>Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.<br/><br/>The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow<br/>Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;<br/>The still air seemed as if its waves did flow<br/>In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven<br/>The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:<br/>Beneath, the billows having vainly striven<br/>Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel<br/>The swift and steady motion of the keel.<br/><br/>Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,<br/>Or in the noon of interlunar night,<br/>The lady-witch in visions could not chain<br/>Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light<br/>Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain<br/>Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;<br/>She to the Austral waters took her way,<br/>Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--<br/><br/>Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,<br/>Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,<br/>With the Antarctic constellations paven,<br/>Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--<br/>There she would build herself a windless haven<br/>Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make<br/>The bastions of the storm, when through the sky<br/>The spirits of the tempest thundered by:<br/><br/>A haven beneath whose translucent floor<br/>The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,<br/>And around which the solid vapours hoar,<br/>Based on the level waters, to the sky<br/>Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore<br/>Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly<br/>Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,<br/>And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.<br/><br/>And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash<br/>Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,<br/>And the incessant hail with stony clash<br/>Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing<br/>Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash<br/>Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering<br/>Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven<br/>Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--<br/><br/>On which that lady played her many pranks,<br/>Circling the image of a shooting star,<br/>Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks<br/>Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,<br/>In her light boat; and many quips and cranks<br/>She played upon the water, till the car<br/>Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,<br/>To journey from the misty east began.<br/><br/>And then she called out of the hollow turrets<br/>Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,<br/>The armies of her ministering spirits--<br/>In mighty legions, million after million,<br/>They came, each troop emblazoning its merits<br/>On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion<br/>Of the intertexture of the atmosphere<br/>They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.<br/><br/>They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen<br/>Of woven exhalations, underlaid<br/>With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen<br/>A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid<br/>With crimson silk--cressets from the serene<br/>Hung there, and on the water for her tread<br/>A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,<br/>Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.<br/><br/>And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught<br/>Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,<br/>Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,<br/>She sate, and heard all that had happened new<br/>Between the earth and moon, since they had brought<br/>The last intelligence--and now she grew<br/>Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--<br/>And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.<br/><br/>These were tame pleasures; she would often climb<br/>The steepest ladder of the crudded rack<br/>Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,<br/>And like Arion on the dolphin's back<br/>Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time<br/>Following the serpent lightning's winding track,<br/>She ran upon the platforms of the wind,<br/>And laughed to bear the fire-balls roar behind.<br/><br/>And sometimes to those streams of upper air<br/>Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,<br/>She would ascend, and win the spirits there<br/>To let her join their chorus. Mortals found<br/>That on those days the sky was calm and fair,<br/>And mystic snatches of harmonious sound<br/>Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,<br/>And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.<br/><br/>But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,<br/>To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads<br/>Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep<br/>Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,<br/>Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,<br/>His waters on the plain: and crested heads<br/>Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,<br/>And many a vapour-belted pyramid.<br/><br/>By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,<br/>Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,<br/>Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,<br/>Or charioteering ghastly alligators,<br/>Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes<br/>Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors<br/>Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,<br/>Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.<br/><br/>And where within the surface of the river<br/>The shadows of the massy temples lie,<br/>And never are erased--but tremble ever<br/>Like things which every cloud can doom to die,<br/>Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever<br/>The works of man pierced that serenest sky<br/>With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight<br/>To wander in the shadow of the night.<br/><br/>With motion like the spirit of that wind<br/>Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet<br/>Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.<br/>Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,<br/>Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined<br/>With many a dark and subterranean street<br/>Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep<br/>She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.<br/><br/>A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see<br/>Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.<br/>Here lay two sister twins in infancy;<br/>There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;<br/>Within, two lovers linked innocently<br/>In their loose locks which over both did creep<br/>Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm<br/>Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.<br/><br/>But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,<br/>Not to be mirrored in a holy song--<br/>Distortions foul of supernatural awe,<br/>And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;<br/>And all the code of Custom's lawless law<br/>Written upon the brows of old and young:<br/>'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife<br/>Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'<br/><br/>And little did the sight disturb her soul.--<br/>We, the weak mariners of that wide lake<br/>Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,<br/>Our course unpiloted and starless make<br/>O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--<br/>But she in the calm depths her way could take,<br/>Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide<br/>Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.<br/><br/>And she saw princes couched under the glow<br/>Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court<br/>In dormitories ranged, row after row,<br/>She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--<br/>For all were educated to be so.--<br/>The peasants in their huts, and in the port<br/>The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,<br/>And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.<br/><br/>And all the forms in which those spirits lay<br/>Were to her sight like the diaphanous<br/>Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array<br/>Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us<br/>Only their scorn of all concealment: they<br/>Move in the light of their own beauty thus.<br/>But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,<br/>And little thought a Witch was looking on them.<br/><br/>She, all those human figures breathing there,<br/>Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes<br/>The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,<br/>And often through a rude and worn disguise<br/>She saw the inner form most bright and fair--<br/>And then she had a charm of strange device,<br/>Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,<br/>Could make that spirit mingle with her own.<br/><br/>Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given<br/>For such a charm when Tithon became gray?<br/>Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven<br/>Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina<br/>Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven<br/>Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,<br/>To any witch who would have taught you it?<br/>The Heliad doth not know its value yet.<br/><br/>'Tis said in after times her spirit free<br/>Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--<br/>But holy Dian could not chaster be<br/>Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,<br/>Than now this lady--like a sexless bee<br/>Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,<br/>Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden<br/>Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.<br/><br/>To those she saw most beautiful, she gave<br/>Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--<br/>They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,<br/>And lived thenceforward as if some control,<br/>Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave<br/>Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,<br/>Was as a green and overarching bower<br/>Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.<br/><br/>For on the night when they were buried, she<br/>Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook<br/>The light out of the funeral lamps, to be<br/>A mimic day within that deathy nook;<br/>And she unwound the woven imagery<br/>Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took<br/>The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,<br/>And threw it with contempt into a ditch.<br/><br/>And there the body lay, age after age.<br/>Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,<br/>Like one asleep in a green hermitage,<br/>With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,<br/>And living in its dreams beyond the rage<br/>Of death or life; while they were still arraying<br/>In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind<br/>And fleeting generations of mankind.<br/><br/>And she would write strange dreams upon the brain<br/>Of those who were less beautiful, and make<br/>All harsh and crooked purposes more vain<br/>Than in the desert is the serpent's wake<br/>Which the sand covers--all his evil gain<br/>The miser in such dreams would rise and shake<br/>Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe<br/>Would his own lies betray without a bribe.<br/><br/>The priests would write an explanation full,<br/>Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,<br/>How the God Apis really was a bull,<br/>And nothing more; and bid the herald stick<br/>The same against the temple doors, and pull<br/>The old cant down; they licensed all to speak<br/>Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,<br/>By pastoral letters to each diocese.<br/><br/>The king would dress an ape up in his crown<br/>And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,<br/>And on the right hand of the sunlike throne<br/>Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat<br/>The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one<br/>Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet<br/>Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,<br/>And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!<br/><br/>The soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths, and<br/>Walked out of quarters in somnambulism;<br/>Round the red anvils you might see them stand<br/>Like Cyclopses in Vulcan's sooty abysm,<br/>Beating their swords to ploughshares;--in a band<br/>The gaolers sent those of the liberal schism<br/>Free through the streets of Memphis, much, I wis,<br/>To the annoyance of king Amasis.<br/><br/>And timid lovers who had been so coy,<br/>They hardly knew whether they loved or not,<br/>Would rise out of their rest, and take sweet joy,<br/>To the fulfilment of their inmost thought;<br/>And when next day the maiden and the boy<br/>Met one another, both, like sinners caught,<br/>Blushed at the thing which each believed was done<br/>Only in fancy--till the tenth moon shone;<br/><br/>And then the Witch would let them take no ill:<br/>Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,<br/>The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill<br/>Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.<br/>Friends who, by practice of some envious skill,<br/>Were torn apart--a wide wound, mind from mind!--<br/>She did unite again with visions clear<br/>Of deep affection and of truth sincere.<br/><br/>These were the pranks she played among the cities<br/>Of mortal men, and what she did to Sprites<br/>And Gods, entangling them in her sweet ditties<br/>To do her will, and show their subtle sleights,<br/>I will declare another time; for it is<br/>A tale more fit for the weird winter nights<br/>Than for these garish summer days, when we<br/>Scarcely believe much more than we can see.
