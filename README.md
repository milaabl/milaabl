<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Epipsychidion by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    VERSES ADDRESSED TO THE NOBLE AND UNFORTUNATE LADY, EMILIA V--,<br/><br/>NOW IMPRISONED IN THE CONVENT OF --.<br/><br/>L'anima amante si slancia fuori del creato, e si crea nell' infinito un<br/>Mondo tutto per essa, diverso assai da questo oscuro e pauroso baratro.<br/>HER OWN WORDS.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>My Song, I fear that thou wilt find but few<br/>Who fitly shalt conceive thy reasoning,<br/>Of such hard matter dost thou entertain;<br/>Whence, if by misadventure, chance should bring<br/>Thee to base company (as chance may do),<br/>Quite unaware of what thou dost contain,<br/>I prithee, comfort thy sweet self again,<br/>My last delight! tell them that they are dull,<br/>And bid them own that thou art beautiful.<br/><br/>EPIPSYCHIDION.<br/><br/>Sweet Spirit! Sister of that orphan one,<br/>Whose empire is the name thou weepest on,<br/>In my heart's temple I suspend to thee<br/>These votive wreaths of withered memory.<br/><br/>Poor captive bird! who, from thy narrow cage,<br/>Pourest such music, that it might assuage<br/>The rugged hearts of those who prisoned thee,<br/>Were they not deaf to all sweet melody;<br/>This song shall be thy rose: its petals pale<br/>Are dead, indeed, my adored Nightingale!<br/>But soft and fragrant is the faded blossom,<br/>And it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom.<br/><br/>High, spirit-winged Heart! who dost for ever<br/>Beat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour,<br/>Till those bright plumes of thought, in which arrayed<br/>It over-soared this low and worldly shade,<br/>Lie shattered; and thy panting, wounded breast<br/>Stains with dear blood its unmaternal nest!<br/>I weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be,<br/>Yet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee.<br/><br/>Seraph of Heaven! too gentle to be human,<br/>Veiling beneath that radiant form of Woman<br/>All that is insupportable in thee<br/>Of light, and love, and immortality!<br/>Sweet Benediction in the eternal Curse!<br/>Veiled Glory of this lampless Universe!<br/>Thou Moon beyond the clouds! Thou living Form<br/>Among the Dead! Thou Star above the Storm!<br/>Thou Wonder, and thou Beauty, and thou Terror!<br/>Thou Harmony of Nature's art! Thou Mirror<br/>In whom, as in the splendour of the Sun,<br/>All shapes look glorious which thou gazest on!<br/>Ay, even the dim words which obscure thee now<br/>Flash, lightning-like, with unaccustomed glow;<br/>I pray thee that thou blot from this sad song<br/>All of its much mortality and wrong,<br/>With those clear drops, which start like sacred dew<br/>From the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through,<br/>Weeping, till sorrow becomes ecstasy:<br/>Then smile on it, so that it may not die.<br/><br/>I never thought before my death to see<br/>Youth's vision thus made perfect. Emily,<br/>I love thee; though the world by no thin name<br/>Will hide that love from its unvalued shame.<br/>Would we two had been twins of the same mother!<br/>Or, that the name my heart lent to another<br/>Could be a sister's bond for her and thee,<br/>Blending two beams of one eternity!<br/>Yet were one lawful and the other true,<br/>These names, though dear, could paint not, as is due.<br/>How beyond refuge I am thine. Ah me!<br/>I am not thine: I am a part of THEE.<br/><br/>Sweet Lamp! my moth-like Muse has burned its wings<br/>Or, like a dying swan who soars and sings,<br/>Young Love should teach Time, in his own gray style,<br/>All that thou art. Art thou not void of guile,<br/>A lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless?<br/>A well of sealed and secret happiness,<br/>Whose waters like blithe light and music are,<br/>Vanquishing dissonance and gloom? A Star<br/>Which moves not in the moving heavens, alone?<br/>A Smile amid dark frowns? a gentle tone<br/>Amid rude voices? a beloved light?<br/>A Solitude, a Refuge, a Delight?<br/>A Lute, which those whom Love has taught to play<br/>Make music on, to soothe the roughest day<br/>And lull fond Grief asleep? a buried treasure?<br/>A cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure?<br/>A violet-shrouded grave of Woe?--I measure<br/>The world of fancies, seeking one like thee,<br/>And find--alas! mine own infirmity.<br/><br/>She met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way,<br/>And lured me towards sweet Death; as Night by Day,<br/>Winter by Spring, or Sorrow by swift Hope,<br/>Led into light, life, peace. An antelope,<br/>In the suspended impulse of its lightness,<br/>Were less aethereally light: the brightness<br/>Of her divinest presence trembles through<br/>Her limbs, as underneath a cloud of dew<br/>Embodied in the windless heaven of June<br/>Amid the splendour-winged stars, the Moon<br/>Burns, inextinguishably beautiful:<br/>And from her lips, as from a hyacinth full<br/>Of honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops,<br/>Killing the sense with passion; sweet as stops<br/>Of planetary music heard in trance.<br/>In her mild lights the starry spirits dance,<br/>The sunbeams of those wells which ever leap<br/>Under the lightnings of the soul--too deep<br/>For the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.<br/>The glory of her being, issuing thence,<br/>Stains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade<br/>Of unentangled intermixture, made<br/>By Love, of light and motion: one intense<br/>Diffusion, one serene Omnipresence,<br/>Whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing,<br/>Around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing<br/>With the unintermitted blood, which there<br/>Quivers, (as in a fleece of snow-like air<br/>The crimson pulse of living morning quiver,)<br/>Continuously prolonged, and ending never,<br/>Till they are lost, and in that Beauty furled<br/>Which penetrates and clasps and fills the world;<br/>Scarce visible from extreme loveliness.<br/>Warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress<br/>And her loose hair; and where some heavy tress<br/>The air of her own speed has disentwined,<br/>The sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind;<br/>And in the soul a wild odour is felt<br/>Beyond the sense, like fiery dews that melt<br/>Into the bosom of a frozen bud.--<br/>See where she stands! a mortal shape indued<br/>With love and life and light and deity,<br/>And motion which may change but cannot die;<br/>An image of some bright Eternity;<br/>A shadow of some golden dream; a Splendour<br/>Leaving the third sphere pilotless; a tender<br/>Reflection of the eternal Moon of Love<br/>Under whose motions life's dull billows move;<br/>A Metaphor of Spring and Youth and Morning;<br/>A Vision like incarnate April, warning,<br/>With smiles and tears, Frost the Anatomy<br/>Into his summer grave.<br/>Ah, woe is me!<br/>What have I dared? where am I lifted? how<br/>Shall I descend, and perish not? I know<br/>That Love makes all things equal: I have heard<br/>By mine own heart this joyous truth averred:<br/>The spirit of the worm beneath the sod<br/>In love and worship, blends itself with God.<br/><br/>Spouse! Sister! Angel! Pilot of the Fate<br/>Whose course has been so starless! O too late<br/>Beloved! O too soon adored, by me!<br/>For in the fields of Immortality<br/>My spirit should at first have worshipped thine,<br/>A divine presence in a place divine;<br/>Or should have moved beside it on this earth,<br/>A shadow of that substance, from its birth;<br/>But not as now:--I love thee; yes, I feel<br/>That on the fountain of my heart a seal<br/>Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright<br/>For thee, since in those TEARS thou hast delight.<br/>We--are we not formed, as notes of music are,<br/>For one another, though dissimilar;<br/>Such difference without discord, as can make<br/>Those sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake<br/>As trembling leaves in a continuous air?<br/><br/>Thy wisdom speaks in me, and bids me dare<br/>Beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.<br/>I never was attached to that great sect,<br/>Whose doctrine is, that each one should select<br/>Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend,<br/>And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend<br/>To cold oblivion, though it is in the code<br/>Of modern morals, and the beaten road<br/>Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread,<br/>Who travel to their home among the dead<br/>By the broad highway of the world, and so<br/>With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,<br/>The dreariest and the longest journey go.<br/><br/>True Love in this differs from gold and clay,<br/>That to divide is not to take away.<br/>Love is like understanding, that grows bright,<br/>Gazing on many truths; 'tis like thy light,<br/>Imagination! which from earth and sky,<br/>And from the depths of human fantasy,<br/>As from a thousand prisms and mirrors, fills<br/>The Universe with glorious beams, and kills<br/>Error, the worm, with many a sun-like arrow<br/>Of its reverberated lightning. Narrow<br/>The heart that loves, the brain that contemplates,<br/>The life that wears, the spirit that creates<br/>One object, and one form, and builds thereby<br/>A sepulchre for its eternity.<br/><br/>Mind from its object differs most in this:<br/>Evil from good; misery from happiness;<br/>The baser from the nobler; the impure<br/>And frail, from what is clear and must endure.<br/>If you divide suffering and dross, you may<br/>Diminish till it is consumed away;<br/>If you divide pleasure and love and thought,<br/>Each part exceeds the whole; and we know not<br/>How much, while any yet remains unshared,<br/>Of pleasure may be gained, of sorrow spared:<br/>This truth is that deep well, whence sages draw<br/>The unenvied light of hope; the eternal law<br/>By which those live, to whom this world of life<br/>Is as a garden ravaged, and whose strife<br/>Tills for the promise of a later birth<br/>The wilderness of this Elysian earth.<br/><br/>There was a Being whom my spirit oft<br/>Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,<br/>In the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn,<br/>Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,<br/>Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves<br/>Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves<br/>Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor<br/>Paved her light steps;--on an imagined shore,<br/>Under the gray beak of some promontory<br/>She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,<br/>That I beheld her not. In solitudes<br/>Her voice came to me through the whispering woods,<br/>And from the fountains, and the odours deep<br/>Of flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep<br/>Of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,<br/>Breathed but of HER to the enamoured air;<br/>And from the breezes whether low or loud,<br/>And from the rain of every passing cloud,<br/>And from the singing of the summer-birds,<br/>And from all sounds, all silence. In the words<br/>Of antique verse and high romance,--in form,<br/>Sound, colour--in whatever checks that Storm<br/>Which with the shattered present chokes the past;<br/>And in that best philosophy, whose taste<br/>Makes this cold common hell, our life, a doom<br/>As glorious as a fiery martyrdom;<br/>Her Spirit was the harmony of truth.--<br/><br/>Then, from the caverns of my dreamy youth<br/>I sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,<br/>And towards the lodestar of my one desire,<br/>I flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight<br/>Is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light,<br/>When it would seek in Hesper's setting sphere<br/>A radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,<br/>As if it were a lamp of earthly flame.--<br/>But She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,<br/>Passed, like a God throned on a winged planet,<br/>Whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,<br/>Into the dreary cone of our life's shade;<br/>And as a man with mighty loss dismayed,<br/>I would have followed, though the grave between<br/>Yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen:<br/>When a voice said:--'O thou of hearts the weakest,<br/>The phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.'<br/>Then I--'Where?'--the world's echo answered 'where?'<br/>And in that silence, and in my despair,<br/>I questioned every tongueless wind that flew<br/>Over my tower of mourning, if it knew<br/>Whither 'twas fled, this soul out of my soul;<br/>And murmured names and spells which have control<br/>Over the sightless tyrants of our fate;<br/>But neither prayer nor verse could dissipate<br/>The night which closed on her; nor uncreate<br/>That world within this Chaos, mine and me,<br/>Of which she was the veiled Divinity,<br/>The world I say of thoughts that worshipped her:<br/>And therefore I went forth, with hope and fear<br/>And every gentle passion sick to death,<br/>Feeding my course with expectation's breath,<br/>Into the wintry forest of our life;<br/>And struggling through its error with vain strife,<br/>And stumbling in my weakness and my haste,<br/>And half bewildered by new forms, I passed,<br/>Seeking among those untaught foresters<br/>If I could find one form resembling hers,<br/>In which she might have masked herself from me.<br/>There,--One, whose voice was venomed melody<br/>Sate by a well, under blue nightshade bowers:<br/>The breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,<br/>Her touch was as electric poison,--flame<br/>Out of her looks into my vitals came,<br/>And from her living cheeks and bosom flew<br/>A killing air, which pierced like honey-dew<br/>Into the core of my green heart, and lay<br/>Upon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray<br/>O'er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime<br/>With ruins of unseasonable time.<br/><br/>In many mortal forms I rashly sought<br/>The shadow of that idol of my thought.<br/>And some were fair--but beauty dies away:<br/>Others were wise--but honeyed words betray:<br/>And One was true--oh! why not true to me?<br/>Then, as a hunted deer that could not flee,<br/>I turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,<br/>Wounded and weak and panting; the cold day<br/>Trembled, for pity of my strife and pain.<br/>When, like a noonday dawn, there shone again<br/>Deliverance. One stood on my path who seemed<br/>As like the glorious shape which I had d reamed<br/>As is the Moon, whose changes ever run<br/>Into themselves, to the eternal Sun;<br/>The cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven's bright isles,<br/>Who makes all beautiful on which she smiles,<br/>That wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame<br/>Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,<br/>And warms not but illumines. Young and fair<br/>As the descended Spirit of that sphere,<br/>She hid me, as the Moon may hide the night<br/>From its own darkness, until all was bright<br/>Between the Heaven and Earth of my calm mind,<br/>And, as a cloud charioted by the wind,<br/>She led me to a cave in that wild place,<br/>And sate beside me, with her downward face<br/>Illumining my slumbers, like the Moon<br/>Waxing and waning o'er Endymion.<br/>And I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,<br/>And all my being became bright or dim<br/>As the Moon's image in a summer sea,<br/>According as she smiled or frowned on me;<br/>And there I lay, within a chaste cold bed:<br/>Alas, I then was nor alive nor dead:--<br/>For at her silver voice came Death and Life,<br/>Unmindful each of their accustomed strife,<br/>Masked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,<br/>The wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,<br/>And through the cavern without wings they flew,<br/>And cried 'Away, he is not of our crew.'<br/>I wept, and though it be a dream, I weep.<br/><br/>What storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,<br/>Blotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips<br/>Then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;--<br/>And how my soul was as a lampless sea,<br/>And who was then its Tempest; and when She,<br/>The Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost<br/>Crept o'er those waters, till from coast to coast<br/>The moving billows of my being fell<br/>Into a death of ice, immovable;--<br/>And then--what earthquakes made it gape and split,<br/>The white Moon smiling all the while on it,<br/>These words conceal:--If not, each word would be<br/>The key of staunchless tears. Weep not for me!<br/><br/>At length, into the obscure Forest came<br/>The Vision I had sought through grief and shame.<br/>Athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns<br/>Flashed from her motion splendour like the Morn's,<br/>And from her presence life was radiated<br/>Through the gray earth and branches bare and dead;<br/>So that her way was paved, and roofed above<br/>With flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love;<br/>And music from her respiration spread<br/>Like light,--all other sounds were penetrated<br/>By the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,<br/>So that the savage winds hung mute around;<br/>And odours warm and fresh fell from her hair<br/>Dissolving the dull cold in the frore air:<br/>Soft as an Incarnation of the Sun,<br/>When light is changed to love, this glorious One<br/>Floated into the cavern where I lay,<br/>And called my Spirit, and the dreaming clay<br/>Was lifted by the thing that dreamed below<br/>As smoke by fire, and in her beauty's glow<br/>I stood, and felt the dawn of my long night<br/>Was penetrating me with living light:<br/>I knew it was the Vision veiled from me<br/>So many years--that it was Emily.<br/><br/>Twin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,<br/>This world of loves, this ME; and into birth<br/>Awaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart<br/>Magnetic might into its central heart;<br/>And lift its billows and its mists, and guide<br/>By everlasting laws, each wind and tide<br/>To its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;<br/>And lull its storms, each in the craggy grave<br/>Which was its cradle, luring to faint bowers<br/>The armies of the rainbow-winged showers;<br/>And, as those married lights, which from the towers<br/>Of Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe<br/>In liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;<br/>And all their many-mingled influence blend,<br/>If equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;--<br/>So ye, bright regents, with alternate sway<br/>Govern my sphere of being, night and day!<br/>Thou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;<br/>Thou, not eclipsing a remoter light;<br/>And, through the shadow of the seasons three,<br/>From Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,<br/>Light it into the Winter of the tomb,<br/>Where it may ripen to a brighter bloom.<br/>Thou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,<br/>Who drew the heart of this frail Universe<br/>Towards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,<br/>Alternating attraction and repulsion,<br/>Thine went astray and that was rent in twain;<br/>Oh, float into our azure heaven again!<br/>Be there Love's folding-star at thy return;<br/>The living Sun will feed thee from its urn<br/>Of golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn<br/>In thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn<br/>Will worship thee with incense of calm breath<br/>And lights and shadows; as the star of Death<br/>And Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild<br/>Called Hope and Fear--upon the heart are piled<br/>Their offerings,--of this sacrifice divine<br/>A World shall be the altar.<br/>Lady mine,<br/>Scorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth<br/>Which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth<br/>Whose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,<br/>Will be as of the trees of Paradise.<br/><br/>The day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.<br/>To whatsoe'er of dull mortality<br/>Is mine, remain a vestal sister still;<br/>To the intense, the deep, the imperishable,<br/>Not mine but me, henceforth be thou united<br/>Even as a bride, delighting and delighted.<br/>The hour is come:--the destined Star has risen<br/>Which shall descend upon a vacant prison.<br/>The walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set<br/>The sentinels--but true Love never yet<br/>Was thus constrained: it overleaps all fence:<br/>Like lightning, with invisible violence<br/>Piercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,<br/>Which he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,<br/>Who rides upon a thought, and makes his way<br/>Through temple, tower, and palace, and the array<br/>Of arms: more strength has Love than he or they;<br/>For it can burst his charnel, and make free<br/>The limbs in chains, the heart in agony,<br/>The soul in dust and chaos.<br/>Emily,<br/>A ship is floating in the harbour now,<br/>A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;<br/>There is a path on the sea's azure floor,<br/>No keel has ever ploughed that path before;<br/>The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;<br/>The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;<br/>The merry mariners are bold and free:<br/>Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?<br/>Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest<br/>Is a far Eden of the purple East;<br/>And we between her wings will sit, while Night,<br/>And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,<br/>Our ministers, along the boundless Sea,<br/>Treading each other's heels, unheededly.<br/>It is an isle under Ionian skies,<br/>Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise,<br/>And, for the harbours are not safe and good,<br/>This land would have remained a solitude<br/>But for some pastoral people native there,<br/>Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air<br/>Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,<br/>Simple and spirited; innocent and bold.<br/>The blue Aegean girds this chosen home,<br/>With ever-changing sound and light and foam,<br/>Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;<br/>And all the winds wandering along the shore<br/>Undulate with the undulating tide:<br/>There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;<br/>And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,<br/>As clear as elemental diamond,<br/>Or serene morning air; and far beyond,<br/>The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer<br/>(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)<br/>Pierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls<br/>Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls<br/>Illumining, with sound that never fails<br/>Accompany the noonday nightingales;<br/>And all the place is peopled with sweet airs;<br/>The light clear element which the isle wears<br/>Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,<br/>Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers.<br/>And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;<br/>And from the moss violets and jonquils peep,<br/>And dart their arrowy odour through the brain<br/>Till you might faint with that delicious pain.<br/>And every motion, odour, beam and tone,<br/>With that deep music is in unison:<br/>Which is a soul within the soul--they seem<br/>Like echoes of an antenatal dream.--<br/>It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,<br/>Cradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;<br/>Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,<br/>Washed by the soft blue Oceans of young air.<br/>It is a favoured place. Famine or Blight,<br/>Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light<br/>Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they<br/>Sail onward far upon their fatal way:<br/>The winged storms, chanting their thunder-psalm<br/>To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm<br/>Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,<br/>From which its fields and woods ever renew<br/>Their green and golden immortality.<br/>And from the sea there rise, and from the sky<br/>There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright.<br/>Veil after veil, each hiding some delight,<br/>Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,<br/>Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride<br/>Glowing at once with love and loveliness,<br/>Blushes and trembles at its own excess:<br/>Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less<br/>Burns in the heart of this delicious isle,<br/>An atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile<br/>Unfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen<br/>O'er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,<br/>Filling their bare and void interstices.--<br/>But the chief marvel of the wilderness<br/>Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how<br/>None of the rustic island-people know:<br/>'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height<br/>It overtops the woods; but, for delight,<br/>Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime<br/>Had been invented, in the world's young prime,<br/>Reared it, a wonder of that simple time,<br/>An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house<br/>Made sacred to his sister and his spouse.<br/>It scarce seems now a wreck of human art,<br/>But, as it were Titanic; in the heart<br/>Of Earth having assumed its form, then grown<br/>Out of the mountains, from the living stone,<br/>Lifting itself in caverns light and high:<br/>For all the antique and learned imagery<br/>Has been erased, and in the place of it<br/>The ivy and the wild-vine interknit<br/>The volumes of their many-twining stems;<br/>Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems<br/>The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky<br/>Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery<br/>With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,<br/>Or fragments of the day's intense serene;--<br/>Working mosaic on their Parian floors.<br/>And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers<br/>And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem<br/>To sleep in one another's arms, and dream<br/>Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we<br/>Read in their smiles, and call reality.<br/><br/>This isle and house are mine, and I have vowed<br/>Thee to be lady of the solitude.--<br/>And I have fitted up some chambers there<br/>Looking towards the golden Eastern air,<br/>And level with the living winds, which flow<br/>Like waves above the living waves below.--<br/>I have sent books and music there, and all<br/>Those instruments with which high Spirits call<br/>The future from its cradle, and the past<br/>Out of its grave, and make the present last<br/>In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,<br/>Folded within their own eternity.<br/>Our simple life wants little, and true taste<br/>Hires not the pale drudge Luxury, to waste<br/>The scene it would adorn, and therefore still,<br/>Nature with all her children haunts the hill.<br/>The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet<br/>Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit<br/>Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance<br/>Between the quick bats in their twilight dance;<br/>The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight<br/>Before our gate, and the slow, silent night<br/>Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep.<br/>Be this our home in life, and when years heap<br/>Their withered hours, like leaves, on our decay,<br/>Let us become the overhanging day,<br/>The living soul of this Elysian isle,<br/>Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile<br/>We two will rise, and sit, and walk together,<br/>Under the roof of blue Ionian weather,<br/>And wander in the meadows, or ascend<br/>The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend<br/>With lightest winds, to touch their paramour;<br/>Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore,<br/>Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea<br/>Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy,--<br/>Possessing and possessed by all that is<br/>Within that calm circumference of bliss,<br/>And by each other, till to love and live<br/>Be one:--or, at the noontide hour, arrive<br/>Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep<br/>The moonlight of the expired night asleep,<br/>Through which the awakened day can never peep;<br/>A veil for our seclusion, close as night's,<br/>Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights:<br/>Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain<br/>Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again.<br/>And we will talk, until thought's melody<br/>Become too sweet for utterance, and it die<br/>In words, to live again in looks, which dart<br/>With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,<br/>Harmonizing silence without a sound.<br/>Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,<br/>And our veins beat together; and our lips<br/>With other eloquence than words, eclipse<br/>The soul that burns between them, and the wells<br/>Which boil under our being's inmost cells,<br/>The fountains of our deepest life, shall be<br/>Confused in Passion's golden purity,<br/>As mountain-springs under the morning sun.<br/>We shall become the same, we shall be one<br/>Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?<br/>One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,<br/>Till like two meteors of expanding flame,<br/>Those spheres instinct with it become the same,<br/>Touch, mingle, are transfigured; ever still<br/>Burning, yet ever inconsumable:<br/>In one another's substance finding food,<br/>Like flames too pure and light and unimbued<br/>To nourish their bright lives with baser prey,<br/>Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away:<br/>One hope within two wills, one will beneath<br/>Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,<br/>One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,<br/>And one annihilation. Woe is me!<br/>The winged words on which my soul would pierce<br/>Into the height of Love's rare Universe,<br/>Are chains of lead around its flight of fire--<br/>I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Weak Verses, go, kneel at your Sovereign's feet,<br/>And say:--'We are the masters of thy slave;<br/>What wouldest thou with us and ours and thine?'<br/>Then call your sisters from Oblivion's cave,<br/>All singing loud: 'Love's very pain is sweet,<br/>But its reward is in the world divine<br/>Which, if not here, it builds beyond the grave.'<br/>So shall ye live when I am there. Then haste<br/>Over the hearts of men, until ye meet<br/>Marina, Vanna, Primus, and the rest,<br/>And bid them love each other and be blessed:<br/>And leave the troop which errs, and which reproves,<br/>And come and be my guest,--for I am Love's.
