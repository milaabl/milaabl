# üíÆ Paradise Regained: The Fourth Book by *John Milton*

<p>
    Perplexed and troubled at his bad success<br/>The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply,<br/>Discovered in his fraud, thrown from his hope<br/>So oft, and the persuasive rhetoric<br/>That sleeked his tongue, and won so much on Eve,<br/>So little here, nay lost.  But Eve was Eve;<br/>This far his over-match, who, self-deceived<br/>And rash, beforehand had no better weighed<br/>The strength he was to cope with, or his own.<br/>But‚Äîas a man who had been matchless held<br/>In cunning, over-reached where least he thought,<br/>To salve his credit, and for very spite,<br/>Still will be tempting him who foils him still,<br/>And never cease, though to his shame the more;<br/>Or as a swarm of flies in vintage-time,<br/>About the wine-press where sweet must is poured,<br/>Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound;<br/>Or surging waves against a solid rock,<br/>Though all to shivers dashed, the assault renew,<br/>(Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end‚Äî<br/>So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse<br/>Met ever, and to shameful silence brought,<br/>Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success,<br/>And his vain importunity pursues.<br/>He brought our Saviour to the western side<br/>Of that high mountain, whence he might behold<br/>Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide,<br/>Washed by the southern sea, and on the north<br/>To equal length backed with a ridge of hills<br/>That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men<br/>From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst<br/>Divided by a river, off whose banks<br/>On each side an Imperial City stood,<br/>With towers and temples proudly elevate<br/>On seven small hills, with palaces adorned,<br/>Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts,<br/>Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs,<br/>Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes<br/>Above the highth of mountains interposed‚Äî<br/>By what strange parallax, or optic skill<br/>Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass<br/>Of telescope, were curious to enquire.<br/>And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:‚Äî<br/>  "The city which thou seest no other deem<br/>Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth<br/>So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched<br/>Of nations.  There the Capitol thou seest,<br/>Above the rest lifting his stately head<br/>On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel<br/>Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine,<br/>The imperial palace, compass huge, and high<br/>The structure, skill of noblest architects,<br/>With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,<br/>Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires.<br/>Many a fair edifice besides, more like<br/>Houses of gods‚Äîso well I have disposed<br/>My aerie microscope‚Äîthou may'st behold,<br/>Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs<br/>Carved work, the hand of famed artificers<br/>In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold.<br/>Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see<br/>What conflux issuing forth, or entering in:<br/>Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces<br/>Hasting, or on return, in robes of state;<br/>Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power;<br/>Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings;<br/>Or embassies from regions far remote,<br/>In various habits, on the Appian road,<br/>Or on the AEmilian‚Äîsome from farthest south,<br/>Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,<br/>Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west,<br/>The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea;<br/>From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these),<br/>From India and the Golden Chersoness,<br/>And utmost Indian isle Taprobane,<br/>Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed;<br/>From Gallia, Gades, and the British west;<br/>Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north<br/>Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool.<br/>All nations now to Rome obedience pay‚Äî<br/>To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain,<br/>In ample territory, wealth and power,<br/>Civility of manners, arts and arms,<br/>And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer<br/>Before the Parthian.  These two thrones except,<br/>The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight,<br/>Shared among petty kings too far removed;<br/>These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all<br/>The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory.<br/>This Emperor hath no son, and now is old,<br/>Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired<br/>To Capreae, an island small but strong<br/>On the Campanian shore, with purpose there<br/>His horrid lusts in private to enjoy;<br/>Committing to a wicked favourite<br/>All public cares, and yet of him suspicious;<br/>Hated of all, and hating.  With what ease,<br/>Endued with regal virtues as thou art,<br/>Appearing, and beginning noble deeds,<br/>Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne,<br/>Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending,<br/>A victor-people free from servile yoke!<br/>And with my help thou may'st; to me the power<br/>Is given, and by that right I give it thee.<br/>Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world;<br/>Aim at the highest; without the highest attained,<br/>Will be for thee no sitting, or not long,<br/>On David's throne, be prophesied what will."<br/>  To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:‚Äî<br/>"Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew<br/>Of luxury, though called magnificence,<br/>More than of arms before, allure mine eye,<br/>Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell<br/>Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts<br/>On citron tables or Atlantic stone<br/>(For I have also heard, perhaps have read),<br/>Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne,<br/>Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold,<br/>Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems<br/>And studs of pearl‚Äîto me should'st tell, who thirst<br/>And hunger still.  Then embassies thou shew'st<br/>From nations far and nigh!  What honour that,<br/>But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear<br/>So many hollow compliments and lies,<br/>Outlandish flatteries?  Then proceed'st to talk<br/>Of the Emperor, how easily subdued,<br/>How gloriously.  I shall, thou say'st, expel<br/>A brutish monster: what if I withal<br/>Expel a Devil who first made him such?<br/>Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out;<br/>For him I was not sent, nor yet to free<br/>That people, victor once, now vile and base,<br/>Deservedly made vassal‚Äîwho, once just,<br/>Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well,<br/>But govern ill the nations under yoke,<br/>Peeling their provinces, exhausted all<br/>By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown<br/>Of triumph, that insulting vanity;<br/>Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured<br/>Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed;<br/>Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still,<br/>And from the daily Scene effeminate.<br/>What wise and valiant man would seek to free<br/>These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved,<br/>Or could of inward slaves make outward free?<br/>Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit<br/>On David's throne, it shall be like a tree<br/>Spreading and overshadowing all the earth,<br/>Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash<br/>All monarchies besides throughout the world;<br/>And of my Kingdom there shall be no end.<br/>Means there shall be to this; but what the means<br/>Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell."<br/>  To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:‚Äî<br/>"I see all offers made by me how slight<br/>Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st.<br/>Nothing will please the difficult and nice,<br/>Or nothing more than still to contradict.<br/>On the other side know also thou that I<br/>On what I offer set as high esteem,<br/>Nor what I part with mean to give for naught,<br/>All these, which in a moment thou behold'st,<br/>The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give<br/>(For, given to me, I give to whom I please),<br/>No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else‚Äî<br/>On this condition, if thou wilt fall down,<br/>And worship me as thy superior Lord<br/>(Easily done), and hold them all of me;<br/>For what can less so great a gift deserve?"<br/>  Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:‚Äî<br/>"I never liked thy talk, thy offers less;<br/>Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter<br/>The abominable terms, impious condition.<br/>But I endure the time, till which expired<br/>Thou hast permission on me.  It is written,<br/>The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship<br/>The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.'<br/>And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound<br/>To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed<br/>For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve,<br/>And more blasphemous; which expect to rue.<br/>The kingdoms of the world to thee were given!<br/>Permitted rather, and by thee usurped;<br/>Other donation none thou canst produce.<br/>If given, by whom but by the King of kings,<br/>God over all supreme?  If given to thee,<br/>By thee how fairly is the Giver now<br/>Repaid!  But gratitude in thee is lost<br/>Long since.  Wert thou so void of fear or shame<br/>As offer them to me, the Son of God‚Äî<br/>To me my own, on such abhorred pact,<br/>That I fall down and worship thee as God?<br/>Get thee behind me!  Plain thou now appear'st<br/>That Evil One, Satan for ever damned."<br/>  To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:‚Äî<br/>"Be not so sore offended, Son of God‚Äî<br/>Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men‚Äî<br/>If I, to try whether in higher sort<br/>Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed<br/>What both from Men and Angels I receive,<br/>Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth<br/>Nations besides from all the quartered winds‚Äî<br/>God of this World invoked, and World beneath.<br/>Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold<br/>To me most fatal, me it most concerns.<br/>The trial hath indamaged thee no way,<br/>Rather more honour left and more esteem;<br/>Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed.<br/>Therefore let pass, as they are transitory,<br/>The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more<br/>Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not.<br/>And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined<br/>Than to a worldly crown, addicted more<br/>To contemplation and profound dispute;<br/>As by that early action may be judged,<br/>When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st<br/>Alone into the Temple, there wast found<br/>Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant<br/>On points and questions fitting Moses' chair,<br/>Teaching, not taught.  The childhood shews the man,<br/>As morning shews the day.  Be famous, then,<br/>By wisdom; as thy empire must extend,<br/>So let extend thy mind o'er all the world<br/>In knowledge; all things in it comprehend.<br/>All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law,<br/>The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote;<br/>The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach<br/>To admiration, led by Nature's light;<br/>And with the Gentiles much thou must converse,<br/>Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st.<br/>Without their learning, how wilt thou with them,<br/>Or they with thee, hold conversation meet?<br/>How wilt thou reason with them, how refute<br/>Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes?<br/>Error by his own arms is best evinced.<br/>Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount,<br/>Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold<br/>Where on the AEgean shore a city stands,<br/>Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil‚Äî<br/>Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts<br/>And Eloquence, native to famous wits<br/>Or hospitable, in her sweet recess,<br/>City or suburban, studious walks and shades.<br/>See there the olive-grove of Academe,<br/>Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird<br/>Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long;<br/>There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound<br/>Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites<br/>To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls<br/>His whispering stream.  Within the walls then view<br/>The schools of ancient sages‚Äîhis who bred<br/>Great Alexander to subdue the world,<br/>Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next.<br/>There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power<br/>Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit<br/>By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,<br/>AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,<br/>And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,<br/>Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called,<br/>Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.<br/>Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught<br/>In chorus or iambic, teachers best<br/>Of moral prudence, with delight received<br/>In brief sententious precepts, while they treat<br/>Of fate, and chance, and change in human life,<br/>High actions and high passions best describing.<br/>Thence to the famous Orators repair,<br/>Those ancient whose resistless eloquence<br/>Wielded at will that fierce democraty,<br/>Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece<br/>To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne.<br/>To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,<br/>From heaven descended to the low-roofed house<br/>Of Socrates‚Äîsee there his tenement‚Äî<br/>Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced<br/>Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth<br/>Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools<br/>Of Academics old and new, with those<br/>Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect<br/>Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.<br/>These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home,<br/>Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight;<br/>These rules will render thee a king complete<br/>Within thyself, much more with empire joined."<br/>  To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:‚Äî<br/>"Think not but that I know these things; or, think<br/>I know them not, not therefore am I short<br/>Of knowing what I ought.  He who receives<br/>Light from above, from the Fountain of Light,<br/>No other doctrine needs, though granted true;<br/>But these are false, or little else but dreams,<br/>Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm.<br/>The first and wisest of them all professed<br/>To know this only, that he nothing knew;<br/>The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits;<br/>A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense;<br/>Others in virtue placed felicity,<br/>But virtue joined with riches and long life;<br/>In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease;<br/>The Stoic last in philosophic pride,<br/>By him called virtue, and his virtuous man,<br/>Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing,<br/>Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer,<br/>As fearing God nor man, contemning all<br/>Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life‚Äî<br/>Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can;<br/>For all his tedious talk is but vain boast,<br/>Or subtle shifts conviction to evade.<br/>Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead,<br/>Ignorant of themselves, of God much more,<br/>And how the World began, and how Man fell,<br/>Degraded by himself, on grace depending?<br/>Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry;<br/>And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves<br/>All glory arrogate, to God give none;<br/>Rather accuse him under usual names,<br/>Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite<br/>Of mortal things.  Who, therefore, seeks in these<br/>True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion<br/>Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,<br/>An empty cloud.  However, many books,<br/>Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads<br/>Incessantly, and to his reading brings not<br/>A spirit and judgment equal or superior,<br/>(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)<br/>Uncertain and unsettled still remains,<br/>Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,<br/>Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys<br/>And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,<br/>As children gathering pebbles on the shore.<br/>Or, if I would delight my private hours<br/>With music or with poem, where so soon<br/>As in our native language can I find<br/>That solace?  All our Law and Story strewed<br/>With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed,<br/>Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon<br/>That pleased so well our victor's ear, declare<br/>That rather Greece from us these arts derived‚Äî<br/>Ill imitated while they loudest sing<br/>The vices of their deities, and their own,<br/>In fable, hymn, or song, so personating<br/>Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame.<br/>Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid<br/>As varnish on a harlot's cheek, the rest,<br/>Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight,<br/>Will far be found unworthy to compare<br/>With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling,<br/>Where God is praised aright and godlike men,<br/>The Holiest of Holies and his Saints<br/>(Such are from God inspired, not such from thee);<br/>Unless where moral virtue is expressed<br/>By light of Nature, not in all quite lost.<br/>Their orators thou then extoll'st as those<br/>The top of eloquence‚Äîstatists indeed,<br/>And lovers of their country, as may seem;<br/>But herein to our Prophets far beneath,<br/>As men divinely taught, and better teaching<br/>The solid rules of civil government,<br/>In their majestic, unaffected style,<br/>Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome.<br/>In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt,<br/>What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so,<br/>What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat;<br/>These only, with our Law, best form a king."<br/>  So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now<br/>Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent),<br/>Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:‚Äî<br/>  "Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts,<br/>Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught<br/>By me proposed in life contemplative<br/>Or active, tended on by glory or fame,<br/>What dost thou in this world?  The Wilderness<br/>For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,<br/>And thither will return thee.  Yet remember<br/>What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause<br/>To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus<br/>Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,<br/>Which would have set thee in short time with ease<br/>On David's throne, or throne of all the world,<br/>Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,<br/>When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.<br/>Now, contrary‚Äîif I read aught in heaven,<br/>Or heaven write aught of fate‚Äîby what the stars<br/>Voluminous, or single characters<br/>In their conjunction met, give me to spell,<br/>Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,<br/>Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,<br/>Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death.<br/>A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,<br/>Real or allegoric, I discern not;<br/>Nor when: eternal sure‚Äîas without end,<br/>Without beginning; for no date prefixed<br/>Directs me in the starry rubric set."<br/>  So saying, he took (for still he knew his power<br/>Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness<br/>Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,<br/>Feigning to disappear.  Darkness now rose,<br/>As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,<br/>Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,<br/>Privation mere of light and absent day.<br/>Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind<br/>After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,<br/>Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,<br/>Wherever, under some concourse of shades,<br/>Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield<br/>From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;<br/>But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head<br/>The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams<br/>Disturbed his sleep.  And either tropic now<br/>'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds<br/>From many a horrid rift abortive poured<br/>Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,<br/>In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds<br/>Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad<br/>From the four hinges of the world, and fell<br/>On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,<br/>Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,<br/>Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,<br/>Or torn up sheer.  Ill wast thou shrouded then,<br/>O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st<br/>Unshaken!  Nor yet staid the terror there:<br/>Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round<br/>Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,<br/>Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou<br/>Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.<br/>Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair<br/>Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,<br/>Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar<br/>Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,<br/>And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised<br/>To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.<br/>And now the sun with more effectual beams<br/>Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet<br/>From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,<br/>Who all things now behold more fresh and green,<br/>After a night of storm so ruinous,<br/>Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,<br/>To gratulate the sweet return of morn.<br/>Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,<br/>Was absent, after all his mischief done,<br/>The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem<br/>Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;<br/>Yet with no new device (they all were spent),<br/>Rather by this his last affront resolved,<br/>Desperate of better course, to vent his rage<br/>And mad despite to be so oft repelled.<br/>Him walking on a sunny hill he found,<br/>Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;<br/>Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,<br/>And in a careless mood thus to him said:‚Äî<br/>  "Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,<br/>After a dismal night.  I heard the wrack,<br/>As earth and sky would mingle; but myself<br/>Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,<br/>As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,<br/>Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath,<br/>Are to the main as inconsiderable<br/>And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze<br/>To man's less universe, and soon are gone.<br/>Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light<br/>On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,<br/>Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,<br/>Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,<br/>They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.<br/>This tempest at this desert most was bent;<br/>Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.<br/>Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject<br/>The perfect season offered with my aid<br/>To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong<br/>All to the push of fate, pursue thy way<br/>Of gaining David's throne no man knows when<br/>(For both the when and how is nowhere told),<br/>Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;<br/>For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing<br/>The time and means?  Each act is rightliest done<br/>Not when it must, but when it may be best.<br/>If thou observe not this, be sure to find<br/>What I foretold thee‚Äîmany a hard assay<br/>Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,<br/>Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;<br/>Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,<br/>So many terrors, voices, prodigies,<br/>May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign."<br/>  So talked he, while the Son of God went on,<br/>And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:‚Äî<br/>  "Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm<br/>Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none.<br/>I never feared they could, though noising loud<br/>And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs<br/>Betokening or ill-boding I contemn<br/>As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;<br/>Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,<br/>Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,<br/>At least might seem to hold all power of thee,<br/>Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God;<br/>And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify<br/>Me to thy will!  Desist (thou art discerned,<br/>And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest."<br/>  To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:‚Äî<br/>"Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!<br/>For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.<br/>Of the Messiah I have heard foretold<br/>By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length<br/>Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew,<br/>And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field,<br/>On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born.<br/>From that time seldom have I ceased to eye<br/>Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,<br/>Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;<br/>Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all<br/>Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest<br/>(Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven<br/>Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.<br/>Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view<br/>And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn<br/>In what degree or meaning thou art called<br/>The Son of God, which bears no single sense.<br/>The Son of God I also am, or was;<br/>And, if I was, I am; relation stands:<br/>All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought<br/>In some respect far higher so declared.<br/>Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,<br/>And followed thee still on to this waste wild,<br/>Where, by all best conjectures, I collect<br/>Thou art to be my fatal enemy.<br/>Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek<br/>To understand my adversary, who<br/>And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent;<br/>By parle or composition, truce or league,<br/>To win him, or win from him what I can.<br/>And opportunity I here have had<br/>To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee<br/>Proof against all temptation, as a rock<br/>Of adamant and as a centre, firm<br/>To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,<br/>Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,<br/>Have been before contemned, and may again.<br/>Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,<br/>Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,<br/>Another method I must now begin."<br/>  So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing<br/>Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,<br/>Over the wilderness and o'er the plain,<br/>Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,<br/>The Holy City, lifted high her towers,<br/>And higher yet the glorious Temple reared<br/>Her pile, far off appearing like a mount<br/>Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:<br/>There, on the highest pinnacle, he set<br/>The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:‚Äî<br/>  "There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright<br/>Will ask thee skill.  I to thy Father's house<br/>Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best.<br/>Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand,<br/>Cast thyself down.  Safely, if Son of God;<br/>For it is written, 'He will give command<br/>Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands<br/>They shall uplift thee, lest at any time<br/>Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'"<br/>  To whom thus Jesus: "Also it is written,<br/>'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'"  He said, and stood;<br/>But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.<br/>As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare<br/>Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove<br/>With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose,<br/>Receiving from his mother Earth new strength,<br/>Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined,<br/>Throttled at length in the air expired and fell,<br/>So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud,<br/>Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride<br/>Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;<br/>And, as that Theban monster that proposed<br/>Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured,<br/>That once found out and solved, for grief and spite<br/>Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,<br/>So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,<br/>And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought<br/>Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,<br/>Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,<br/>Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.<br/>So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe<br/>Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,<br/>Who on their plumy vans received Him soft<br/>From his uneasy station, and upbore,<br/>As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;<br/>Then, in a flowery valley, set him down<br/>On a green bank, and set before him spread<br/>A table of celestial food, divine<br/>Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,<br/>And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,<br/>That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired<br/>What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,<br/>Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires<br/>Sung heavenly anthems of his victory<br/>Over temptation and the Tempter proud:‚Äî<br/>  "True Image of the Father, whether throned<br/>In the bosom of bliss, and light of light<br/>Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined<br/>In fleshly tabernacle and human form,<br/>Wandering the wilderness‚Äîwhatever place,<br/>Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing<br/>The Son of God, with Godlike force endued<br/>Against the attempter of thy Father's throne<br/>And thief of Paradise!  Him long of old<br/>Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast<br/>With all his army; now thou hast avenged<br/>Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing<br/>Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,<br/>And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.<br/>He never more henceforth will dare set foot<br/>In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.<br/>For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,<br/>A fairer Paradise is founded now<br/>For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,<br/>A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;<br/>Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,<br/>Of tempter and temptation without fear.<br/>But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long<br/>Rule in the clouds.  Like an autumnal star,<br/>Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down<br/>Under his feet.  For proof, ere this thou feel'st<br/>Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)<br/>By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell<br/>No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues<br/>Thy bold attempt.  Hereafter learn with awe<br/>To dread the Son of God.  He, all unarmed,<br/>Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,<br/>From thy demoniac holds, possession foul‚Äî<br/>Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,<br/>And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,<br/>Lest he command them down into the Deep,<br/>Bound, and to torment sent before their time.<br/>Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,<br/>Queller of Satan!  On thy glorious work<br/>Now enter, and begin to save Mankind."<br/>  Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,<br/>Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,<br/>Brought on his way with joy.  He, unobserved,<br/>Home to his mother's house private returned.<br/><br/>THE END
