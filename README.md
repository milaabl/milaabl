# üíÆ Charles the First by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    SCENE 1:<br/>THE MASQUE OF THE INNS OF COURT.<br/><br/>A PURSUIVANT:<br/>Place, for the Marshal of the Masque!<br/><br/>FIRST CITIZEN:<br/>What thinkest thou of this quaint masque which turns,<br/>Like morning from the shadow of the night,<br/>The night to day, and London to a place<br/>Of peace and joy?<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>And Hell to Heaven.<br/>Eight years are gone,<br/>And they seem hours, since in this populous street<br/>I trod on grass made green by summer's rain,<br/>For the red plague kept state within that palace<br/>Where now that vanity reigns. In nine years more<br/>The roots will be refreshed with civil blood;<br/>And thank the mercy of insulted Heaven<br/>That sin and wrongs wound, as an orphan's cry,<br/>The patience of the great Avenger's ear.<br/><br/>A YOUTH:<br/>Yet, father, 'tis a happy sight to see,<br/>Beautiful, innocent, and unforbidden<br/>By God or man;--'tis like the bright procession<br/>Of skiey visions in a solemn dream<br/>From which men wake as from a Paradise,<br/>And draw new strength to tread the thorns of life.<br/>If God be good, wherefore should this be evil?<br/>And if this be not evil, dost thou not draw<br/>Unseasonable poison from the flowers<br/>Which bloom so rarely in this barren world?<br/>Oh, kill these bitter thoughts which make the present<br/>Dark as the future!--<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>When Avarice and Tyranny, vigilant Fear,<br/>And open-eyed Conspiracy lie sleeping<br/>As on Hell's threshold; and all gentle thoughts<br/>Waken to worship Him who giveth joys<br/>With His own gift.<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>How young art thou in this old age of time!<br/>How green in this gray world? Canst thou discern<br/>The signs of seasons, yet perceive no hint<br/>Of change in that stage-scene in which thou art<br/>Not a spectator but an actor? or<br/>Art thou a puppet moved by ?<br/>The day that dawns in fire will die in storms,<br/>Even though the noon be calm. My travel's done,--<br/>Before the whirlwind wakes I shall have found<br/>My inn of lasting rest; but thou must still<br/>Be journeying on in this inclement air.<br/>Wrap thy old cloak about thy back;<br/>Nor leave the broad and plain and beaten road,<br/>Although no flowers smile on the trodden dust,<br/>For the violet paths of pleasure. This Charles the First<br/>Rose like the equinoctial sun,...<br/>By vapours, through whose threatening ominous veil<br/>Darting his altered influence he has gained<br/>This height of noon--from which he must decline<br/>Amid the darkness of conflicting storms,<br/>To dank extinction and to latest night...<br/>There goes<br/>The apostate Strafford; he whose titles<br/>whispered aphorisms<br/>From Machiavel and Bacon: and, if Judas<br/>Had been as brazen and as bold as he--<br/><br/>FIRST CITIZEN:<br/>That<br/>Is the Archbishop.<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>Rather say the Pope:<br/>London will be soon his Rome: he walks<br/>As if he trod upon the heads of men:<br/>He looks elate, drunken with blood and gold;--<br/>Beside him moves the Babylonian woman<br/>Invisibly, and with her as with his shadow,<br/>Mitred adulterer! he is joined in sin,<br/>Which turns Heaven's milk of mercy to revenge.<br/><br/>THIRD CITIZEN [LIFTING UP HIS EYES]:<br/>Good Lord! rain it down upon him!...<br/>Amid her ladies walks the papist queen,<br/>As if her nice feet scorned our English earth.<br/>The Canaanitish Jezebel! I would be<br/>A dog if I might tear her with my teeth!<br/>There's old Sir Henry Vane, the Earl of Pembroke,<br/>Lord Essex, and Lord Keeper Coventry,<br/>And others who make base their English breed<br/>By vile participation of their honours<br/>With papists, atheists, tyrants, and apostates.<br/>When lawyers masque 'tis time for honest men<br/>To strip the vizor from their purposes.<br/>A seasonable time for masquers this!<br/>When Englishmen and Protestants should sit<br/>dust on their dishonoured heads<br/>To avert the wrath of Him whose scourge is felt<br/>For the great sins which have drawn down from Heaven<br/>and foreign overthrow.<br/>The remnant of the martyred saints in Rochefort<br/>Have been abandoned by their faithless allies<br/>To that idolatrous and adulterous torturer<br/>Lewis of France,--the Palatinate is lost--<br/>[ENTER LEIGHTON (WHO HAS BEEN BRANDED IN THE FACE) AND BASTWICK.]<br/>Canst thou be--art thou?<br/><br/>LEIGHTON:<br/>I WAS Leighton: what<br/>I AM thou seest. And yet turn thine eyes,<br/>And with thy memory look on thy friend's mind,<br/>Which is unchanged, and where is written deep<br/>The sentence of my judge.<br/><br/>THIRD CITIZEN:<br/>Are these the marks with which<br/>Laud thinks to improve the image of his Maker<br/>Stamped on the face of man? Curses upon him,<br/>The impious tyrant!<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>It is said besides<br/>That lewd and papist drunkards may profane<br/>The Sabbath with their<br/>And has permitted that most heathenish custom<br/>Of dancing round a pole dressed up with wreaths<br/>On May-day.<br/>A man who thus twice crucifies his God<br/>May well ... his brother.--In my mind, friend,<br/>The root of all this ill is prelacy.<br/>I would cut up the root.<br/><br/>THIRD CITIZEN:<br/>And by what means?<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>Smiting each Bishop under the fifth rib.<br/><br/>THIRD CITIZEN:<br/>You seem to know the vulnerable place<br/>Of these same crocodiles.<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>I learnt it in<br/>Egyptian bondage, sir. Your worm of Nile<br/>Betrays not with its flattering tears like they;<br/>For, when they cannot kill, they whine and weep.<br/>Nor is it half so greedy of men's bodies<br/>As they of soul and all; nor does it wallow<br/>In slime as they in simony and lies<br/>And close lusts of the flesh.<br/><br/>A MARSHALSMAN:<br/>Give place, give place!<br/>You torch-bearers, advance to the great gate,<br/>And then attend the Marshal of the Masque<br/>Into the Royal presence.<br/><br/>A LAW STUDENT:<br/>What thinkest thou<br/>Of this quaint show of ours, my aged friend?<br/>Even now we see the redness of the torches<br/>Inflame the night to the eastward, and the clarions<br/> to us on the wind's wave. It comes!<br/>And their sounds, floating hither round the pageant,<br/>Rouse up the astonished air.<br/><br/>FIRST CITIZEN:<br/>I will not think but that our country's wounds<br/>May yet be healed. The king is just and gracious,<br/>Though wicked counsels now pervert his will:<br/>These once cast off--<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>As adders cast their skins<br/>And keep their venom, so kings often change;<br/>Councils and counsellors hang on one another,<br/>Hiding the loathsome<br/>Like the base patchwork of a leper's rags.<br/><br/>THE YOUTH:<br/>Oh, still those dissonant thoughts!--List how the music<br/>Grows on the enchanted air! And see, the torches<br/>Restlessly flashing, and the crowd divided<br/>Like waves before an admiral's prow!<br/><br/>A MARSHALSMAN:<br/>Give place<br/>To the Marshal of the Masque!<br/><br/>A PURSUIVANT:<br/>Room for the King!<br/><br/>THE YOUTH:<br/>How glorious! See those thronging chariots<br/>Rolling, like painted clouds before the wind,<br/>Behind their solemn steeds: how some are shaped<br/>Like curved sea-shells dyed by the azure depths<br/>Of Indian seas; some like the new-born moon;<br/>And some like cars in which the Romans climbed<br/>(Canopied by Victory's eagle-wings outspread)<br/>The Capitolian--See how gloriously<br/>The mettled horses in the torchlight stir<br/>Their gallant riders, while they check their pride,<br/>Like shapes of some diviner element<br/>Than English air, and beings nobler than<br/>The envious and admiring multitude.<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>Ay, there they are--<br/>Nobles, and sons of nobles, patentees,<br/>Monopolists, and stewards of this poor farm,<br/>On whose lean sheep sit the prophetic crows,<br/>Here is the pomp that strips the houseless orphan,<br/>Here is the pride that breaks the desolate heart.<br/>These are the lilies glorious as Solomon,<br/>Who toil not, neither do they spin,--unless<br/>It be the webs they catch poor rogues withal.<br/>Here is the surfeit which to them who earn<br/>The niggard wages of the earth, scarce leaves<br/>The tithe that will support them till they crawl<br/>Back to her cold hard bosom. Here is health<br/>Followed by grim disease, glory by shame,<br/>Waste by lame famine, wealth by squalid want,<br/>And England's sin by England's punishment.<br/>And, as the effect pursues the cause foregone,<br/>Lo, giving substance to my words, behold<br/>At once the sign and the thing signified--<br/>A troop of cripples, beggars, and lean outcasts,<br/>Horsed upon stumbling jades, carted with dung,<br/>Dragged for a day from cellars and low cabins<br/>And rotten hiding-holes, to point the moral<br/>Of this presentment, and bring up the rear<br/>Of painted pomp with misery!<br/><br/>THE YOUTH:<br/>'Tis but<br/>The anti-masque, and serves as discords do<br/>In sweetest music. Who would love May flowers<br/>If they succeeded not to Winter's flaw;<br/>Or day unchanged by night; or joy itself<br/>Without the touch of sorrow?<br/><br/>SECOND CITIZEN:<br/>I and thou-<br/><br/>A MARSHALSMAN:<br/>Place, give place!<br/><br/>SCENE 2:<br/>A CHAMBER IN WHITEHALL.<br/>ENTER THE KING, QUEEN, LAUD, LORD STRAFTORD,<br/>LORD COTTINGTON, AND OTHER LORDS; ARCHY;<br/>ALSO ST. JOHN, WITH SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE INNS OF COURT.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Thanks, gentlemen. I heartily accept<br/>This token of your service: your gay masque<br/>Was performed gallantly. And it shows well<br/>When subjects twine such flowers of<br/>With the sharp thorns that deck the English crown.<br/>A gentle heart enjoys what it confers,<br/>Even as it suffers that which it inflicts,<br/>Though Justice guides the stroke.<br/>Accept my hearty thanks.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>And gentlemen,<br/>Call your poor Queen your debtor. Your quaint pageant<br/>Rose on me like the figures of past years,<br/>Treading their still path back to infancy,<br/>More beautiful and mild as they draw nearer<br/>The quiet cradle. I could have almost wept<br/>To think I was in Paris, where these shows<br/>Are well devised--such as I was ere yet<br/>My young heart shared a portion of the burthen,<br/>The careful weight, of this great monarchy.<br/>There, gentlemen, between the sovereign's pleasure<br/>And that which it regards, no clamour lifts<br/>Its proud interposition.<br/>In Paris ribald censurers dare not move<br/>Their poisonous tongues against these sinless sports;<br/>And HIS smile<br/>Warms those who bask in it, as ours would do<br/>If ... Take my heart's thanks: add them, gentlemen,<br/>To those good words which, were he King of France,<br/>My royal lord would turn to golden deeds.<br/><br/>ST. JOHN:<br/>Madam, the love of Englishmen can make<br/>The lightest favour of their lawful king<br/>Outweigh a despot's.--We humbly take our leaves,<br/>Enriched by smiles which France can never buy.<br/><br/>[EXEUNT ST. JOHN AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE INNS OF COURT.]<br/><br/>KING:<br/>My Lord Archbishop,<br/>Mark you what spirit sits in St. John's eyes?<br/>Methinks it is too saucy for this presence.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Yes, pray your Grace look: for, like an unsophisticated  sees<br/>everything upside down, you who are wise will discern the shadow of an<br/>idiot in lawn sleeves and a rochet setting springes to catch woodcocks<br/>in haymaking time. Poor Archy, whose owl-eyes are tempered to the<br/>error of his age, and because he is a fool, and by special ordinance<br/>of God forbidden ever to see himself as he is, sees now in that deep<br/>eye a blindfold devil sitting on the ball, and weighing words out<br/>between king and subjects. One scale is full of promises, and the<br/>other full of protestations: and then another devil creeps behind the<br/>first out of the dark windings  pregnant lawyer's brain, and<br/>takes the bandage from the other's eyes, and throws a sword into the<br/>left-hand scale, for all the world like my Lord Essex's there.<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>A rod in pickle for the Fool's back!<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Ay, and some are now smiling whose tears will make the brine; for the<br/>Fool sees--<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>Insolent! You shall have your coat turned and be whipped out of the<br/>palace for this.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>When all the fools are whipped, and all the Protestant writers, while<br/>the knaves are whipping the fools ever since a thief was set to catch<br/>a thief. If all turncoats were whipped out of palaces, poor Archy<br/>would be disgraced in good company. Let the knaves whip the fools, and<br/>all the fools laugh at it.  wise and godly slit each other's<br/>noses and ears (having no need of any sense of discernment in their<br/>craft); and the knaves, to marshal them, join in a procession to<br/>Bedlam, to entreat the madmen to omit their sublime Platonic<br/>contemplations, and manage the state of England. Let all the honest<br/>men who lie  up at the prisons or the pillories, in custody<br/>of the pursuivants of the High-Commission Court, marshal them.<br/><br/>[ENTER SECRETARY LYTTELTON, WITH PAPERS.]<br/><br/>KING [LOOKING OVER THE PAPERS]:<br/>These stiff Scots<br/>His Grace of Canterbury must take order<br/>To force under the Church's yoke.--You, Wentworth,<br/>Shall be myself in Ireland, and shall add<br/>Your wisdom, gentleness, and energy,<br/>To what in me were wanting.--My Lord Weston,<br/>Look that those merchants draw not without loss<br/>Their bullion from the Tower; and, on the payment<br/>Of shipmoney, take fullest compensation<br/>For violation of our royal forests,<br/>Whose limits, from neglect, have been o'ergrown<br/>With cottages and cornfields. The uttermost<br/>Farthing exact from those who claim exemption<br/>From knighthood: that which once was a reward<br/>Shall thus be made a punishment, that subjects<br/>May know how majesty can wear at will<br/>The rugged mood.--My Lord of Coventry,<br/>Lay my command upon the Courts below<br/>That bail be not accepted for the prisoners<br/>Under the warrant of the Star Chamber.<br/>The people shall not find the stubbornness<br/>Of Parliament a cheap or easy method<br/>Of dealing with their rightful sovereign:<br/>And doubt not this, my Lord of Coventry,<br/>We will find time and place for fit rebuke.--<br/>My Lord of Canterbury.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>The fool is here.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>I crave permission of your Majesty<br/>To order that this insolent fellow be<br/>Chastised: he mocks the sacred character,<br/>Scoffs at the state, and--<br/><br/>KING:<br/>What, my Archy?<br/>He mocks and mimics all he sees and hears,<br/>Yet with a quaint and graceful licence--Prithee<br/>For this once do not as Prynne would, were he<br/>Primate of England. With your Grace's leave,<br/>He lives in his own world; and, like a parrot<br/>Hung in his gilded prison from the window<br/>Of a queen's bower over the public way,<br/>Blasphemes with a bird's mind:--his words, like arrows<br/>Which know no aim beyond the archer's wit,<br/>Strike sometimes what eludes philosophy.--<br/>[TO ARCHY.]<br/>Go, sirrah, and repent of your offence<br/>Ten minutes in the rain; be it your penance<br/>To bring news how the world goes there.<br/>[EXIT ARCHY.]<br/>Poor Archy!<br/>He weaves about himself a world of mirth<br/>Out of the wreck of ours.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>I take with patience, as my Master did,<br/>All scoffs permitted from above.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>My lord,<br/>Pray overlook these papers. Archy's words<br/>Had wings, but these have talons.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>And the lion<br/>That wears them must be tamed. My dearest lord,<br/>I see the new-born courage in your eye<br/>Armed to strike dead the Spirit of the Time,<br/>Which spurs to rage the many-headed beast.<br/>Do thou persist: for, faint but in resolve,<br/>And it were better thou hadst still remained<br/>The slave of thine own slaves, who tear like curs<br/>The fugitive, and flee from the pursuer;<br/>And Opportunity, that empty wolf,<br/>Flies at his throat who falls. Subdue thy actions<br/>Even to the disposition of thy purpose,<br/>And be that tempered as the Ebro's steel;<br/>And banish weak-eyed Mercy to the weak,<br/>Whence she will greet thee with a gift of peace<br/>And not betray thee with a traitor's kiss,<br/>As when she keeps the company of rebels,<br/>Who think that she is Fear. This do, lest we<br/>Should fall as from a glorious pinnacle<br/>In a bright dream, and wake as from a dream<br/>Out of our worshipped state.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Beloved friend,<br/>God is my witness that this weight of power,<br/>Which He sets me my earthly task to wield<br/>Under His law, is my delight and pride<br/>Only because thou lovest that and me.<br/>For a king bears the office of a God<br/>To all the under world; and to his God<br/>Alone he must deliver up his trust,<br/>Unshorn of its permitted attributes.<br/> now as the baser elements<br/>Had mutinied against the golden sun<br/>That kindles them to harmony, and quells<br/>Their self-destroying rapine. The wild million<br/>Strike at the eye that guides them; like as humours<br/>Of the distempered body that conspire<br/>Against the spirit of life throned in the heart,--<br/>And thus become the prey of one another,<br/>And last of death--<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>That which would be ambition in a subject<br/>Is duty in a sovereign; for on him,<br/>As on a keystone, hangs the arch of life,<br/>Whose safety is its strength. Degree and form,<br/>And all that makes the age of reasoning man<br/>More memorable than a beast's, depend on this--<br/>That Right should fence itself inviolably<br/>With Power; in which respect the state of England<br/>From usurpation by the insolent commons<br/>Cries for reform.<br/>Get treason, and spare treasure. Fee with coin<br/>The loudest murmurers; feed with jealousies<br/>Opposing factions,--be thyself of none;<br/>And borrow gold of many, for those who lend<br/>Will serve thee till thou payest them; and thus<br/>Keep the fierce spirit of the hour at bay,<br/>Till time, and its coming generations<br/>Of nights and days unborn, bring some one chance,<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Or war or pestilence or Nature's self,--<br/>By some distemperature or terrible sign,<br/>Be as an arbiter betwixt themselves.<br/>Nor let your Majesty<br/>Doubt here the peril of the unseen event.<br/>How did your brother Kings, coheritors<br/>In your high interest in the subject earth,<br/>Rise past such troubles to that height of power<br/>Where now they sit, and awfully serene<br/>Smile on the trembling world? Such popular storms<br/>Philip the Second of Spain, this Lewis of France,<br/>And late the German head of many bodies,<br/>And every petty lord of Italy,<br/>Quelled or by arts or arms. Is England poorer<br/>Or feebler? or art thou who wield'st her power<br/>Tamer than they? or shall this island be--<br/> by its inviolable waters--<br/>To the world present and the world to come<br/>Sole pattern of extinguished monarchy?<br/>Not if thou dost as I would have thee do.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Your words shall be my deeds:<br/>You speak the image of my thought. My friend<br/>(If Kings can have a friend, I call thee so),<br/>Beyond the large commission which<br/>Under the great seal of the realm, take this:<br/>And, for some obvious reasons, let there be<br/>No seal on it, except my kingly word<br/>And honour as I am a gentleman.<br/>Be--as thou art within my heart and mind--<br/>Another self, here and in Ireland:<br/>Do what thou judgest well, take amplest licence,<br/>And stick not even at questionable means.<br/>Hear me, Wentworth. My word is as a wall<br/>Between thee and this world thine enemy--<br/>That hates thee, for thou lovest me.<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>I own<br/>No friend but thee, no enemies but thine:<br/>Thy lightest thought is my eternal law.<br/>How weak, how short, is life to pay--<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Peace, peace.<br/>Thou ow'st me nothing yet.<br/>[TO LAUD.]<br/>My lord, what say<br/>Those papers?<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Your Majesty has ever interposed,<br/>In lenity towards your native soil,<br/>Between the heavy vengeance of the Church<br/>And Scotland. Mark the consequence of warming<br/>This brood of northern vipers in your bosom.<br/>The rabble, instructed no doubt<br/>By London, Lindsay, Hume, and false Argyll<br/>(For the waves never menace heaven until<br/>Scourged by the wind's invisible tyranny),<br/>Have in the very temple of the Lord<br/>Done outrage to His chosen ministers.<br/>They scorn the liturgy of the Holy Church,<br/>Refuse to obey her canons, and deny<br/>The apostolic power with which the Spirit<br/>Has filled its elect vessels, even from him<br/>Who held the keys with power to loose and bind,<br/>To him who now pleads in this royal presence.--<br/>Let ample powers and new instructions be<br/>Sent to the High Commissioners in Scotland.<br/>To death, imprisonment, and confiscation,<br/>Add torture, add the ruin of the kindred<br/>Of the offender, add the brand of infamy,<br/>Add mutilation: and if this suffice not,<br/>Unleash the sword and fire, that in their thirst<br/>They may lick up that scum of schismatics.<br/>I laugh at those weak rebels who, desiring<br/>What we possess, still prate of Christian peace,<br/>As if those dreadful arbitrating messengers<br/>Which play the part of God 'twixt right and wrong,<br/>Should be let loose against the innocent sleep<br/>Of templed cities and the smiling fields,<br/>For some poor argument of policy<br/>Which touches our own profit or our pride<br/>(Where it indeed were Christian charity<br/>To turn the cheek even to the smiter's hand):<br/>And, when our great Redeemer, when our God,<br/>When He who gave, accepted, and retained<br/>Himself in propitiation of our sins,<br/>Is scorned in His immediate ministry,<br/>With hazard of the inestimable loss<br/>Of all the truth and discipline which is<br/>Salvation to the extremest generation<br/>Of men innumerable, they talk of peace!<br/>Such peace as Canaan found, let Scotland now:<br/>For, by that Christ who came to bring a sword,<br/>Not peace, upon the earth, and gave command<br/>To His disciples at the Passover<br/>That each should sell his robe and buy a sword,-<br/>Once strip that minister of naked wrath,<br/>And it shall never sleep in peace again<br/>Till Scotland bend or break.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>My Lord Archbishop,<br/>Do what thou wilt and what thou canst in this.<br/>Thy earthly even as thy heavenly King<br/>Gives thee large power in his unquiet realm.<br/>But we want money, and my mind misgives me<br/>That for so great an enterprise, as yet,<br/>We are unfurnished.<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>Yet it may not long<br/>Rest on our wills.<br/><br/>COTTINGTON:<br/>The expenses<br/>Of gathering shipmoney, and of distraining<br/>For every petty rate (for we encounter<br/>A desperate opposition inch by inch<br/>In every warehouse and on every farm),<br/>Have swallowed up the gross sum of the imposts;<br/>So that, though felt as a most grievous scourge<br/>Upon the land, they stand us in small stead<br/>As touches the receipt.<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>'Tis a conclusion<br/>Most arithmetical: and thence you infer<br/>Perhaps the assembling of a parliament.<br/>Now, if a man should call his dearest enemies<br/>T0 sit in licensed judgement on his life,<br/>His Majesty might wisely take that course.<br/>[ASIDE TO COTTINGTON.]<br/>It is enough to expect from these lean imposts<br/>That they perform the office of a scourge,<br/>Without more profit.<br/>[ALOUD.]<br/>Fines and confiscations,<br/>And a forced loan from the refractory city,<br/>Will fill our coffers: and the golden love<br/>Of loyal gentlemen and noble friends<br/>For the worshipped father of our common country,<br/>With contributions from the catholics,<br/>Will make Rebellion pale in our excess.<br/>Be these the expedients until time and wisdom<br/>Shall frame a settled state of government.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>And weak expedients they! Have we not drained<br/>All, till the ... which seemed<br/>A mine exhaustless?<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>And the love which IS,<br/>If loyal hearts could turn their blood to gold.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Both now grow barren: and I speak it not<br/>As loving parliaments, which, as they have been<br/>In the right hand of bold bad mighty kings<br/>The scourges of the bleeding Church, I hate.<br/>Methinks they scarcely can deserve our fear.<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>Oh! my dear liege, take back the wealth thou gavest:<br/>With that, take all I held, but as in trust<br/>For thee, of mine inheritance: leave me but<br/>This unprovided body for thy service,<br/>And a mind dedicated to no care<br/>Except thy safety:--but assemble not<br/>A parliament. Hundreds will bring, like me,<br/>Their fortunes, as they would their blood, before--<br/><br/>KING:<br/>No! thou who judgest them art but one. Alas!<br/>We should be too much out of love with Heaven,<br/>Did this vile world show many such as thee,<br/>Thou perfect, just, and honourable man!<br/>Never shall it be said that Charles of England<br/>Stripped those he loved for fear of those he scorns;<br/>Nor will he so much misbecome his throne<br/>As to impoverish those who most adorn<br/>And best defend it. That you urge, dear Strafford,<br/>Inclines me rather--<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>To a parliament?<br/>Is this thy firmness? and thou wilt preside<br/>Over a knot of ... censurers,<br/>To the unswearing of thy best resolves,<br/>And choose the worst, when the worst comes too soon?<br/>Plight not the worst before the worst must come.<br/>Oh, wilt thou smile whilst our ribald foes,<br/>Dressed in their own usurped authority,<br/>Sharpen their tongues on Henrietta's fame?<br/>It is enough! Thou lovest me no more!<br/>[WEEPS.]<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Oh, Henrietta!<br/><br/>[THEY TALK APART.]<br/><br/>COTTINGTON [TO LAUD]:<br/>Money we have none:<br/>And all the expedients of my Lord of Strafford<br/>Will scarcely meet the arrears.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Without delay<br/>An army must be sent into the north;<br/>Followed by a Commission of the Church,<br/>With amplest power to quench in fire and blood,<br/>And tears and terror, and the pity of hell,<br/>The intenser wrath of Heresy. God will give<br/>Victory; and victory over Scotland give<br/>The lion England tamed into our hands.<br/>That will lend power, and power bring gold.<br/><br/>COTTINGTON:<br/>Meanwhile<br/>We must begin first where your Grace leaves off.<br/>Gold must give power, or--<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>I am not averse<br/>From the assembling of a parliament.<br/>Strong actions and smooth words might teach them soon<br/>The lesson to obey. And are they not<br/>A bubble fashioned by the monarch's mouth,<br/>The birth of one light breath? If they serve no purpose,<br/>A word dissolves them.<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>The engine of parliaments<br/>Might be deferred until I can bring over<br/>The Irish regiments: they will serve to assure<br/>The issue of the war against the Scots.<br/>And, this game won--which if lost, all is lost--<br/>Gather these chosen leaders of the rebels,<br/>And call them, if you will, a parliament.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Oh, be our feet still tardy to shed blood.<br/>Guilty though it may be! I would still spare<br/>The stubborn country of my birth, and ward<br/>From countenances which I loved in youth<br/>The wrathful Church's lacerating hand.<br/>[TO LAUD.]<br/>Have you o'erlooked the other articles?<br/><br/>[ENTER ARCHY.]<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Hazlerig, Hampden, Pym, young Harry Vane,<br/>Cromwell, and other rebels of less note,<br/>Intend to sail with the next favouring wind<br/>For the Plantations.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Where they think to found<br/>A commonwealth like Gonzalo's in the play,<br/>Gynaecocoenic and pantisocratic.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>What's that, sirrah?<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>New devil's politics.<br/>Hell is the pattern of all commonwealths:<br/>Lucifer was the first republican.<br/>Will you hear Merlin's prophecy, how three<br/>'In one brainless skull, when the whitethorn is full,<br/>Shall sail round the world, and come back again:<br/>Shall sail round the world in a brainless skull,<br/>And come back again when the moon is at full:'--<br/>When, in spite of the Church,<br/>They will hear homilies of whatever length<br/>Or form they please.<br/><br/>[COTTINGTON?]:<br/>So please your Majesty to sign this order<br/>For their detention.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>If your Majesty were tormented night and day by fever, gout,<br/>rheumatism, and stone, and asthma, etc., and you found these diseases<br/>had secretly entered into a conspiracy to abandon you, should you<br/>think it necessary to lay an embargo on the port by which they meant<br/>to dispeople your unquiet kingdom of man?<br/><br/>KING:<br/>If fear were made for kings, the Fool mocks wisely;<br/>But in this case--[WRITING]. Here, my lord, take the warrant,<br/>And see it duly executed forthwith.--<br/>That imp of malice and mockery shall be punished.<br/><br/>[EXEUNT ALL BUT KING, QUEEN, AND ARCHY.]<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Ay, I am the physician of whom Plato prophesied, who was to be accused<br/>by the confectioner before a jury of children, who found him guilty<br/>without waiting for the summing-up, and hanged him without benefit of<br/>clergy. Thus Baby Charles, and the Twelfth-night Queen of Hearts, and<br/>the overgrown schoolboy Cottington, and that little urchin Laud--who<br/>would reduce a verdict of 'guilty, death,' by famine, if it were<br/>impregnable by composition--all impannelled against poor Archy for<br/>presenting them bitter physic the last day of the holidays.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>Is the rain over, sirrah?<br/><br/>KING:<br/>When it rains<br/>And the sun shines, 'twill rain again to-morrow:<br/>And therefore never smile till you've done crying.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>But 'tis all over now: like the April anger of woman, the gentle sky<br/>has wept itself serene.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>What news abroad? how looks the world this morning?<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Gloriously as a grave covered with virgin flowers. There's a rainbow<br/>in the sky. Let your Majesty look at it, for<br/><br/>'A rainbow in the morning<br/>Is the shepherd's warning;'<br/><br/>and the flocks of which you are the pastor are scattered among the<br/>mountain-tops, where every drop of water is a flake of snow, and the<br/>breath of May pierces like a January blast.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>The sheep have mistaken the wolf for their shepherd, my poor boy; and<br/>the shepherd, the wolves for their watchdogs.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>But the rainbow was a good sign, Archy: it says that the waters of the<br/>deluge are gone, and can return no more.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Ay, the salt-water one: but that of tears and blood must yet come<br/>down, and that of fire follow, if there be any truth in lies.--The<br/>rainbow hung over the city with all its shops,...and churches, from<br/>north to south, like a bridge of congregated lightning pieced by the<br/>masonry of heaven--like a balance in which the angel that distributes<br/>the coming hour was weighing that heavy one whose poise is now felt in<br/>the lightest hearts, before it bows the proudest heads under the<br/>meanest feet.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>Who taught you this trash, sirrah?<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>A torn leaf out of an old book trampled in the dirt.--But for the<br/>rainbow. It moved as the sun moved, and...until the top of the<br/>Tower...of a cloud through its left-hand tip, and Lambeth Palace look<br/>as dark as a rock before the other. Methought I saw a crown figured<br/>upon one tip, and a mitre on the other. So, as I had heard treasures<br/>were found where the rainbow quenches its points upon the earth, I set<br/>off, and at the Tower-- But I shall not tell your Majesty what I found<br/>close to the closet-window on which the rainbow had glimmered.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Speak: I will make my Fool my conscience.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Then conscience is a fool.--I saw there a cat caught in a rat-trap. I<br/>heard the rats squeak behind the wainscots: it seemed to me that the<br/>very mice were consulting on the manner of her death.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>Archy is shrewd and bitter.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Like the season,<br/>So blow the winds.--But at the other end of the rainbow, where the<br/>gray rain was tempered along the grass and leaves by a tender<br/>interfusion of violet and gold in the meadows beyond Lambeth, what<br/>think you that I found instead of a mitre?<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Vane's wits perhaps.<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>Something as vain. I saw a gross vapour hovering in a stinking ditch<br/>over the carcass of a dead ass, some rotten rags, and broken<br/>dishes--the wrecks of what once administered to the stuffing-out and<br/>the ornament of a worm of worms. His Grace of Canterbury expects to<br/>enter the New Jerusalem some Palm Sunday in triumph on the ghost of<br/>this ass.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>Enough, enough! Go desire Lady Jane<br/>She place my lute, together with the music<br/>Mari received last week from Italy,<br/>In my boudoir, and--<br/><br/>[EXIT ARCHY.]<br/><br/>KING:<br/>I'll go in.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>MY beloved lord,<br/>Have you not noted that the Fool of late<br/>Has lost his careless mirth, and that his words<br/>Sound like the echoes of our saddest fears?<br/>What can it mean? I should be loth to think<br/>Some factious slave had tutored him.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Oh, no!<br/>He is but Occasion's pupil. Partly 'tis<br/>That our minds piece the vacant intervals<br/>Of his wild words with their own fashioning,--<br/>As in the imagery of summer clouds,<br/>Or coals of the winter fire, idlers find<br/>The perfect shadows of their teeming thoughts:<br/>And partly, that the terrors of the time<br/>Are sown by wandering Rumour in all spirits;<br/>And in the lightest and the least, may best<br/>Be seen the current of the coming wind.<br/><br/>QUEEN:<br/>Your brain is overwrought with these deep thoughts.<br/>Come, I will sing to you; let us go try<br/>These airs from Italy; and, as we pass<br/>The gallery, we'll decide where that Correggio<br/>Shall hang--the Virgin Mother<br/>With her child, born the King of heaven and earth,<br/>Whose reign is men's salvation. And you shall see<br/>A cradled miniature of yourself asleep,<br/>Stamped on the heart by never-erring love;<br/>Liker than any Vandyke ever made,<br/>A pattern to the unborn age of thee,<br/>Over whose sweet beauty I have wept for joy<br/>A thousand times, and now should weep for sorrow,<br/>Did I not think that after we were dead<br/>Our fortunes would spring high in him, and that<br/>The cares we waste upon our heavy crown<br/>Would make it light and glorious as a wreath<br/>Of Heaven's beams for his dear innocent brow.<br/><br/>KING:<br/>Dear Henrietta!<br/><br/>SCENE 3:<br/>THE STAR CHAMBER.<br/>LAUD, JUXON, STRAFFORD, AND OTHERS, AS JUDGES.<br/>PRYNNE AS A PRISONER, AND THEN BASTWICK.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Bring forth the prisoner Bastwick: let the clerk<br/>Recite his sentence.<br/><br/>CLERK:<br/>'That he pay five thousand<br/>Pounds to the king, lose both his ears, be branded<br/>With red-hot iron on the cheek and forehead,<br/>And be imprisoned within Lancaster Castle<br/>During the pleasure of the Court.'<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Prisoner,<br/>If you have aught to say wherefore this sentence<br/>Should not be put into effect, now speak.<br/><br/>JUXON:<br/>If you have aught to plead in mitigation,<br/>Speak.<br/><br/>BASTWICK:<br/>Thus, my lords. If, like the prelates, I<br/>Were an invader of the royal power<br/>A public scorner of the word of God,<br/>Profane, idolatrous, popish, superstitious,<br/>Impious in heart and in tyrannic act,<br/>Void of wit, honesty, and temperance;<br/>If Satan were my lord, as theirs,--our God<br/>Pattern of all I should avoid to do;<br/>Were I an enemy of my God and King<br/>And of good men, as ye are;--I should merit<br/>Your fearful state and gilt prosperity,<br/>Which, when ye wake from the last sleep, shall turn<br/>To cowls and robes of everlasting fire.<br/>But, as I am, I bid ye grudge me not<br/>The only earthly favour ye can yield,<br/>Or I think worth acceptance at your hands,--<br/>Scorn, mutilation, and imprisonment.<br/>even as my Master did,<br/>Until Heaven's kingdom shall descend on earth,<br/>Or earth be like a shadow in the light<br/>Of Heaven absorbed--some few tumultuous years<br/>Will pass, and leave no wreck of what opposes<br/>His will whose will is power.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Officer, take the prisoner from the bar,<br/>And be his tongue slit for his insolence.<br/><br/>BASTWICK:<br/>While this hand holds a pen--<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Be his hands--<br/><br/>JUXON:<br/>Stop!<br/>Forbear, my lord! The tongue, which now can speak<br/>No terror, would interpret, being dumb,<br/>Heaven's thunder to our harm;...<br/>And hands, which now write only their own shame,<br/>With bleeding stumps might sign our blood away.<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Much more such 'mercy' among men would be,<br/>Did all the ministers of Heaven's revenge<br/>Flinch thus from earthly retribution. I<br/>Could suffer what I would inflict.<br/>[EXIT BASTWICK GUARDED.]<br/>Bring up<br/>The Lord Bishop of Lincoln.--<br/>[TO STRATFORD.]<br/>Know you not<br/>That, in distraining for ten thousand pounds<br/>Upon his books and furniture at Lincoln,<br/>Were found these scandalous and seditious letters<br/>Sent from one Osbaldistone, who is fled?<br/>I speak it not as touching this poor person;<br/>But of the office which should make it holy,<br/>Were it as vile as it was ever spotless.<br/>Mark too, my lord, that this expression strikes<br/>His Majesty, if I misinterpret not.<br/><br/>[ENTER BISHOP WILLIAMS GUARDED.]<br/><br/>STRAFFORD:<br/>'Twere politic and just that Williams taste<br/>The bitter fruit of his connection with<br/>The schismatics. But you, my Lord Archbishop,<br/>Who owed your first promotion to his favour,<br/>Who grew beneath his smile--<br/><br/>LAUD:<br/>Would therefore beg<br/>The office of his judge from this High Court,--<br/>That it shall seem, even as it is, that I,<br/>In my assumption of this sacred robe,<br/>Have put aside all worldly preference,<br/>All sense of all distinction of all persons,<br/>All thoughts but of the service of the Church.--<br/>Bishop of Lincoln!<br/><br/>WILLIAMS:<br/>Peace, proud hierarch!<br/>I know my sentence, and I own it just.<br/>Thou wilt repay me less than I deserve,<br/>In stretching to the utmost<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>SCENE 4:<br/>HAMPDEN, PYM, CROMWELL, HIS DAUGHTER, AND YOUNG SIR HARRY VANE.<br/><br/>HAMPDEN:<br/>England, farewell! thou, who hast been my cradle,<br/>Shalt never be my dungeon or my grave!<br/>I held what I inherited in thee<br/>As pawn for that inheritance of freedom<br/>Which thou hast sold for thy despoiler's smile:<br/>How can I call thee England, or my country?--<br/>Does the wind hold?<br/><br/>VANE:<br/>The vanes sit steady<br/>Upon the Abbey towers. The silver lightnings<br/>Of the evening star, spite of the city's smoke,<br/>Tell that the north wind reigns in the upper air.<br/>Mark too that flock of fleecy-winged clouds<br/>Sailing athwart St. Margaret's.<br/><br/>HAMPDEN:<br/>Hail, fleet herald<br/>Of tempest! that rude pilot who shall guide<br/>Hearts free as his, to realms as pure as thee,<br/>Beyond the shot of tyranny,<br/>Beyond the webs of that swoln spider...<br/>Beyond the curses, calumnies, and<br/>Of atheist priests! ... And thou<br/>Fair star, whose beam lies on the wide Atlantic,<br/>Athwart its zones of tempest and of calm,<br/>Bright as the path to a beloved home<br/>Oh, light us to the isles of the evening land!<br/>Like floating Edens cradled in the glimmer<br/>Of sunset, through the distant mist of years<br/>Touched by departing hope, they gleam! lone regions,<br/>Where Power's poor dupes and victims yet have never<br/>Propitiated the savage fear of kings<br/>With purest blood of noblest hearts; whose dew<br/>Is yet unstained with tears of those who wake<br/>To weep each day the wrongs on which it dawns;<br/>Whose sacred silent air owns yet no echo<br/>Of formal blasphemies; nor impious rites<br/>Wrest man's free worship, from the God who loves,<br/>To the poor worm who envies us His love!<br/>Receive, thou young ... of Paradise.<br/>These exiles from the old and sinful world!<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>This glorious clime, this firmament, whose lights<br/>Dart mitigated influence through their veil<br/>Of pale blue atmosphere; whose tears keep green<br/>The pavement of this moist all-feeding earth;<br/>This vaporous horizon, whose dim round<br/>Is bastioned by the circumfluous sea,<br/>Repelling invasion from the sacred towers,<br/>Presses upon me like a dungeon's grate,<br/>A low dark roof, a damp and narrow wall.<br/>The boundless universe<br/>Becomes a cell too narrow for the soul<br/>That owns no master; while the loathliest ward<br/>Of this wide prison, England, is a nest<br/>Of cradling peace built on the mountain tops,--<br/>To which the eagle spirits of the free,<br/>Which range through heaven and earth, and scorn the storm<br/>Of time, and gaze upon the light of truth,<br/>Return to brood on thoughts that cannot die<br/>And cannot be repelled.<br/>Like eaglets floating in the heaven of time,<br/>They soar above their quarry, and shall stoop<br/>Through palaces and temples thunderproof.<br/><br/>SCENE 5:<br/><br/>ARCHY:<br/>I'll go live under the ivy that overgrows the terrace, and count the<br/>tears shed on its old  as the  plays the song of<br/><br/>'A widow bird sate mourning<br/>Upon a wintry bough.'<br/>[SINGS]<br/>Heigho! the lark and the owl!<br/>One flies the morning, and one lulls the night:--<br/>Only the nightingale, poor fond soul,<br/>Sings like the fool through darkness and light.<br/><br/>'A widow bird sate mourning for her love<br/>Upon a wintry bough;<br/>The frozen wind crept on above,<br/>The freezing stream below.<br/><br/>There was no leaf upon the forest bare.<br/>No flower upon the ground,<br/>And little motion in the air<br/>Except the mill-wheel's sound.'
