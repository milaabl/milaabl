# üíÆ Epistle From Mr. Murray to Dr. Polidori by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
    DEAR Doctor, I have read your play,<br/>Which is a good one in its way,--<br/>Purges the eyes, and moves the bowels,<br/>And drenches handkerchiefs like towels<br/>With tears, that, in a flux of grief,<br/>Afford hysterical relief<br/>To shattered nerves and quickened pulses,<br/>Which your catastrophe convulses.<br/><br/>  I like your moral and machinery;<br/>Your plot, too, has such scope for Scenery!<br/>Your dialogue is apt and smart;<br/>The play's concoction full of art;<br/>Your hero raves, your heroine cries,<br/>All stab, and every body dies.<br/>In short, your tragedy would be<br/>The very thing to hear and see:<br/>And for a piece of publication,<br/>If I decline on this occasion,<br/>It is not that I am not sensible<br/>To merits in themselves ostensible,<br/>But--and I grieve to speak it--plays<br/>Are drugs--mere drugs, Sir--now-a-days.<br/>I had a heavy loss by _Manuel_--<br/>Too lucky if it prove not annual,--<br/>And Sotheby, with his _Orestes_,<br/>(Which, by the way, the old Bore's best is),<br/>Has lain so very long on hand,<br/>That I despair of all demand;<br/>I've advertised, but see my books,<br/>Or only watch my Shopman's looks;--<br/>Still _Ivan_, _Ina_, and such lumber,<br/>My back-shop glut, my shelves encumber.<br/><br/>There's Byron too, who once did better,<br/>Has sent me, folded in a letter,<br/>A sort of--it's no more a drama<br/>Than _Darnley_, _Ivan_, or _Kehama_;<br/>So altered since last year his pen is,<br/>I think he's lost his wits at Venice.<br/><br/>In short, Sir, what with one and t' other,<br/>I dare not venture on another.<br/>I write in haste; excuse each blunder;<br/>The Coaches through the street so thunder!<br/>My room's so full--we've Gifford here<br/>Reading MS., with Hookham Frere,<br/>Pronouncing on the nouns and particles,<br/>Of some of our forthcoming Articles.<br/><br/>  The _Quarterly_--Ah, Sir, if you<br/>Had but the Genius to review!--<br/>A smart Critique upon St. Helena,<br/>Or if you only would but tell in a<br/>Short compass what--but to resume;<br/>As I was saying, Sir, the Room--<br/>The Room's so full of wits and bards,<br/>Crabbes, Campbells, Crokers, Freres, and Wards<br/>And others, neither bards nor wits:<br/>My humble tenement admits<br/>All persons in the dress of Gent.,<br/>From Mr. Hammond to Dog Dent.<br/><br/>  A party dines with me to-day,<br/>All clever men, who make their way:<br/>Crabbe, Malcolm, Hamilton, and Chantrey,<br/>Are all partakers of my pantry.<br/>They're at this moment in discussion<br/>On poor De Sta√´l's late dissolution.<br/>Her book, they say, was in advance--<br/>Pray Heaven, she tell the truth of France!<br/>'T is said she certainly was married<br/>To Rocca, and had twice miscarried,<br/>No--not miscarried, I opine,--<br/>But brought to bed at forty-nine.<br/>Some say she died a Papist; some<br/>Are of opinion that's a Hum;<br/>I don't know that--the fellows Schlegel,<br/>Are very likely to inveigle<br/>A dying person in compunction<br/>To try th' extremity of Unction.<br/>But peace be with her! for a woman<br/>Her talents surely were uncommon,<br/>Her Publisher (and Public too)<br/>The hour of her demise may rue--<br/>For never more within his shop he--<br/>Pray--was not she interred at Coppet?<br/>Thus run our time and tongues away;--<br/>But, to return, Sir, to your play:<br/>Sorry, Sir, but I cannot deal,<br/>Unless 't were acted by O'Neill.<br/>My hands are full--my head so busy,<br/>I'm almost dead--and always dizzy;<br/>And so, with endless truth and hurry,<br/>Dear Doctor, I am yours,<br/>            JOHN MURRAY.
