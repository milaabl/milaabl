# üíÆ Eloisa to Abelard. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    In these deep solitudes and awful cells,<br/>Where heavenly-pensive Contemplation dwells,<br/>And ever-musing Melancholy reigns,<br/>What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?<br/>Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?<br/>Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?<br/>Yet, yet I love!--From Abelard it came,<br/>And Eloisa yet must kiss the name.<br/><br/>Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,<br/>Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd:<br/>Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise<br/>Where, mix'd with God's, his loved idea lies:<br/>Oh write it not, my hand!--the name appears<br/>Already written--wash it out, my tears!<br/>In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,<br/>Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.<br/><br/>Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains<br/>Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:<br/>Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;<br/>Ye grots and caverns, shagg'd with horrid thorn!<br/>Shrines! where their vigils pale-eyed virgins keep,<br/>And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!<br/>Though cold like you, unmoved and silent grown,<br/>I have not yet forgot myself to stone.<br/>All is not Heaven's while Abelard has part,<br/>Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;<br/>Nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,<br/>Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain.<br/><br/>Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,<br/>That well-known name awakens all my woes.<br/>Oh, name for ever sad! for ever dear!<br/>Still breathed in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.<br/>I tremble too, where'er my own I find,<br/>Some dire misfortune follows close behind.<br/>Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,<br/>Led through a sad variety of woe;<br/>Now warm in love, now withering in my bloom,<br/>Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!<br/>There stern religion quench'd the unwilling flame,<br/>There died the best of passions, Love and Fame.<br/><br/>Yet write, oh! write me all, that I may join<br/>Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.<br/>Nor foes nor fortune take this power away;<br/>And is my Abelard less kind than they?<br/>Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,<br/>Love but demands what else were shed in prayer;<br/>No happier task these faded eyes pursue;<br/>To read and weep is all they now can do.<br/><br/>Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;<br/>Ah, more than share it, give me all thy grief!<br/>Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,<br/>Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;<br/>They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,<br/>Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;<br/>The virgin's wish without her fears impart,<br/>Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,<br/>Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,<br/>And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.<br/><br/>Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,<br/>When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;<br/>My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,<br/>Some emanation of the all-beauteous Mind.<br/>Those smiling eyes, attempering every ray,<br/>Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.<br/>Guiltless I gazed; Heaven listen'd while you sung;<br/>And truths divine came mended from that tongue.<br/>From lips like those, what precept fail'd to move?<br/>Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love:<br/>Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,<br/>Nor wish'd an angel whom I loved a man.<br/>Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;<br/>Nor envy them that heaven I lose for thee.<br/><br/>How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,<br/>Curse on all laws but those which Love has made!<br/>Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,<br/>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.<br/>Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,<br/>August her deed, and sacred be her fame;<br/>Before true passion all those views remove;<br/>Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?<br/>The jealous god, when we profane his fires,<br/>Those restless passions in revenge inspires,<br/>And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,<br/>Who seek in love for aught but love alone.<br/>Should at my feet the world's great master fall,<br/>Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn them all:<br/>Not C√¶sar's empress would I deign to prove;<br/>No, make me mistress to the man I love;<br/>If there be yet another name more free,<br/>More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!<br/>Oh, happy state! when souls each other draw,<br/>When love is liberty, and nature law:<br/>All then is full, possessing and possess'd,<br/>No craving void left aching in the breast:<br/>Even thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,<br/>And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.<br/>This, sure, is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)<br/>And once the lot of Abelard and me.<br/><br/>Alas, how changed! what sudden horrors rise!<br/>A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!<br/>Where, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,<br/>Her poniard, had opposed the dire command.<br/>Barbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;<br/>The crime was common, common be the pain.<br/>I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,<br/>Let tears and burning blushes speak the rest.<br/><br/>Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,<br/>When victims at yon altar's foot we lay?<br/>Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,<br/>When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?<br/>As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,<br/>The shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale:<br/>Heaven scarce believed the conquest it survey'd,<br/>And saints with wonder heard the vows I made.<br/>Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,<br/>Not on the cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:<br/>Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,<br/>And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.<br/>Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;<br/>Those still at least are left thee to bestow.<br/>Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie,<br/>Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,<br/>Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;<br/>Give all thou canst--and let me dream the rest.<br/>Ah, no! instruct me other joys to prize,<br/>With other beauties charm my partial eyes,<br/>Full in my view set all the bright abode,<br/>And make my soul quit Abelard for God.<br/><br/>Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,<br/>Plants of thy hand, and children of thy prayer.<br/>From the false world in early youth they fled,<br/>By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.<br/>You raised these hallow'd walls; the desert smiled,<br/>And Paradise was open'd in the wild.<br/>No weeping orphan saw his father's stores<br/>Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;<br/>No silver saints, by dying misers given,<br/>Here bribed the rage of ill-requited Heaven:<br/>But such plain roofs as Piety could raise,<br/>And only vocal with the Maker's praise.<br/>In these lone walls, (their day's eternal bound)<br/>These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,<br/>Where awful arches make a noonday night,<br/>And the dim windows shed a solemn light;<br/>Thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray,<br/>And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.<br/>But now no face divine contentment wears,<br/>'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.<br/>See how the force of others' prayers I try,<br/>(Oh pious fraud of amorous charity!)<br/>But why should I on others' prayers depend?<br/>Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!<br/>Ah, let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,<br/>And all those tender names in one--thy love!<br/>The darksome pines that, o'er yon rocks reclined,<br/>Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,<br/>The wandering streams that shine between the hills,<br/>The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,<br/>The dying gales that pant upon the trees,<br/>The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;<br/>No more these scenes my meditation aid,<br/>Or lull to rest the visionary maid.<br/>But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,<br/>Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,<br/>Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws<br/>A death-like silence, and a dread repose:<br/>Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,<br/>Shades every flower, and darkens every green,<br/>Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,<br/>And breathes a browner horror on the woods.<br/><br/>Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;<br/>Sad proof how well a lover can obey!<br/>Death, only death, can break the lasting chain;<br/>And here, even then, shall my cold dust remain;<br/>Here all its frailties, all its flames resign,<br/>And wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.<br/><br/>Ah, wretch! believed the spouse of God in vain,<br/>Confess'd within the slave of love and man.<br/>Assist me, Heaven! but whence arose that prayer?<br/>Sprung it from piety, or from despair?<br/>Even here, where frozen chastity retires,<br/>Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.<br/>I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;<br/>I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;<br/>I view my crime, but kindle at the view,<br/>Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;<br/>Now turn'd to Heaven, I weep my past offence,<br/>Now think of thee, and curse my innocence.<br/>Of all affliction taught a lover yet,<br/>'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!<br/>How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,<br/>And love the offender, yet detest the offence?<br/>How the dear object from the crime remove,<br/>Or how distinguish penitence from love?<br/>Unequal task! a passion to resign,<br/>For hearts so touch'd, so pierced, so lost as mine.<br/>Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,<br/>How often must it love, how often hate!<br/>How often hope, despair, resent, regret,<br/>Conceal, disdain,--do all things but forget!<br/>But let Heaven seize it, all at once 'tis fired;<br/>Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspired!<br/>Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,<br/>Renounce my love, my life, myself--and you.<br/>Fill my fond heart with God alone, for He<br/>Alone can rival, can succeed to thee.<br/><br/>How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!<br/>The world forgetting, by the world forgot:<br/>Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br/>Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd;<br/>Labour and rest, that equal periods keep;<br/>'Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;'<br/>Desires composed, affections ever even;<br/>Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to heaven.<br/>Grace shines around her with serenest beams,<br/>And whispering angels prompt her golden dreams.<br/>For her the unfading rose of Eden blooms,<br/>And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes;<br/>For her the spouse prepares the bridal ring,<br/>For her white virgins hymeneals sing,<br/>To sounds of heavenly harps she dies away,<br/>And melts in visions of eternal day.<br/><br/>Far other dreams my erring soul employ,<br/>Far other raptures, of unholy joy:<br/>When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,<br/>Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,<br/>Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,<br/>All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.<br/>O curst, dear horrors of all-conscious night!<br/>How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!<br/>Provoking demons all restraint remove,<br/>And stir within me every source of love.<br/>I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,<br/>And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.<br/>I wake:--no more I hear, no more I view,<br/>The phantom flies me, as unkind as you.<br/>I call aloud; it hears not what I say:<br/>I stretch my empty arms; it glides away.<br/>To dream once more I close my willing eyes;<br/>Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!<br/>Alas, no more! methinks we wandering go<br/>Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,<br/>Where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps,<br/>And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.<br/>Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;<br/>Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.<br/>I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,<br/>And wake to all the griefs I left behind.<br/><br/>For thee the Fates, severely kind, ordain<br/>A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;<br/>Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose;<br/>No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.<br/>Still as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,<br/>Or moving spirit bade the waters flow;<br/>Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven,<br/>And mild as opening gleams of promised heaven.<br/><br/>Come, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?<br/>The torch of Venus burns not for the dead.<br/>Nature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;<br/>Even thou art cold--yet Eloisa loves.<br/>Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn<br/>To light the dead, and warm the unfruitful urn.<br/><br/>What scenes appear where'er I turn my view?<br/>The dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,<br/>Rise in the grove, before the altar rise,<br/>Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.<br/>I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,<br/>Thy image steals between my God and me,<br/>Thy voice I seem in every hymn to hear,<br/>With every bead I drop too soft a tear.<br/>When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,<br/>And swelling organs lift the rising soul,<br/>One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,<br/>Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:<br/>In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,<br/>While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.<br/><br/>While prostrate here in humble grief I lie,<br/>Kind, virtuous drops just gathering in my eye,<br/>While praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,<br/>And dawning grace is opening on my soul:<br/>Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!<br/>Oppose thyself to heaven; dispute my heart;<br/>Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes<br/>Blot out each bright idea of the skies;<br/>Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;<br/>Take back my fruitless penitence and prayers;<br/>Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;<br/>Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God!<br/><br/>No, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;<br/>Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!<br/>Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me,<br/>Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee!<br/>Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;<br/>Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.<br/>Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view)<br/>Long loved, adored ideas, all adieu!<br/>O Grace serene! O Virtue heavenly fair!<br/>Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!<br/>Fresh blooming Hope, gay daughter of the sky!<br/>And Faith, our early immortality!<br/>Enter, each mild, each amicable guest;<br/>Receive, and wrap me in eternal rest!<br/><br/>See in her cell sad Eloisa spread,<br/>Propp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.<br/>In each low wind methinks a spirit calls,<br/>And more than echoes talk along the walls.<br/>Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,<br/>From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.<br/>'Come, sister, come!' (it said, or seem'd to say)<br/>'Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!<br/>Once like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,<br/>Love's victim then, though now a sainted maid:<br/>But all is calm in this eternal sleep;<br/>Here Grief forgets to groan, and Love to weep,<br/>Even Superstition loses every fear:<br/>For God, not man, absolves our frailties here.'<br/><br/>I come, I come! prepare your roseate bowers,<br/>Celestial palms, and ever-blooming flowers.<br/>Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go,<br/>Where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow:<br/>Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,<br/>And smooth my passage to the realms of day;<br/>See my lips tremble, and my eyeballs roll,<br/>Suck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!<br/>Ah, no!--in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,<br/>The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,<br/>Present the cross before my lifted eye,<br/>Teach me at once, and learn of me to die.<br/>Ah, then thy once-loved Eloisa see!<br/>It will be then no crime to gaze on me.<br/>See from my cheek the transient roses fly!<br/>See the last sparkle languish in my eye!<br/>Till every motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;<br/>And even my Abelard be loved no more.<br/>O Death all-eloquent! you only prove<br/>What dust we doat on when 'tis man we love.<br/><br/>Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,<br/>(That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy!)<br/>In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,<br/>Bright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,<br/>From opening skies may streaming glories shine,<br/>And saints embrace thee with a love like mine.<br/><br/>May one kind grave unite each hapless name,<br/>And graft my love immortal on thy fame!<br/>Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,<br/>When this rebellious heart shall beat no more;<br/>If ever chance two wandering lovers brings<br/>To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,<br/>O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,<br/>And drink the falling tears each other sheds;<br/>Then sadly say,--with mutual pity moved,<br/>'Oh, may we never love as these have loved!'<br/>From the full choir when loud hosannas rise,<br/>And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,<br/>Amid that scene, if some relenting eye<br/>Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie,<br/>Devotion's self shall steal a thought from heaven,<br/>One human tear shall drop, and be forgiven.<br/>And sure, if Fate some future bard shall join<br/>In sad similitude of griefs to mine,<br/>Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,<br/>And image charms he must behold no more;<br/>Such if there be, who love so long, so well,<br/>Let him our sad, our tender story tell;<br/>The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;<br/>He best can paint them who shall feel them most.
