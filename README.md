# üíÆ Street Cries by *Sidney Lanier*

<p>
    Oft seems the Time a market-town<br/>Where many merchant-spirits meet<br/>Who up and down and up and down<br/>Cry out along the street<br/><br/>Their needs, as wares; one THUS, one SO:<br/>Till all the ways are full of sound:<br/>-- But still come rain, and sun, and snow,<br/>And still the world goes round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I. Remonstrance.<br/><br/><br/>"Opinion, let me alone: I am not thine.<br/>Prim Creed, with categoric point, forbear<br/>To feature me my Lord by rule and line.<br/>Thou canst not measure Mistress Nature's hair,<br/>Not one sweet inch: nay, if thy sight is sharp,<br/>Would'st count the strings upon an angel's harp?<br/>Forbear, forbear.<br/><br/>"Oh let me love my Lord more fathom deep<br/>Than there is line to sound with: let me love<br/>My fellow not as men that mandates keep:<br/>Yea, all that's lovable, below, above,<br/>That let me love by heart, by heart, because<br/>(Free from the penal pressure of the laws)<br/>I find it fair.<br/><br/>"The tears I weep by day and bitter night,<br/>Opinion! for thy sole salt vintage fall.<br/>-- As morn by morn I rise with fresh delight,<br/>Time through my casement cheerily doth call<br/>`Nature is new, 'tis birthday every day,<br/>Come feast with me, let no man say me nay,<br/>Whate'er befall.'<br/><br/>"So fare I forth to feast: I sit beside<br/>Some brother bright: but, ere good-morrow's passed,<br/>Burly Opinion wedging in hath cried<br/>`Thou shalt not sit by us, to break thy fast,<br/>Save to our Rubric thou subscribe and swear --<br/>`Religion hath blue eyes and yellow hair:'<br/>She's Saxon, all.'<br/><br/>"Then, hard a-hungered for my brother's grace<br/>Till well-nigh fain to swear his folly's true,<br/>In sad dissent I turn my longing face<br/>To him that sits on the left: `Brother, -- with you?'<br/>-- `Nay, not with me, save thou subscribe and swear<br/>`Religion hath black eyes and raven hair:'<br/>Nought else is true.'<br/><br/>"Debarred of banquets that my heart could make<br/>With every man on every day of life,<br/>I homeward turn, my fires of pain to slake<br/>In deep endearments of a worshipped wife.<br/>`I love thee well, dear Love,' quoth she, `and yet<br/>Would that thy creed with mine completely met,<br/>As one, not two.'<br/><br/>"Assassin! Thief! Opinion, 'tis thy work.<br/>By Church, by throne, by hearth, by every good<br/>That's in the Town of Time, I see thee lurk,<br/>And e'er some shadow stays where thou hast stood.<br/>Thou hand'st sweet Socrates his hemlock sour;<br/>Thou sav'st Barabbas in that hideous hour,<br/>And stabb'st the good<br/><br/>"Deliverer Christ; thou rack'st the souls of men;<br/>Thou tossest girls to lions and boys to flames;<br/>Thou hew'st Crusader down by Saracen;<br/>Thou buildest closets full of secret shames;<br/>Indifferent cruel, thou dost blow the blaze<br/>Round Ridley or Servetus; all thy days<br/>Smell scorched; I would<br/><br/>"-- Thou base-born Accident of time and place --<br/>Bigot Pretender unto Judgment's throne --<br/>Bastard, that claimest with a cunning face<br/>Those rights the true, true Son of Man doth own<br/>By Love's authority -- thou Rebel cold<br/>At head of civil wars and quarrels old --<br/>Thou Knife on a throne --<br/><br/>"I would thou left'st me free, to live with love,<br/>And faith, that through the love of love doth find<br/>My Lord's dear presence in the stars above,<br/>The clods below, the flesh without, the mind<br/>Within, the bread, the tear, the smile.<br/>Opinion, damned Intriguer, gray with guile,<br/>Let me alone."<br/><br/>____<br/>Baltimore, 1878-9.<br/><br/><br/><br/>II. The Ship of Earth.<br/><br/><br/>"Thou Ship of Earth, with Death, and Birth, and Life, and Sex aboard,<br/>And fires of Desires burning hotly in the hold,<br/>I fear thee, O! I fear thee, for I hear the tongue and sword<br/>At battle on the deck, and the wild mutineers are bold!<br/><br/>"The dewdrop morn may fall from off the petal of the sky,<br/>But all the deck is wet with blood and stains the crystal red.<br/>A pilot, GOD, a pilot! for the helm is left awry,<br/>And the best sailors in the ship lie there among the dead!"<br/><br/>____<br/>Prattville, Alabama, 1868.<br/><br/><br/><br/>III. How Love Looked for Hell.<br/><br/><br/>"To heal his heart of long-time pain<br/>One day Prince Love for to travel was fain<br/>With Ministers Mind and Sense.<br/>`Now what to thee most strange may be?'<br/>Quoth Mind and Sense. `All things above,<br/>One curious thing I first would see --<br/>Hell,' quoth Love.<br/><br/>"Then Mind rode in and Sense rode out:<br/>They searched the ways of man about.<br/>First frightfully groaneth Sense.<br/>`'Tis here, 'tis here,' and spurreth in fear<br/>To the top of the hill that hangeth above<br/>And plucketh the Prince: `Come, come, 'tis here --'<br/>`Where?' quoth Love --<br/><br/>"`Not far, not far,' said shivering Sense<br/>As they rode on. `A short way hence,<br/>-- But seventy paces hence:<br/>Look, King, dost see where suddenly<br/>This road doth dip from the height above?<br/>Cold blew a mouldy wind by me'<br/>(`Cold?' quoth Love)<br/><br/>"`As I rode down, and the River was black,<br/>And yon-side, lo! an endless wrack<br/>And rabble of souls,' sighed Sense,<br/>`Their eyes upturned and begged and burned<br/>In brimstone lakes, and a Hand above<br/>Beat back the hands that upward yearned --'<br/>`Nay!' quoth Love --<br/><br/>"`Yea, yea, sweet Prince; thyself shalt see,<br/>Wilt thou but down this slope with me;<br/>'Tis palpable,' whispered Sense.<br/>-- At the foot of the hill a living rill<br/>Shone, and the lilies shone white above;<br/>`But now 'twas black, 'twas a river, this rill,'<br/>(`Black?' quoth Love)<br/><br/>"`Ay, black, but lo! the lilies grow,<br/>And yon-side where was woe, was woe,<br/>-- Where the rabble of souls,' cried Sense,<br/>`Did shrivel and turn and beg and burn,<br/>Thrust back in the brimstone from above --<br/>Is banked of violet, rose, and fern:'<br/>`How?' quoth Love:<br/><br/>"`For lakes of pain, yon pleasant plain<br/>Of woods and grass and yellow grain<br/>Doth ravish the soul and sense:<br/>And never a sigh beneath the sky,<br/>And folk that smile and gaze above --'<br/>`But saw'st thou here, with thine own eye,<br/>Hell?' quoth Love.<br/><br/>"`I saw true hell with mine own eye,<br/>True hell, or light hath told a lie,<br/>True, verily,' quoth stout Sense.<br/>Then Love rode round and searched the ground,<br/>The caves below, the hills above;<br/>`But I cannot find where thou hast found<br/>Hell,' quoth Love.<br/><br/>"There, while they stood in a green wood<br/>And marvelled still on Ill and Good,<br/>Came suddenly Minister Mind.<br/>`In the heart of sin doth hell begin:<br/>'Tis not below, 'tis not above,<br/>It lieth within, it lieth within:'<br/>(`Where?' quoth Love)<br/><br/>"`I saw a man sit by a corse;<br/>`Hell's in the murderer's breast: remorse!'<br/>Thus clamored his mind to his mind:<br/>Not fleshly dole is the sinner's goal,<br/>Hell's not below, nor yet above,<br/>'Tis fixed in the ever-damned soul --'<br/>`Fixed?' quoth Love --<br/><br/>"`Fixed: follow me, would'st thou but see:<br/>He weepeth under yon willow tree,<br/>Fast chained to his corse,' quoth Mind.<br/>Full soon they passed, for they rode fast,<br/>Where the piteous willow bent above.<br/>`Now shall I see at last, at last,<br/>Hell,' quoth Love.<br/><br/>"There when they came Mind suffered shame:<br/>`These be the same and not the same,'<br/>A-wondering whispered Mind.<br/>Lo, face by face two spirits pace<br/>Where the blissful willow waves above:<br/>One saith: `Do me a friendly grace --'<br/>(`Grace!' quoth Love)<br/><br/>"`Read me two Dreams that linger long,<br/>Dim as returns of old-time song<br/>That flicker about the mind.<br/>I dreamed (how deep in mortal sleep!)<br/>I struck thee dead, then stood above,<br/>With tears that none but dreamers weep;'<br/>`Dreams,' quoth Love;<br/><br/>"`In dreams, again, I plucked a flower<br/>That clung with pain and stung with power,<br/>Yea, nettled me, body and mind.'<br/>`'Twas the nettle of sin, 'twas medicine;<br/>No need nor seed of it here Above;<br/>In dreams of hate true loves begin.'<br/>`True,' quoth Love.<br/><br/>"`Now strange,' quoth Sense, and `Strange,' quoth Mind,<br/>`We saw it, and yet 'tis hard to find,<br/>-- But we saw it,' quoth Sense and Mind.<br/>Stretched on the ground, beautiful-crowned<br/>Of the piteous willow that wreathed above,<br/>`But I cannot find where ye have found<br/>Hell,' quoth Love."<br/><br/>____<br/>Baltimore, 1878-9.<br/><br/><br/><br/>IV. Tyranny.<br/><br/><br/>"Spring-germs, spring-germs,<br/>I charge you by your life, go back to death.<br/>This glebe is sick, this wind is foul of breath.<br/>Stay: feed the worms.<br/><br/>"Oh! every clod<br/>Is faint, and falters from the war of growth<br/>And crumbles in a dreary dust of sloth,<br/>Unploughed, untrod.<br/><br/>"What need, what need,<br/>To hide with flowers the curse upon the hills,<br/>Or sanctify the banks of sluggish rills<br/>Where vapors breed?<br/><br/>"And -- if needs must --<br/>Advance, O Summer-heats! upon the land,<br/>And bake the bloody mould to shards and sand<br/>And dust.<br/><br/>"Before your birth,<br/>Burn up, O Roses! with your dainty flame.<br/>Good Violets, sweet Violets, hide shame<br/>Below the earth.<br/><br/>"Ye silent Mills,<br/>Reject the bitter kindness of the moss.<br/>O Farms! protest if any tree emboss<br/>The barren hills.<br/><br/>"Young Trade is dead,<br/>And swart Work sullen sits in the hillside fern<br/>And folds his arms that find no bread to earn,<br/>And bows his head.<br/><br/>"Spring-germs, spring-germs,<br/>Albeit the towns have left you place to play,<br/>I charge you, sport not. Winter owns to-day,<br/>Stay: feed the worms."<br/><br/>____<br/>Prattville, Alabama, 1868.<br/><br/><br/><br/>V. Life and Song.<br/><br/><br/>"If life were caught by a clarionet,<br/>And a wild heart, throbbing in the reed,<br/>Should thrill its joy and trill its fret,<br/>And utter its heart in every deed,<br/><br/>"Then would this breathing clarionet<br/>Type what the poet fain would be;<br/>For none o' the singers ever yet<br/>Has wholly lived his minstrelsy,<br/><br/>"Or clearly sung his true, true thought,<br/>Or utterly bodied forth his life,<br/>Or out of life and song has wrought<br/>The perfect one of man and wife;<br/><br/>"Or lived and sung, that Life and Song<br/>Might each express the other's all,<br/>Careless if life or art were long<br/>Since both were one, to stand or fall:<br/><br/>"So that the wonder struck the crowd,<br/>Who shouted it about the land:<br/>`His song was only living aloud,<br/>His work, a singing with his hand!'"<br/><br/>____<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>VI. To Richard Wagner.<br/><br/><br/>"I saw a sky of stars that rolled in grime.<br/>All glory twinkled through some sweat of fight,<br/>From each tall chimney of the roaring time<br/>That shot his fire far up the sooty night<br/>Mixt fuels -- Labor's Right and Labor's Crime --<br/>Sent upward throb on throb of scarlet light<br/>Till huge hot blushes in the heavens blent<br/>With golden hues of Trade's high firmament.<br/><br/>"Fierce burned the furnaces; yet all seemed well,<br/>Hope dreamed rich music in the rattling mills.<br/>`Ye foundries, ye shall cast my church a bell,'<br/>Loud cried the Future from the farthest hills:<br/>`Ye groaning forces, crack me every shell<br/>Of customs, old constraints, and narrow ills;<br/>Thou, lithe Invention, wake and pry and guess,<br/>Till thy deft mind invents me Happiness.'<br/><br/>"And I beheld high scaffoldings of creeds<br/>Crumbling from round Religion's perfect Fane:<br/>And a vast noise of rights, wrongs, powers, needs,<br/>-- Cries of new Faiths that called `This Way is plain,'<br/>-- Grindings of upper against lower greeds --<br/>-- Fond sighs for old things, shouts for new, -- did reign<br/>Below that stream of golden fire that broke,<br/>Mottled with red, above the seas of smoke.<br/><br/>"Hark! Gay fanfares from halls of old Romance<br/>Strike through the clouds of clamor: who be these<br/>That, paired in rich processional, advance<br/>From darkness o'er the murk mad factories<br/>Into yon flaming road, and sink, strange Ministrants!<br/>Sheer down to earth, with many minstrelsies<br/>And motions fine, and mix about the scene<br/>And fill the Time with forms of ancient mien?<br/><br/>"Bright ladies and brave knights of Fatherland;<br/>Sad mariners, no harbor e'er may hold,<br/>A swan soft floating tow'rds a magic strand;<br/>Dim ghosts, of earth, air, water, fire, steel, gold,<br/>Wind, grief, and love; a lewd and lurking band<br/>Of Powers -- dark Conspiracy, Cunning cold,<br/>Gray Sorcery; magic cloaks and rings and rods;<br/>Valkyries, heroes, Rhinemaids, giants, gods!<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>"O Wagner, westward bring thy heavenly art,<br/>No trifler thou: Siegfried and Wotan be<br/>Names for big ballads of the modern heart.<br/>Thine ears hear deeper than thine eyes can see.<br/>Voice of the monstrous mill, the shouting mart,<br/>Not less of airy cloud and wave and tree,<br/>Thou, thou, if even to thyself unknown,<br/>Hast power to say the Time in terms of tone."<br/><br/>____<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>VII. A Song of Love.<br/><br/><br/>"Hey, rose, just born<br/>Twin to a thorn;<br/>Was't so with you, O Love and Scorn?<br/><br/>"Sweet eyes that smiled,<br/>Now wet and wild;<br/>O Eye and Tear -- mother and child.<br/><br/>"Well: Love and Pain<br/>Be kinsfolk twain:<br/>Yet would, Oh would I could love again."
