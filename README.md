<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot; or, Prologue to the Satires. by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    _P_. Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigued, I said,<br/>Tie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead.<br/>The Dog-star rages! nay, 'tis past a doubt,<br/>All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out:<br/>Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand,<br/>They rave, recite, and madden round the land.<br/><br/>What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?<br/>They pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide,<br/>By land, by water, they renew the charge,<br/>They stop the chariot, and they board the barge.<br/>No place is sacred, not the church is free,<br/>Even Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me:<br/>Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme,<br/>Happy! to catch me, just at dinner-time.<br/><br/>Is there a parson, much bemused in beer,<br/>A maudlin poetess, a rhyming peer,<br/>A clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross,<br/>Who pens a stanza, when he should engross?<br/>Is there, who, lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls<br/>With desperate charcoal round his darken'd walls?<br/>All fly to Twit'nam, and in humble strain<br/>Apply to me, to keep them mad or vain.<br/>Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws,<br/>Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause:<br/>Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope,<br/>And curses wit, and poetry, and Pope.<br/><br/>Friend to my life! (which did not you prolong,<br/>The world had wanted many an idle song)<br/>What drop or nostrum can this plague remove?<br/>Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love?<br/>A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped,<br/>If foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead.<br/>Seized and tied down to judge, how wretched I!<br/>Who can't be silent, and who will not lie:<br/>To laugh, were want of goodness and of grace,<br/>And to be grave, exceeds all power of face.<br/>I sit with sad civility, I read<br/>With honest anguish, and an aching head;<br/>And drop at last, but in unwilling ears,<br/>This saving counsel, 'Keep your piece nine years.'<br/><br/>'Nine years!' cries he, who high in Drury-lane,<br/>Lull'd by soft zephyrs through the broken pane,<br/>Rhymes ere he wakes, and prints before Term ends,<br/>Obliged by hunger, and request of friends:<br/>'The piece, you think, is incorrect? why take it,<br/>I'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it.'<br/><br/>Three things another's modest wishes bound,<br/>My friendship, and a prologue, and ten pound.<br/><br/>Pitholeon sends to me: 'You know his Grace,<br/>I want a patron; ask him for a place.'<br/>Pitholeon libell'd me--'But here's a letter<br/>Informs you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better.<br/>Dare you refuse him? Curll invites to dine,<br/>He'll write a journal, or he'll turn divine.'<br/><br/>Bless me! a packet.--''Tis a stranger sues,<br/>A virgin tragedy, an orphan Muse.'<br/>If I dislike it, 'Furies, death, and rage!'<br/>If I approve, 'Commend it to the stage.'<br/>There (thank my stars) my whole commission ends,<br/>The players and I are, luckily, no friends.<br/>Fired that the house reject him, ''Sdeath! I'll print it,<br/>And shame the fools--Your interest, sir, with Lintot.'<br/>Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much:<br/>'Not, sir, if you revise it, and retouch.'<br/>All my demurs but double his attacks;<br/>At last he whispers, 'Do; and we go snacks.'<br/>Glad of a quarrel, straight I clap the door:<br/>Sir, let me see your works and you no more.<br/><br/>'Tis sung, when Midas' ears began to spring<br/>(Midas, a sacred person and a king),<br/>His very minister who spied them first,<br/>(Some say his queen) was forced to speak, or burst.<br/>And is not mine, my friend, a sorer case,<br/>When every coxcomb perks them in my face?<br/><br/>_A_. Good friend, forbear! you deal in dangerous things.<br/>I'd never name queens, ministers, or kings;<br/>Keep close to ears, and those let asses prick,<br/>'Tis nothing----<br/><br/>_P_.     Nothing? if they bite and kick?<br/>Out with it, Dunciad! let the secret pass,<br/>That secret to each fool, that he's an ass:<br/>The truth once told (and wherefore should we lie?)<br/>The queen of Midas slept, and so may I.<br/><br/>You think this cruel? Take it for a rule,<br/>No creature smarts so little as a fool.<br/>Let peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break,<br/>Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crack:<br/>Pit, box, and gallery in convulsions hurl'd,<br/>Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world.<br/>Who shames a scribbler? break one cobweb through,<br/>He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew:<br/>Destroy his fib or sophistry, in vain,<br/>The creature's at his dirty work again,<br/>Throned in the centre of his thin designs,<br/>Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines!<br/>Whom have I hurt? has poet yet, or peer,<br/>Lost the arch'd eyebrow, or Parnassian sneer?<br/>And has not Colly still his lord, and whore?<br/>His butchers, Henley, his freemasons, Moore?<br/>Does not one table Bavius still admit?<br/>Still to one bishop, Philips seem a wit<br/>Still Sappho----<br/><br/>_A_.     Hold! for God-sake--you'll offend,<br/>No names--be calm--learn prudence of a friend:<br/>I too could write, and I am twice as tall;<br/>But foes like these----<br/><br/>_P_.          One flatterer's worse than all.<br/>Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right,<br/>It is the slaver kills, and not the bite.<br/>A fool quite angry is quite innocent:<br/>Alas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent.<br/><br/>One dedicates in high heroic prose,<br/>And ridicules beyond a hundred foes:<br/>One from all Grub-street will my fame defend,<br/>And, more abusive, calls himself my friend.<br/>This prints my letters, that expects a bribe,<br/>And others roar aloud, 'Subscribe, subscribe!'<br/><br/>There are, who to my person pay their court:<br/>I cough like Horace, and, though lean, am short,<br/>Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high,<br/>Such Ovid's nose, and, 'Sir! you have an eye'--<br/>Go on, obliging creatures! make me see<br/>All that disgraced my betters, met in me.<br/>Say for my comfort, languishing in bed,<br/>'Just so immortal Maro held his head:'<br/>And, when I die, be sure you let me know<br/>Great Homer died three thousand years ago.<br/><br/>Why did I write? what sin to me unknown<br/>Dipp'd me in ink, my parents', or my own?<br/>As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,<br/>I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.<br/>I left no calling for this idle trade,<br/>No duty broke, no father disobey'd.<br/>The Muse but served to ease some friend, not wife,<br/>To help me through this long disease, my life,<br/>To second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care,<br/>And teach the being you preserved to bear.<br/><br/>But why then publish? Granville the polite,<br/>And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write;<br/>Well-natured Garth inflamed with early praise,<br/>And Congreve loved, and Swift endured my lays;<br/>The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read,<br/>Even mitred Rochester would nod the head,<br/>And St John's self (great Dryden's friends before)<br/>With open arms received one poet more.<br/>Happy my studies, when by these approved!<br/>Happier their author, when by these beloved!<br/>From these the world will judge of men and books,<br/>Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cookes.<br/><br/>Soft were my numbers; who could take offence<br/>While pure description held the place of sense?<br/>Like gentle Fanny's was my flowery theme,<br/>'A painted mistress, or a purling stream.'<br/>Yet then did Gildon draw his venal quill;<br/>I wish'd the man a dinner, and sat still.<br/>Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret;<br/>I never answer'd--I was not in debt.<br/>If want provoked, or madness made them print,<br/>I waged no war with Bedlam or the Mint.<br/><br/>Did some more sober critic come abroad--<br/>If wrong, I smiled; if right, I kiss'd the rod.<br/>Pains, reading, study, are their just pretence,<br/>And all they want is spirit, taste, and sense.<br/>Commas and points they set exactly right,<br/>And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite.<br/>Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel graced these ribalds,<br/>From slashing Bentley down to piddling Tibbalds:<br/>Each wight, who reads not, and but scans and spells,<br/>Each word-catcher, that lives on syllables,<br/>Even such small critics some regard may claim,<br/>Preserved in Milton's or in Shakspeare's name.<br/>Pretty! in amber to observe the forms<br/>Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms!<br/>The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,<br/>But wonder how the devil they got there.<br/><br/>Were others angry--I excused them too;<br/>Well might they rage, I gave them but their due.<br/>A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find;<br/>But each man's secret standard in his mind,<br/>That casting-weight pride adds to emptiness,<br/>This, who can gratify for who can guess?<br/>The bard whom pilfer'd Pastorals renown,<br/>Who turns a Persian tale for half-a-crown,<br/>Just writes to make his barrenness appear,<br/>And strains from hard-bound brains eight lines a year;<br/>He who, still wanting, though he lives on theft,<br/>Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left:<br/>And he who, now to sense, now nonsense leaning,<br/>Means not, but blunders round about a meaning:<br/>And he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad,<br/>It is not poetry, but prose run mad:<br/>All these, my modest satire bade translate,<br/>And own'd that nine such poets made a Tate.<br/>How did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe!<br/>And swear, not Addison himself was safe.<br/><br/>Peace to all such! but were there one whose fires<br/>True genius kindles, and fair fame inspires;<br/>Blest with each talent and each art to please,<br/>And born to write, converse, and live with ease:<br/>Should such a man, too fond to rule alone,<br/>Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne,<br/>View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes,<br/>And hate for arts that caused himself to rise;<br/>Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,<br/>And, without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;<br/>Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,<br/>Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike;<br/>Alike reserved to blame, or to commend,<br/>A timorous foe, and a suspicious friend;<br/>Dreading e'en fools, by flatterers besieged,<br/>And so obliging, that he ne'er obliged;<br/>Like Cato, give his little senate laws,<br/>And sit attentive to his own applause;<br/>While wits and Templars every sentence raise,<br/>And wonder with a foolish face of praise--<br/>Who but must laugh, if such a man there be?<br/>Who would not weep, if Atticus were he?<br/><br/>What though my name stood rubric on the walls,<br/>Or plaster'd posts, with claps, in capitals?<br/>Or smoking forth, a hundred hawkers' load,<br/>On wings of winds came flying all abroad?<br/>I sought no homage from the race that write;<br/>I kept, like Asian monarchs, from their sight:<br/>Poems I heeded (now be-rhymed so long)<br/>No more than thou, great George! a birthday song.<br/>I ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days,<br/>To spread about the itch of verse and praise;<br/>Nor like a puppy, daggled through the town,<br/>To fetch and carry sing-song up and down;<br/>Nor at rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cried,<br/>With handkerchief and orange at my side;<br/>But sick of fops, and poetry, and prate,<br/>To Bufo left the whole Castalian state.<br/><br/>Proud as Apollo on his fork√®d hill,<br/>Sat full-blown Bufo, puff'd by every quill;<br/>Fed with soft dedication all day long,<br/>Horace and he went hand in hand in song.<br/>His library (where busts of poets dead<br/>And a true Pindar stood without a head)<br/>Received of wits an undistinguish'd race,<br/>Who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place:<br/>Much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat,<br/>And flatter'd every day, and some days eat:<br/>Till, grown more frugal in his riper days,<br/>He paid some bards with port, and some with praise,<br/>To some a dry rehearsal was assign'd,<br/>And others (harder still) he paid in kind.<br/>Dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh,<br/>Dryden alone escaped this judging eye:<br/>But still the great have kindness in reserve,<br/>He help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve.<br/><br/>May some choice patron bless each gray-goose quill!<br/>May every Bavius have his Bufo still!<br/>So when a statesman wants a day's defence,<br/>Or envy holds a whole week's war with sense,<br/>Or simple pride for flattery makes demands,<br/>May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands!<br/>Bless'd be the great! for those they take away,<br/>And those they left me; for they left me Gay;<br/>Left me to see neglected genius bloom,<br/>Neglected die, and tell it on his tomb:<br/>Of all thy blameless life, the sole return<br/>My verse, and Queensberry weeping o'er thy urn!<br/><br/>Oh let me live my own, and die so too!<br/>(To live and die is all I have to do:)<br/>Maintain a poet's dignity and ease,<br/>And see what friends, and read what books I please:<br/>Above a patron, though I condescend<br/>Sometimes to call a minister my friend.<br/>I was not born for courts or great affairs;<br/>I pay my debts, believe, and say my prayers;<br/>Can sleep without a poem in my head,<br/>Nor know if Dennis be alive or dead.<br/><br/>Why am I ask'd what next shall see the light?<br/>Heavens! was I born for nothing but to write?<br/>Has life no joys for me? or (to be grave)<br/>Have I no friend to serve, no soul to save?<br/>'I found him close with Swift--Indeed? no doubt<br/>(Cries prating Balbus) something will come out.'<br/>'Tis all in vain, deny it as I will.<br/>'No, such a genius never can lie still;'<br/>And then for mine obligingly mistakes<br/>The first lampoon Sir Will or Bubo makes.<br/>Poor guiltless I! and can I choose but smile,<br/>When every coxcomb knows me by my style?<br/><br/>Cursed be the verse, how well soe'er it flow,<br/>That tends to make one worthy man my foe,<br/>Give virtue scandal, innocence a fear,<br/>Or from the soft-eyed virgin steal a tear!<br/>But he who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace,<br/>Insults fallen worth, or beauty in distress,<br/>Who loves a lie, lame slander helps about,<br/>Who writes a libel, or who copies out:<br/>That fop, whose pride affects a patron's name,<br/>Yet, absent, wounds an author's honest fame:<br/>Who can your merit selfishly approve,<br/>And show the sense of it without the love;<br/>Who has the vanity to call you friend,<br/>Yet wants the honour, injured, to defend;<br/>Who tells whate'er you think, whate'er you say,<br/>And, if he lie not, must at least betray:<br/>Who to the dean, and silver bell can swear,<br/>And sees at Canons what was never there;<br/>Who reads, but--with a lust to misapply,<br/>Make satire a lampoon, and fiction, lie;<br/>A lash like mine no honest man shall dread,<br/>But all such babbling blockheads in his stead.<br/>Let Sporus tremble--<br/><br/>_A_.               What? that thing of silk,<br/>Sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk?<br/>Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel?<br/>Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?<br/><br/>_P_. Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings,<br/>This painted child of dirt, that stinks and stings;<br/>Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys,<br/>Yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'er enjoys;<br/>So well-bred spaniels civilly delight<br/>In mumbling of the game they dare not bite.<br/>Eternal smiles his emptiness betray,<br/>As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.<br/>Whether in florid impotence he speaks,<br/>And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks;<br/>Or at the ear of Eve, familiar toad!<br/>Half-froth, half-venom, spits himself abroad,<br/>In puns or politics, or tales, or lies,<br/>Or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies.<br/>His wit all see-saw, between that and this,<br/>Now high, now low, now master up, now miss,<br/>And he himself one vile antithesis.<br/>Amphibious thing! that, acting either part,<br/>The trifling head, or the corrupted heart,<br/>Fop at the toilet, flatterer at the board,<br/>Now trips a lady, and now struts a lord.<br/>Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have express'd,<br/>A cherub's face, a reptile all the rest,<br/>Beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust,<br/>Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust.<br/><br/>Not Fortune's worshipper, nor Fashion's fool,<br/>Not Lucre's madman, nor Ambition's tool,<br/>Not proud, nor servile; be one poet's praise,<br/>That, if he pleased, he pleased by manly ways:<br/>That flattery, even to kings, he held a shame,<br/>And thought a lie in verse or prose the same.<br/>That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,<br/>But stoop'd to Truth, and moralised his song:<br/>That not for Fame, but Virtue's better end,<br/>He stood the furious foe, the timid friend,<br/>The damning critic, half-approving wit,<br/>The coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit;<br/>Laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had,<br/>The dull, the proud, the wicked, and the mad;<br/>The distant threats of vengeance on his head,<br/>The blow unfelt, the tear he never shed;<br/>The tale revived, the lie so oft o'erthrown,<br/>Th' imputed trash, and dulness not his own;<br/>The morals blacken'd when the writings 'scape,<br/>The libell'd person, and the pictured shape;<br/>Abuse, on all he loved, or loved him, spread,<br/>A friend in exile, or a father dead;<br/>The whisper that, to greatness still too near,<br/>Perhaps yet vibrates on his sovereign's ear--<br/>Welcome for thee, fair Virtue! all the past:<br/>For thee, fair Virtue! welcome even the last!<br/><br/>_A_. But why insult the poor, affront the great?<br/><br/>_P_. A knave's a knave, to me, in every state:<br/>Alike my scorn, if he succeed or fail,<br/>Sporus at court, or Japhet in a jail,<br/>A hireling scribbler, or a hireling peer,<br/>Knight of the post corrupt, or of the shire;<br/>If on a pillory, or near a throne,<br/>He gain his prince's ear, or lose his own.<br/><br/>Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit,<br/>Sappho can tell you how this man was bit:<br/>This dreaded satirist Dennis will confess<br/>Foe to his pride, but friend to his distress:<br/>So humble, he has knock'd at Tibbald's door,<br/>Has drunk with Cibber, nay, has rhymed for Moore.<br/>Full ten years slander'd, did he once reply?<br/>Three thousand suns went down on Welsted's lie.<br/>To please a mistress one aspersed his life;<br/>He lash'd him not, but let her be his wife:<br/>Let Budgell charge low Grub-street on his quill,<br/>And write whate'er he pleased, except his will;<br/>Let the two Curlls of town and court abuse<br/>His father, mother, body, soul, and Muse.<br/>Yet why that father held it for a rule,<br/>It was a sin to call our neighbour fool:<br/>That harmless mother thought no wife a whore:<br/>Hear this, and spare his family, James Moore!<br/>Unspotted names, and memorable long!<br/>If there be force in virtue, or in song.<br/><br/>Of gentle blood (part shed in honour's cause,<br/>While yet in Britain honour had applause)<br/>Each parent sprung----<br/><br/>_A._         What fortune, pray?----<br/><br/>_P._                            Their own,<br/>And better got, than Bestia's from the throne.<br/>Born to no pride, inheriting no strife,<br/>Nor marrying discord in a noble wife,<br/>Stranger to civil and religious rage,<br/>The good man walk'd innoxious through his age.<br/>No courts he saw, no suits would ever try,<br/>Nor dared an oath, nor hazarded a lie.<br/>Unlearn'd, he knew no schoolman's subtle art,<br/>No language but the language of the heart.<br/>By nature honest, by experience wise,<br/>Healthy by temperance, and by exercise;<br/>His life, though long, to sickness pass'd unknown,<br/>His death was instant, and without a groan.<br/>O grant me thus to live, and thus to die!<br/>Who sprung from kings shall know less joy than I.<br/><br/>O friend! may each domestic bliss be thine!<br/>Be no unpleasing melancholy mine:<br/>Me, let the tender office long engage,<br/>To rock the cradle of reposing age,<br/>With lenient arts extend a mother's breath,<br/>Make languor smile, and smooth the bed of death,<br/>Explore the thought, explain the asking eye,<br/>And keep a while one parent from the sky!<br/>On cares like these if length of days attend,<br/>May Heaven, to bless those days, preserve my friend,<br/>Preserve him social, cheerful, and serene,<br/>And just as rich as when he served a Queen.<br/><br/>_A_. Whether that blessing be denied or given,<br/>Thus far was right, the rest belongs to Heaven.
