# üíÆ The Peace-Pipe by *Henry Wadsworth Longfellow*

<p>
    On the Mountains of the Prairie,<br/>On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,<br/>Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>He the Master of Life, descending,<br/>On the red crags of the quarry<br/>Stood erect, and called the nations,<br/>Called the tribes of men together.<br/>From his footprints flowed a river,<br/>Leaped into the light of morning,<br/>O'er the precipice plunging downward<br/>Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.<br/>And the Spirit, stooping earthward,<br/>With his finger on the meadow<br/>Traced a winding pathway for it,<br/>Saying to it, "Run in this way!"<br/>From the red stone of the quarry<br/>With his hand he broke a fragment,<br/>Moulded it into a pipe-head,<br/>Shaped and fashioned it with figures;<br/>From the margin of the river<br/>Took a long reed for a pipe-stem,<br/>With its dark green leaves upon it;<br/>Filled the pipe with bark of willow,<br/>With the bark of the red willow;<br/>Breathed upon the neighboring forest,<br/>Made its great boughs chafe together,<br/>Till in flame they burst and kindled;<br/>And erect upon the mountains,<br/>Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,<br/>As a signal to the nations.<br/>And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,<br/>Through the tranquil air of morning,<br/>First a single line of darkness,<br/>Then a denser, bluer vapor,<br/>Then a snow-white cloud unfolding,<br/>Like the tree-tops of the forest,<br/>Ever rising, rising, rising,<br/>Till it touched the top of heaven,<br/>Till it broke against the heaven,<br/>And rolled outward all around it.<br/>From the Vale of Tawasentha,<br/>From the Valley of Wyoming,<br/>From the groves of Tuscaloosa,<br/>From the far-off Rocky Mountains,<br/>From the Northern lakes and rivers<br/>All the tribes beheld the signal,<br/>Saw the distant smoke ascending,<br/>The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe.<br/>And the Prophets of the nations<br/>Said: "Behold it, the Pukwana!<br/>By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,<br/>Bending like a wand of willow,<br/>Waving like a hand that beckons,<br/>Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>Calls the tribes of men together,<br/>Calls the warriors to his council!"<br/>Down the rivers, o'er the prairies,<br/>Came the warriors of the nations,<br/>Came the Delawares and Mohawks,<br/>Came the Choctaws and Camanches,<br/>Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet,<br/>Came the Pawnees and Omahas,<br/>Came the Mandans and Dacotahs,<br/>Came the Hurons and Ojibways,<br/>All the warriors drawn together<br/>By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,<br/>To the Mountains of the Prairie,<br/>To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,<br/>And they stood there on the meadow,<br/>With their weapons and their war-gear,<br/>Painted like the leaves of Autumn,<br/>Painted like the sky of morning,<br/>Wildly glaring at each other;<br/>In their faces stem defiance,<br/>In their hearts the feuds of ages,<br/>The hereditary hatred,<br/>The ancestral thirst of vengeance.<br/>Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>The creator of the nations,<br/>Looked upon them with compassion,<br/>With paternal love and pity;<br/>Looked upon their wrath and wrangling<br/>But as quarrels among children,<br/>But as feuds and fights of children!<br/>Over them he stretched his right hand,<br/>To subdue their stubborn natures,<br/>To allay their thirst and fever,<br/>By the shadow of his right hand;<br/>Spake to them with voice majestic<br/>As the sound of far-off waters,<br/>Falling into deep abysses,<br/>Warning, chiding, spake in this wise :<br/>"O my children! my poor children!<br/>Listen to the words of wisdom,<br/>Listen to the words of warning,<br/>From the lips of the Great Spirit,<br/>From the Master of Life, who made you!<br/>"I have given you lands to hunt in,<br/>I have given you streams to fish in,<br/>I have given you bear and bison,<br/>I have given you roe and reindeer,<br/>I have given you brant and beaver,<br/>Filled the marshes full of wild-fowl,<br/>Filled the rivers full of fishes:<br/>Why then are you not contented?<br/>Why then will you hunt each other?<br/>"I am weary of your quarrels,<br/>Weary of your wars and bloodshed,<br/>Weary of your prayers for vengeance,<br/>Of your wranglings and dissensions;<br/>All your strength is in your union,<br/>All your danger is in discord;<br/>Therefore be at peace henceforward,<br/>And as brothers live together.<br/>"I will send a Prophet to you,<br/>A Deliverer of the nations,<br/>Who shall guide you and shall teach you,<br/>Who shall toil and suffer with you.<br/>If you listen to his counsels,<br/>You will multiply and prosper;<br/>If his warnings pass unheeded,<br/>You will fade away and perish!<br/>"Bathe now in the stream before you,<br/>Wash the war-paint from your faces,<br/>Wash the blood-stains from your fingers,<br/>Bury your war-clubs and your weapons,<br/>Break the red stone from this quarry,<br/>Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes,<br/>Take the reeds that grow beside you,<br/>Deck them with your brightest feathers,<br/>Smoke the calumet together,<br/>And as brothers live henceforward!"<br/>Then upon the ground the warriors<br/>Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin,<br/>Threw their weapons and their war-gear,<br/>Leaped into the rushing river,<br/>Washed the war-paint from their faces.<br/>Clear above them flowed the water,<br/>Clear and limpid from the footprints<br/>Of the Master of Life descending;<br/>Dark below them flowed the water,<br/>Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson,<br/>As if blood were mingled with it!<br/>From the river came the warriors,<br/>Clean and washed from all their war-paint;<br/>On the banks their clubs they buried,<br/>Buried all their warlike weapons.<br/>Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>The Great Spirit, the creator,<br/>Smiled upon his helpless children!<br/>And in silence all the warriors<br/>Broke the red stone of the quarry,<br/>Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes,<br/>Broke the long reeds by the river,<br/>Decked them with their brightest feathers,<br/>And departed each one homeward,<br/>While the Master of Life, ascending,<br/>Through the opening of cloud-curtains,<br/>Through the doorways of the heaven,<br/>Vanished from before their faces,<br/>In the smoke that rolled around him,<br/>The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe!
