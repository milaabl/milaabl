# üíÆ Paradise Regained: The Third Book by *John Milton*

<p>
    So spake the Son of God; and Satan stood<br/>A while as mute, confounded what to say,<br/>What to reply, confuted and convinced<br/>Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift;<br/>At length, collecting all his serpent wiles,<br/>With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:‚Äî<br/>  "I see thou know'st what is of use to know,<br/>What best to say canst say, to do canst do;<br/>Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words<br/>To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart<br/>Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape.<br/>Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult,<br/>Thy counsel would be as the oracle<br/>Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems<br/>On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old<br/>Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds<br/>That might require the array of war, thy skill<br/>Of conduct would be such that all the world<br/>Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist<br/>In battle, though against thy few in arms.<br/>These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide?<br/>Affecting private life, or more obscure<br/>In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive<br/>All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself<br/>The fame and glory‚Äîglory, the reward<br/>That sole excites to high attempts the flame<br/>Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure<br/>AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise,<br/>All treasures and all gain esteem as dross,<br/>And dignities and powers, all but the highest?<br/>Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe.  The son<br/>Of Macedonian Philip had ere these<br/>Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held<br/>At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down<br/>The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled<br/>The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode.<br/>Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,<br/>Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment.<br/>Great Julius, whom now all the world admires,<br/>The more he grew in years, the more inflamed<br/>With glory, wept that he had lived so long<br/>Ingloroious.  But thou yet art not too late."<br/>  To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:‚Äî<br/>"Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth<br/>For empire's sake, nor empire to affect<br/>For glory's sake, by all thy argument.<br/>For what is glory but the blaze of fame,<br/>The people's praise, if always praise unmixed?<br/>And what the people but a herd confused,<br/>A miscellaneous rabble, who extol<br/>Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?<br/>They praise and they admire they know not what,<br/>And know not whom, but as one leads the other;<br/>And what delight to be by such extolled,<br/>To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?<br/>Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise‚Äî<br/>His lot who dares be singularly good.<br/>The intelligent among them and the wise<br/>Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised.<br/>This is true glory and renown‚Äîwhen God,<br/>Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks<br/>The just man, and divulges him through Heaven<br/>To all his Angels, who with true applause<br/>Recount his praises.  Thus he did to Job,<br/>When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth,<br/>As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember,<br/>He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?'<br/>Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known,<br/>Where glory is false glory, attributed<br/>To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.<br/>They err who count it glorious to subdue<br/>By conquest far and wide, to overrun<br/>Large countries, and in field great battles win,<br/>Great cities by assault.  What do these worthies<br/>But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave<br/>Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote,<br/>Made captive, yet deserving freedom more<br/>Than those their conquerors, who leave behind<br/>Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove,<br/>And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;<br/>Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods,<br/>Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,<br/>Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?<br/>One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;<br/>Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men,<br/>Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed,<br/>Violent or shameful death their due reward.<br/>But, if there be in glory aught of good;<br/>It may be means far different be attained,<br/>Without ambition, war, or violence‚Äî<br/>By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,<br/>By patience, temperance.  I mention still<br/>Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne,<br/>Made famous in a land and times obscure;<br/>Who names not now with honour patient Job?<br/>Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?)<br/>By what he taught and suffered for so doing,<br/>For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now<br/>Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.<br/>Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,<br/>Aught suffered‚Äîif young African for fame<br/>His wasted country freed from Punic rage‚Äî<br/>The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least,<br/>And loses, though but verbal, his reward.<br/>Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,<br/>Oft not deserved?  I seek not mine, but His<br/>Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am."<br/>  To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:‚Äî<br/>"Think not so slight of glory, therein least<br/>Resembling thy great Father.  He seeks glory,<br/>And for his glory all things made, all things<br/>Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven,<br/>By all his Angels glorified, requires<br/>Glory from men, from all men, good or bad,<br/>Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption.<br/>Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift,<br/>Glory he requires, and glory he receives,<br/>Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek,<br/>Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared;<br/>From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts."<br/>  To whom our Saviour fervently replied:<br/>"And reason; since his Word all things produced,<br/>Though chiefly not for glory as prime end,<br/>But to shew forth his goodness, and impart<br/>His good communicable to every soul<br/>Freely; of whom what could He less expect<br/>Than glory and benediction‚Äîthat is, thanks‚Äî<br/>The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense<br/>From them who could return him nothing else,<br/>And, not returning that, would likeliest render<br/>Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?<br/>Hard recompense, unsuitable return<br/>For so much good, so much beneficience!<br/>But why should man seek glory, who of his own<br/>Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs<br/>But condemnation, ignominy, and shame‚Äî<br/>Who, for so many benefits received,<br/>Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false,<br/>And so of all true good himself despoiled;<br/>Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take<br/>That which to God alone of right belongs?<br/>Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace,<br/>That who advances his glory, not their own,<br/>Them he himself to glory will advance."<br/>  So spake the Son of God; and here again<br/>Satan had not to answer, but stood struck<br/>With guilt of his own sin‚Äîfor he himself,<br/>Insatiable of glory, had lost all;<br/>Yet of another plea bethought him soon:‚Äî<br/>  "Of glory, as thou wilt," said he, "so deem;<br/>Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass.<br/>But to a Kingdom thou art born‚Äîordained<br/>To sit upon thy father David's throne,<br/>By mother's side thy father, though thy right<br/>Be now in powerful hands, that will not part<br/>Easily from possession won with arms.<br/>Judaea now and all the Promised Land,<br/>Reduced a province under Roman yoke,<br/>Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled<br/>With temperate sway: oft have they violated<br/>The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts,<br/>Abominations rather, as did once<br/>Antiochus.  And think'st thou to regain<br/>Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?<br/>So did not Machabeus.  He indeed<br/>Retired unto the Desert, but with arms;<br/>And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed<br/>That by strong hand his family obtained,<br/>Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped,<br/>With Modin and her suburbs once content.<br/>If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal<br/>And duty‚Äîzeal and duty are not slow,<br/>But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait:<br/>They themselves rather are occasion best‚Äî<br/>Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free<br/>Thy country from her heathen servitude.<br/>So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify,<br/>The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign‚Äî<br/>The happier reign the sooner it begins.<br/>Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?"<br/>  To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:‚Äî<br/>"All things are best fulfilled in their due time;<br/>And time there is for all things, Truth hath said.<br/>If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told<br/>That it shall never end, so, when begin<br/>The Father in his purpose hath decreed‚Äî<br/>He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.<br/>What if he hath decreed that I shall first<br/>Be tried in humble state, and things adverse,<br/>By tribulations, injuries, insults,<br/>Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,<br/>Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting<br/>Without distrust or doubt, that He may know<br/>What I can suffer, how obey?  Who best<br/>Can suffer best can do, best reign who first<br/>Well hath obeyed‚Äîjust trial ere I merit<br/>My exaltation without change or end.<br/>But what concerns it thee when I begin<br/>My everlasting Kingdom?  Why art thou<br/>Solicitous?  What moves thy inquisition?<br/>Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall,<br/>And my promotion will be thy destruction?"<br/>  To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:‚Äî<br/>"Let that come when it comes.  All hope is lost<br/>Of my reception into grace; what worse?<br/>For where no hope is left is left no fear.<br/>If there be worse, the expectation more<br/>Of worse torments me than the feeling can.<br/>I would be at the worst; worst is my port,<br/>My harbour, and my ultimate repose,<br/>The end I would attain, my final good.<br/>My error was my error, and my crime<br/>My crime; whatever, for itself condemned,<br/>And will alike be punished, whether thou<br/>Reign or reign not‚Äîthough to that gentle brow<br/>Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign,<br/>From that placid aspect and meek regard,<br/>Rather than aggravate my evil state,<br/>Would stand between me and thy Father's ire<br/>(Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)<br/>A shelter and a kind of shading cool<br/>Interposition, as a summer's cloud.<br/>If I, then, to the worst that can be haste,<br/>Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?<br/>Happiest, both to thyself and all the world,<br/>That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King!<br/>Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained<br/>Of the enterprise so hazardous and high!<br/>No wonder; for, though in thee be united<br/>What of perfection can in Man be found,<br/>Or human nature can receive, consider<br/>Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent<br/>At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns,<br/>And once a year Jerusalem, few days'<br/>Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe?<br/>The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory,<br/>Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts‚Äî<br/>Best school of best experience, quickest in sight<br/>In all things that to greatest actions lead.<br/>The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever<br/>Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty<br/>(As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom)<br/>Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous.<br/>But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit<br/>Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes<br/>The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state‚Äî<br/>Sufficient introduction to inform<br/>Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts,<br/>And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know<br/>How best their opposition to withstand."<br/>  With that (such power was given him then), he took<br/>The Son of God up to a mountain high.<br/>It was a mountain at whose verdant feet<br/>A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide<br/>Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed,<br/>The one winding, the other straight, and left between<br/>Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined,<br/>Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea.<br/>Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine;<br/>With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;<br/>Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem<br/>The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large<br/>The prospect was that here and there was room<br/>For barren desert, fountainless and dry.<br/>To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought<br/>Our Saviour, and new train of words began:‚Äî<br/>  "Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale,<br/>Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers,<br/>Cut shorter many a league.  Here thou behold'st<br/>Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds,<br/>Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on<br/>As far as Indus east, Euphrates west,<br/>And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay,<br/>And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth:<br/>Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall<br/>Several days' journey, built by Ninus old,<br/>Of that first golden monarchy the seat,<br/>And seat of Salmanassar, whose success<br/>Israel in long captivity still mourns;<br/>There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,<br/>As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice<br/>Judah and all thy father David's house<br/>Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste,<br/>Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis,<br/>His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there;<br/>Ecbatana her structure vast there shews,<br/>And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates;<br/>There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream,<br/>The drink of none but kings; of later fame,<br/>Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,<br/>The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there<br/>Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon,<br/>Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold.<br/>All these the Parthian (now some ages past<br/>By great Arsaces led, who founded first<br/>That empire) under his dominion holds,<br/>From the luxurious kings of Antioch won.<br/>And just in time thou com'st to have a view<br/>Of his great power; for now the Parthian king<br/>In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host<br/>Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild<br/>Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid<br/>He marches now in haste.  See, though from far,<br/>His thousands, in what martial equipage<br/>They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms,<br/>Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit‚Äî<br/>All horsemen, in which fight they most excel;<br/>See how in warlike muster they appear,<br/>In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings."<br/>  He looked, and saw what numbers numberless<br/>The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops<br/>In coats of mail and military pride.<br/>In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong,<br/>Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice<br/>Of many provinces from bound to bound‚Äî<br/>From Arachosia, from Candaor east,<br/>And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs<br/>Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;<br/>From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains<br/>Of Adiabene, Media, and the south<br/>Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven.<br/>He saw them in their forms of battle ranged,<br/>How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot<br/>Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face<br/>Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight;<br/>The field all iron cast a gleaming brown.<br/>Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn,<br/>Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight,<br/>Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers<br/>Of archers; nor of labouring pioners<br/>A multitude, with spades and axes armed,<br/>To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,<br/>Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay<br/>With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke:<br/>Mules after these, camels and dromedaries,<br/>And waggons fraught with utensils of war.<br/>Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,<br/>When Agrican, with all his northern powers,<br/>Besieged Albracea, as romances tell,<br/>The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win<br/>The fairest of her sex, Angelica,<br/>His daughter, sought by many prowest knights,<br/>Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane.<br/>Such and so numerous was their chivalry;<br/>At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed,<br/>And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:‚Äî<br/>  "That thou may'st know I seek not to engage<br/>Thy virtue, and not every way secure<br/>On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark<br/>To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew<br/>All this fair sight.  Thy kingdom, though foretold<br/>By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou<br/>Endeavour, as thy father David did,<br/>Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still<br/>In all things, and all men, supposes means;<br/>Without means used, what it predicts revokes.<br/>But say thou wert possessed of David's throne<br/>By free consent of all, none opposite,<br/>Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope<br/>Long to enjoy it quiet and secure<br/>Between two such enclosing enemies,<br/>Roman and Parthian?  Therefore one of these<br/>Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first,<br/>By my advice, as nearer, and of late<br/>Found able by invasion to annoy<br/>Thy country, and captive lead away her kings,<br/>Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound,<br/>Maugre the Roman.  It shall be my task<br/>To render thee the Parthian at dispose,<br/>Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.<br/>By him thou shalt regain, without him not,<br/>That which alone can truly reinstall thee<br/>In David's royal seat, his true successor‚Äî<br/>Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes<br/>Whose offspring in his territory yet serve<br/>In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed:<br/>The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost<br/>Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old<br/>Their fathers in the land of Egypt served,<br/>This offer sets before thee to deliver.<br/>These if from servitude thou shalt restore<br/>To their inheritance, then, nor till then,<br/>Thou on the throne of David in full glory,<br/>From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond,<br/>Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear."<br/>  To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:‚Äî<br/>"Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm<br/>And fragile arms, much instrument of war,<br/>Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought,<br/>Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear<br/>Vented much policy, and projects deep<br/>Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues,<br/>Plausible to the world, to me worth naught.<br/>Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else<br/>Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne!<br/>My time, I told thee (and that time for thee<br/>Were better farthest off), is not yet come.<br/>When that comes, think not thou to find me slack<br/>On my part aught endeavouring, or to need<br/>Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome<br/>Luggage of war there shewn me‚Äîargument<br/>Of human weakness rather than of strength.<br/>My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes,<br/>I must deliver, if I mean to reign<br/>David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway<br/>To just extent over all Israel's sons!<br/>But whence to thee this zeal?  Where was it then<br/>For Israel, or for David, or his throne,<br/>When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride<br/>Of numbering Israel‚Äîwhich cost the lives<br/>of threescore and ten thousand Israelites<br/>By three days' pestilence?  Such was thy zeal<br/>To Israel then, the same that now to me.<br/>As for those captive tribes, themselves were they<br/>Who wrought their own captivity, fell off<br/>From God to worship calves, the deities<br/>Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth,<br/>And all the idolatries of heathen round,<br/>Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes;<br/>Nor in the land of their captivity<br/>Humbled themselves, or penitent besought<br/>The God of their forefathers, but so died<br/>Impenitent, and left a race behind<br/>Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce<br/>From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain,<br/>And God with idols in their worship joined.<br/>Should I of these the liberty regard,<br/>Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony,<br/>Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed,<br/>Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps<br/>Of Bethel and of Dan?  No; let them serve<br/>Their enemies who serve idols with God.<br/>Yet He at length, time to himself best known,<br/>Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call<br/>May bring them back, repentant and sincere,<br/>And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood,<br/>While to their native land with joy they haste,<br/>As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft,<br/>When to the Promised Land their fathers passed.<br/>To his due time and providence I leave them."<br/>  So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend<br/>Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles.<br/>So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.
