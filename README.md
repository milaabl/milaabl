# üíÆ Rudiger - A Ballad by *Robert Southey*

<p>
    Author Note: Divers Princes and Noblemen being assembled in a beautiful and fair<br/>Palace, which was situate upon the river Rhine, they beheld a boat or<br/>small barge make toward the shore, drawn by a Swan in a silver chain,<br/>the one end fastened about her neck, the other to the vessel; and in it<br/>an unknown soldier, a man of a comely personage and graceful presence,<br/>who stept upon the shore; which done, the boat guided by the Swan left<br/>him, and floated down the river. This man fell afterward in league with<br/>a fair gentlewoman, married her, and by her had many children. After<br/>some years, the same Swan came with the same barge into the same place;<br/>the soldier entering into it, was carried thence the way he came, left<br/>wife, children and family, and was never seen amongst them after.<br/><br/>Now who can judge this to be other than one of those spirits that are<br/>named Incubi? says Thomas Heywood. I have adopted his story, but not his<br/>solution, making the unknown soldier not an evil spirit, but one who had<br/>purchased happiness of a malevolent being, by the promised sacrifice of<br/>his first-born child.<br/><br/>.................<br/><br/>Bright on the mountain's heathy slope<br/>The day's last splendors shine<br/>And rich with many a radiant hue<br/>Gleam gayly on the Rhine.<br/><br/>And many a one from Waldhurst's walls<br/>Along the river stroll'd,<br/>As ruffling o'er the pleasant stream<br/>The evening gales came cold.<br/><br/>So as they stray'd a swan they saw<br/>Sail stately up and strong,<br/>And by a silver chain she drew<br/>A little boat along,<br/><br/>Whose streamer to the gentle breeze<br/>Long floating fluttered light,<br/>Beneath whose crimson canopy<br/>There lay reclin'd a knight.<br/><br/>With arching crest and swelling breast<br/>On sail'd the stately swan<br/>And lightly up the parting tide<br/>The little boat came on.<br/><br/>And onward to the shore they drew<br/>And leapt to land the knight,<br/>And down the stream the swan-drawn boat<br/>Fell soon beyond the sight.<br/><br/>Was never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls<br/>Might match with Margaret,<br/>Her cheek was fair, her eyes were dark,<br/>Her silken locks like jet.<br/><br/>And many a rich and noble youth<br/>Had strove to win the fair,<br/>But never a rich or noble youth<br/>Could rival Rudiger.<br/><br/>At every tilt and turney he<br/>Still bore away the prize,<br/>For knightly feats superior still<br/>And knightly courtesies.<br/><br/>His gallant feats, his looks, his love,<br/>Soon won the willing fair,<br/>And soon did Margaret become<br/>The wife of Rudiger.<br/><br/>Like morning dreams of happiness<br/>Fast roll'd the months away,<br/>For he was kind and she was kind<br/>And who so blest as they?<br/><br/>Yet Rudiger would sometimes sit<br/>Absorb'd in silent thought<br/>And his dark downward eye would seem<br/>With anxious meaning fraught;<br/><br/>But soon he rais'd his looks again<br/>And smil'd his cares eway,<br/>And mid the hall of gaiety<br/>Was none like him so gay.<br/><br/>And onward roll'd the waining months,<br/>The hour appointed came,<br/>And Margaret her Rudiger<br/>Hail'd with a father's name.<br/><br/>But silently did Rudiger<br/>The little infant see,<br/>And darkly on the babe he gaz'd<br/>And very sad was he.<br/><br/>And when to bless the little babe<br/>The holy Father came,<br/>To cleanse the stains of sin away<br/>In Christ's redeeming name,<br/><br/>Then did the cheek of Rudiger<br/>Assume a death-pale hue,<br/>And on his clammy forehead stood<br/>The cold convulsive dew;<br/><br/>And faltering in his speech he bade<br/>The Priest the rites delay,<br/>Till he could, to right health restor'd,<br/>Enjoy the festive day.<br/><br/>When o'er the many-tinted sky<br/>He saw the day decline,<br/>He called upon his Margaret<br/>To walk beside the Rhine.<br/><br/>"And we will take the little babe,<br/>"For soft the breeze that blows,<br/>"And the wild murmurs of the stream<br/>"Will lull him to repose."<br/><br/>So forth together did they go,<br/>The evening breeze was mild,<br/>And Rudiger upon his arm<br/>Did pillow the sweet child.<br/><br/>And many a one from Waldhurst's walls<br/>Along the banks did roam,<br/>But soon the evening wind came cold,<br/>And all betook them home.<br/><br/>Yet Rudiger in silent mood<br/>Along the banks would roam,<br/>Nor aught could Margaret prevail<br/>To turn his footsteps home.<br/><br/>"Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,<br/>"The rising mists behold,<br/>"The evening wind is damp and chill,<br/>"The little babe is cold!"<br/><br/>"Now hush thee--hush thee Margaret,<br/>"The mists will do no harm,<br/>"And from the wind the little babe<br/>"Lies sheltered on my arm."<br/><br/>"Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,<br/>"Why onward wilt thou roam?<br/>"The moon is up, the night is cold,<br/>"And we are far from home."<br/><br/>He answered not, for now he saw<br/>A Swan come sailing strong,<br/>And by a silver chain she drew<br/>A little boat along.<br/><br/>To shore they came, and to the boat<br/>Fast leapt he with the child,<br/>And in leapt Margaret--breathless now<br/>And pale with fear and wild.<br/><br/>With arching crest and swelling breast<br/>On sail'd the stately swan,<br/>And lightly down the rapid tide<br/>The little boat went on.<br/><br/>The full-orb'd moon that beam'd around<br/>Pale splendor thro' the night,<br/>Cast through the crimson canopy<br/>A dim-discoloured light.<br/><br/>And swiftly down the hurrying stream<br/>In silence still they sail,<br/>And the long streamer fluttering fast<br/>Flapp'd to the heavy gale.<br/><br/>And he was mute in sullen thought<br/>And she was mute with fear,<br/>Nor sound but of the parting tide<br/>Broke on the listening ear.<br/><br/>The little babe began to cry<br/>And waked his mother's care,<br/>"Now give to me the little babe<br/>"For God's sake, Rudiger!"<br/><br/>"Now hush thee, hush thee Margaret!<br/>"Nor my poor heart distress--<br/>"I do but pay perforce the price<br/>"Of former happiness.<br/><br/>"And hush thee too my little babe,<br/>"Thy cries so feeble cease:<br/>"Lie still, lie still;--a little while<br/>"And thou shalt be at peace."<br/><br/>So as he spake to land they drew,<br/>And swift he stept on shore,<br/>And him behind did Margaret<br/>Close follow evermore.<br/><br/>It was a place all desolate,<br/>Nor house nor tree was there,<br/>And there a rocky mountain rose<br/>Barren, and bleak, and bare.<br/><br/>And at its base a cavern yawn'd,<br/>No eye its depth might view,<br/>For in the moon-beam shining round<br/>That darkness darker grew.<br/><br/>Cold Horror crept thro' Margaret's blood,<br/>Her heart it paus'd with fear,<br/>When Rudiger approach'd the cave<br/>And cried, "lo I am here!"<br/><br/>A deep sepulchral sound the cave<br/>Return'd "lo I am here!"<br/>And black from out the cavern gloom<br/>Two giant arms appear.<br/><br/>And Rudiger approach'd and held<br/>The little infant nigh;<br/>Then Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then<br/>New powers from agony.<br/><br/>And round the baby fast and firm<br/>Her trembling arms she folds,<br/>And with a strong convulsive grasp<br/>The little infant holds.<br/><br/>"Now help me, Jesus!" loud she cries.<br/>And loud on God she calls;<br/>Then from the grasp of Rudiger<br/>The little infant falls.<br/><br/>And now he shriek'd, for now his frame<br/>The huge black arms clasp'd round,<br/>And dragg'd the wretched Rudiger<br/>Adown the dark profound.
