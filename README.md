# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Wife of Bath's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>Experience, though none authority<br/>Were in this world, is right enough for me<br/>To speak of woe that is in marriage:<br/>For, lordings, since I twelve year was of age,<br/>(Thanked be God that is etern on live),<br/>Husbands at the church door have I had five,<br/>For I so often have y-wedded be,<br/>And all were worthy men in their degree.<br/>But me was told, not longe time gone is<br/>That sithen Christe went never but ones<br/>To wedding, in the Cane of Galilee,<br/>That by that ilk example taught he me,<br/>That I not wedded shoulde be but once.<br/>Lo, hearken eke a sharp word for the nonce,<br/>Beside a welle Jesus, God and man,<br/>Spake in reproof of the Samaritan:<br/>"Thou hast y-had five husbandes," said he;<br/>"And thilke man, that now hath wedded thee,<br/>Is not thine husband:"  thus said he certain;<br/>What that he meant thereby, I cannot sayn.<br/>But that I aske, why the fifthe man<br/>Was not husband to the Samaritan?<br/>How many might she have in marriage?<br/>Yet heard I never tellen in mine age<br/>Upon this number definitioun.<br/>Men may divine, and glosen up and down;<br/>But well I wot, express without a lie,<br/>God bade us for to wax and multiply;<br/>That gentle text can I well understand.<br/>Eke well I wot, he said, that mine husband<br/>Should leave father and mother, and take to me;<br/>But of no number mention made he,<br/>Of bigamy or of octogamy;<br/>Why then should men speak of it villainy?<br/><br/>Lo here, the wise king Dan Solomon,<br/>I trow that he had wives more than one;<br/>As would to God it lawful were to me<br/>To be refreshed half so oft as he!<br/>What gift of God had he for all his wives?<br/>No man hath such, that in this world alive is.<br/>God wot, this noble king, as to my wit,<br/>The first night had many a merry fit<br/>With each of them, so well was him on live.<br/>Blessed be God that I have wedded five!<br/>Welcome the sixth whenever that he shall.<br/>For since I will not keep me chaste in all,<br/>When mine husband is from the world y-gone,<br/>Some Christian man shall wedde me anon.<br/>For then th' apostle saith that I am free<br/>To wed, a' God's half, where it liketh me.<br/>He saith, that to be wedded is no sin;<br/>Better is to be wedded than to brin.<br/>What recketh me though folk say villainy<br/>Of shrewed Lamech, and his bigamy?<br/>I wot well Abraham was a holy man,<br/>And Jacob eke, as far as ev'r I can.<br/>And each of them had wives more than two;<br/>And many another holy man also.<br/>Where can ye see, in any manner age,<br/>That highe God defended marriage<br/>By word express? I pray you tell it me;<br/>Or where commanded he virginity?<br/>I wot as well as you, it is no dread,<br/>Th' apostle, when he spake of maidenhead,<br/>He said, that precept thereof had he none:<br/>Men may counsel a woman to be one,<br/>But counseling is no commandement;<br/>He put it in our owen judgement.<br/>For, hadde God commanded maidenhead,<br/>Then had he damned wedding out of dread;<br/>And certes, if there were no seed y-sow,<br/>Virginity then whereof should it grow?<br/>Paul durste not commanden, at the least,<br/>A thing of which his Master gave no hest.<br/>The dart is set up for virginity;<br/>Catch whoso may, who runneth best let see.<br/>But this word is not ta'en of every wight,<br/>But there as God will give it of his might.<br/>I wot well that th' apostle was a maid,<br/>But natheless, although he wrote and said,<br/>He would that every wight were such as he,<br/>All is but counsel to virginity.<br/>And, since to be a wife he gave me leave<br/>Of indulgence, so is it no repreve<br/>To wedde me, if that my make should die,<br/>Without exception of bigamy;<br/>All were it good no woman for to touch<br/>(He meant as in his bed or in his couch),<br/>For peril is both fire and tow t'assemble<br/>Ye know what this example may resemble.<br/>This is all and some, he held virginity<br/>More profit than wedding in frailty:<br/>(Frailty clepe I, but if that he and she<br/>Would lead their lives all in chastity),<br/>I grant it well, I have of none envy<br/>Who maidenhead prefer to bigamy;<br/>It liketh them t' be clean in body and ghost;<br/>Of mine estate I will not make a boast.<br/><br/>For, well ye know, a lord in his household<br/>Hath not every vessel all of gold;<br/>Some are of tree, and do their lord service.<br/>God calleth folk to him in sundry wise,<br/>And each one hath of God a proper gift,<br/>Some this, some that, as liketh him to shift.<br/>Virginity is great perfection,<br/>And continence eke with devotion:<br/>But Christ, that of perfection is the well,<br/>Bade not every wight he should go sell<br/>All that he had, and give it to the poor,<br/>And in such wise follow him and his lore:<br/>He spake to them that would live perfectly, --<br/>And, lordings, by your leave, that am not I;<br/>I will bestow the flower of mine age<br/>In th' acts and in the fruits of marriage.<br/>Tell me also, to what conclusion<br/>Were members made of generation,<br/>And of so perfect wise a wight y-wrought?<br/>Trust me right well, they were not made for nought.<br/>Glose whoso will, and say both up and down,<br/>That they were made for the purgatioun<br/>Of urine, and of other thinges smale,<br/>And eke to know a female from a male:<br/>And for none other cause? say ye no?<br/>Experience wot well it is not so.<br/>So that the clerkes be not with me wroth,<br/>I say this, that they were made for both,<br/>That is to say, for office, and for ease<br/>Of engendrure, there we God not displease.<br/>Why should men elles in their bookes set,<br/>That man shall yield unto his wife her debt?<br/>Now wherewith should he make his payement,<br/>If he us'd not his silly instrument?<br/>Then were they made upon a creature<br/>To purge urine, and eke for engendrure.<br/>But I say not that every wight is hold,<br/>That hath such harness as I to you told,<br/>To go and use them in engendrure;<br/>Then should men take of chastity no cure.<br/>Christ was a maid, and shapen as a man,<br/>And many a saint, since that this world began,<br/>Yet ever liv'd in perfect chastity.<br/>I will not vie with no virginity.<br/>Let them with bread of pured wheat be fed,<br/>And let us wives eat our barley bread.<br/>And yet with barley bread, Mark tell us can,<br/>Our Lord Jesus refreshed many a man.<br/>In such estate as God hath cleped us,<br/>I'll persevere, I am not precious,<br/>In wifehood I will use mine instrument<br/>As freely as my Maker hath it sent.<br/>If I be dangerous God give me sorrow;<br/>Mine husband shall it have, both eve and morrow,<br/>When that him list come forth and pay his debt.<br/>A husband will I have, I will no let,<br/>Which shall be both my debtor and my thrall,<br/>And have his tribulation withal<br/>Upon his flesh, while that I am his wife.<br/>I have the power during all my life<br/>Upon his proper body, and not he;<br/>Right thus th' apostle told it unto me,<br/>And bade our husbands for to love us well;<br/>All this sentence me liketh every deal.<br/><br/>Up start the Pardoner, and that anon;<br/>"Now, Dame," quoth he, "by God and by Saint John,<br/>Ye are a noble preacher in this case.<br/>I was about to wed a wife, alas!<br/>What? should I bie it on my flesh so dear?<br/>Yet had I lever wed no wife this year."<br/>"Abide," quoth she; "my tale is not begun<br/>Nay, thou shalt drinken of another tun<br/>Ere that I go, shall savour worse than ale.<br/>And when that I have told thee forth my tale<br/>Of tribulation in marriage,<br/>Of which I am expert in all mine age,<br/>(This is to say, myself hath been the whip),<br/>Then mayest thou choose whether thou wilt sip<br/>Of thilke tunne, that I now shall broach.<br/>Beware of it, ere thou too nigh approach,<br/>For I shall tell examples more than ten:<br/>Whoso will not beware by other men,<br/>By him shall other men corrected be:<br/>These same wordes writeth Ptolemy;<br/>Read in his Almagest, and take it there."<br/>"Dame, I would pray you, if your will it were,"<br/>Saide this Pardoner, "as ye began,<br/>Tell forth your tale, and spare for no man,<br/>And teach us younge men of your practique."<br/>"Gladly," quoth she, "since that it may you like.<br/>But that I pray to all this company,<br/>If that I speak after my fantasy,<br/>To take nought agrief what I may say;<br/>For mine intent is only for to play.<br/><br/>Now, Sirs, then will I tell you forth my tale.<br/>As ever may I drinke wine or ale<br/>I shall say sooth; the husbands that I had<br/>Three of them were good, and two were bad<br/>The three were goode men, and rich, and old<br/>Unnethes mighte they the statute hold<br/>In which that they were bounden unto me.<br/>Yet wot well what I mean of this, pardie.<br/>As God me help, I laugh when that I think<br/>How piteously at night I made them swink,<br/>But, by my fay, I told of it no store:<br/>They had me giv'n their land and their treasor,<br/>Me needed not do longer diligence<br/>To win their love, or do them reverence.<br/>They loved me so well, by God above,<br/>That I tolde no dainty of their love.<br/>A wise woman will busy her ever-in-one<br/>To get their love, where that she hath none.<br/>But, since I had them wholly in my hand,<br/>And that they had me given all their land,<br/>Why should I take keep them for to please,<br/>But it were for my profit, or mine ease?<br/>I set them so a-worke, by my fay,<br/>That many a night they sange, well-away!<br/>The bacon was not fetched for them, I trow,<br/>That some men have in Essex at Dunmow.<br/>I govern'd them so well after my law,<br/>That each of them full blissful was and fawe<br/>To bringe me gay thinges from the fair.<br/>They were full glad when that I spake them fair,<br/>For, God it wot, I chid them spiteously.<br/>Now hearken how I bare me properly.<br/><br/>Ye wise wives, that can understand,<br/>Thus should ye speak, and bear them wrong on hand,<br/>For half so boldely can there no man<br/>Swearen and lien as a woman can.<br/>(I say not this by wives that be wise,<br/>But if it be when they them misadvise.)<br/>A wise wife, if that she can her good,<br/>Shall beare them on hand the cow is wood,<br/>And take witness of her owen maid<br/>Of their assent: but hearken how I said.<br/>"Sir olde  kaynard, is this thine array?<br/>Why is my neigheboure's wife so gay?<br/>She is honour'd over all where she go'th,<br/>I sit at home, I have no thrifty cloth.<br/>What dost thou at my neigheboure's house?<br/>Is she so fair? art thou so amorous?<br/>What rown'st thou with our maid? benedicite,<br/>Sir olde lechour, let thy japes be.<br/>And if I have a gossip, or a friend<br/>(Withoute guilt), thou chidest as a fiend,<br/>If that I walk or play unto his house.<br/>Thou comest home as drunken as a mouse,<br/>And preachest on thy bench, with evil prefe:<br/>Thou say'st to me, it is a great mischief<br/>To wed a poore woman, for costage:<br/>And if that she be rich, of high parage;<br/>Then say'st thou, that it is a tormentry<br/>To suffer her pride and melancholy.<br/>And if that she be fair, thou very knave,<br/>Thou say'st that every holour will her have;<br/>She may no while in chastity abide,<br/>That is assailed upon every side.<br/>Thou say'st some folk desire us for richess,<br/>Some for our shape, and some for our fairness,<br/>And some, for she can either sing or dance,<br/>And some for gentiless and dalliance,<br/>Some for her handes and her armes smale:<br/>Thus goes all to the devil, by thy tale;<br/>Thou say'st, men may not keep a castle wall<br/>That may be so assailed over all.<br/>And if that she be foul, thou say'st that she<br/>Coveteth every man that she may see;<br/>For as a spaniel she will on him leap,<br/>Till she may finde some man her to cheap;<br/>And none so grey goose goes there in the lake,<br/>(So say'st thou) that will be without a make.<br/>And say'st, it is a hard thing for to weld<br/>A thing that no man will, his thankes, held.<br/>Thus say'st thou, lorel, when thou go'st to bed,<br/>And that no wise man needeth for to wed,<br/>Nor no man that intendeth unto heaven.<br/>With wilde thunder dint and fiery leven<br/>Mote thy wicked necke be to-broke.<br/>Thou say'st, that dropping houses, and eke smoke,<br/>And chiding wives, make men to flee<br/>Out of their owne house; ah! ben'dicite,<br/>What aileth such an old man for to chide?<br/>Thou say'st, we wives will our vices hide,<br/>Till we be fast, and then we will them shew.<br/>Well may that be a proverb of a shrew.<br/>Thou say'st, that oxen, asses, horses, hounds,<br/>They be assayed at diverse stounds,<br/>Basons and lavers, ere that men them buy,<br/>Spoones, stooles, and all such husbandry,<br/>And so be pots, and clothes, and array,<br/>But folk of wives make none assay,<br/>Till they be wedded, -- olde dotard shrew! --<br/>And then, say'st thou, we will our vices shew.<br/>Thou say'st also, that it displeaseth me,<br/>But if  that thou wilt praise my beauty,<br/>And but thou pore alway upon my face,<br/>And call me faire dame in every place;<br/>And but thou make a feast on thilke day<br/>That I was born, and make me fresh and gay;<br/>And but thou do to my norice honour,<br/>And to my chamberere within my bow'r,<br/>And to my father's folk, and mine allies;<br/>Thus sayest thou, old barrel full of lies.<br/>And yet also of our prentice Jenkin,<br/>For his crisp hair, shining as gold so fine,<br/>And for he squireth me both up and down,<br/>Yet hast thou caught a false suspicioun:<br/>I will him not, though thou wert dead to-morrow.<br/>But tell me this, why hidest thou, with sorrow,<br/>The keyes of thy chest away from me?<br/>It is my good as well as thine, pardie.<br/>What, think'st to make an idiot of our dame?<br/>Now, by that lord that called is Saint Jame,<br/>Thou shalt not both, although that thou wert wood,<br/>Be master of my body, and my good,<br/>The one thou shalt forego, maugre thine eyen.<br/>What helpeth it of me t'inquire and spyen?<br/>I trow thou wouldest lock me in thy chest.<br/>Thou shouldest say, 'Fair wife, go where thee lest;<br/>Take your disport; I will believe no tales;<br/>I know you for a true wife, Dame Ales.'<br/>We love no man, that taketh keep or charge<br/>Where that we go; we will be at our large.<br/>Of alle men most blessed may he be,<br/>The wise astrologer Dan Ptolemy,<br/>That saith this proverb in his Almagest:<br/>'Of alle men his wisdom is highest,<br/>That recketh not who hath the world in hand.<br/>By this proverb thou shalt well understand,<br/>Have thou enough, what thar thee reck or care<br/>How merrily that other folkes fare?<br/>For certes, olde dotard, by your leave,<br/>Ye shall have [pleasure]  right enough at eve.<br/>He is too great a niggard that will werne<br/>A man to light a candle at his lantern;<br/>He shall have never the less light, pardie.<br/>Have thou enough, thee thar not plaine thee<br/>Thou say'st also, if that we make us gay<br/>With clothing and with precious array,<br/>That it is peril of our chastity.<br/>And yet, -- with sorrow! -- thou enforcest thee,<br/>And say'st these words in the apostle's name:<br/>'In habit made with chastity and shame<br/>Ye women shall apparel you,' quoth he,<br/>'And not in tressed hair and gay perrie,<br/>As pearles, nor with gold, nor clothes rich.'<br/>After thy text nor after thy rubrich<br/>I will not work as muchel as a gnat.<br/>Thou say'st also, I walk out like a cat;<br/>For whoso woulde singe the catte's skin<br/>Then will the catte well dwell in her inn;<br/>And if the catte's skin be sleek and gay,<br/>She will not dwell in house half a day,<br/>But forth she will, ere any day be daw'd,<br/>To shew her skin, and go a caterwaw'd.<br/>This is to say, if I be gay, sir shrew,<br/>I will run out, my borel for to shew.<br/>Sir olde fool, what helpeth thee to spyen?<br/>Though thou pray Argus with his hundred eyen<br/>To be my wardecorps, as he can best<br/>In faith he shall not keep me, but me lest:<br/>Yet could I make his beard, so may I the.<br/><br/>"Thou sayest eke, that there be thinges three,<br/>Which thinges greatly trouble all this earth,<br/>And that no wighte may endure the ferth:<br/>O lefe sir shrew, may Jesus short thy life.<br/>Yet preachest thou, and say'st, a hateful wife<br/>Y-reckon'd is for one of these mischances.<br/>Be there none other manner resemblances<br/>That ye may liken your parables unto,<br/>But if a silly wife be one of tho?<br/>Thou likenest a woman's love to hell;<br/>To barren land where water may not dwell.<br/>Thou likenest it also to wild fire;<br/>The more it burns, the more it hath desire<br/>To consume every thing that burnt will be.<br/>Thou sayest, right as wormes shend a tree,<br/>Right so a wife destroyeth her husbond;<br/>This know they well that be to wives bond."<br/><br/>Lordings, right thus, as ye have understand,<br/>Bare I stiffly mine old husbands on hand,<br/>That thus they saiden in their drunkenness;<br/>And all was false, but that I took witness<br/>On Jenkin, and upon my niece also.<br/>O Lord! the pain I did them, and the woe,<br/>'Full guilteless, by Godde's sweete pine;<br/>For as a horse I coulde bite and whine;<br/>I coulde plain, an' I was in the guilt,<br/>Or elles oftentime I had been spilt<br/>Whoso first cometh to the nilll, first grint;<br/>I plained first, so was our war y-stint.<br/>They were full glad to excuse them full blive<br/>Of things that they never aguilt their live.<br/><br/>Of wenches would I beare them on hand,<br/>When that for sickness scarcely might they stand,<br/>Yet tickled I his hearte for that he<br/>Ween'd that I had of him so great cherte:<br/>I swore that all my walking out by night<br/>Was for to espy wenches that he dight:<br/>Under that colour had I many a mirth.<br/>For all such wit is given us at birth;<br/>Deceit, weeping, and spinning, God doth give<br/>To women kindly, while that they may live.<br/>And thus of one thing I may vaunte me,<br/>At th' end I had the better in each degree,<br/>By sleight, or force, or by some manner thing,<br/>As by continual murmur or grudging,<br/>Namely a-bed, there hadde they mischance,<br/>There would I chide, and do them no pleasance:<br/>I would no longer in the bed abide,<br/>If that I felt his arm over my side,<br/>Till he had made his ransom unto me,<br/>Then would I suffer him do his nicety.<br/>And therefore every man this tale I tell,<br/>Win whoso may, for all is for to sell;<br/>With empty hand men may no hawkes lure;<br/>For winning would I all his will endure,<br/>And make me a feigned appetite,<br/>And yet in bacon had I never delight:<br/>That made me that I ever would them chide.<br/>For, though the Pope had sitten them beside,<br/>I would not spare them at their owen board,<br/>For, by my troth, I quit them word for word<br/>As help me very God omnipotent,<br/>Though I right now should make my testament<br/>I owe them not a word, that is not quit<br/>I brought it so aboute by my wit,<br/>That they must give it up, as for the best<br/>Or elles had we never been in rest.<br/>For, though he looked as a wood lion,<br/>Yet should he fail of his conclusion.<br/>Then would I say, "Now, goode lefe tak keep<br/>How meekly looketh Wilken oure sheep!<br/>Come near, my spouse, and let me ba thy cheek<br/>Ye shoulde be all patient and meek,<br/>And have a sweet y-spiced conscience,<br/>Since ye so preach of Jobe's patience.<br/>Suffer alway, since ye so well can preach,<br/>And but ye do, certain we shall you teach<br/>That it is fair to have a wife in peace.<br/>One of us two must bowe doubteless:<br/>And since a man is more reasonable<br/>Than woman is, ye must be suff'rable.<br/>What aileth you to grudge thus and groan?<br/>Is it for ye would have my [love]  alone?<br/>Why, take it all: lo, have it every deal,<br/>Peter!  shrew you but ye love it well<br/>For if I woulde sell my belle chose,<br/>I coulde walk as fresh as is a rose,<br/>But I will keep it for your owen tooth.<br/>Ye be to blame, by God, I say you sooth."<br/>Such manner wordes hadde we on hand.<br/><br/>Now will I speaken of my fourth husband.<br/>My fourthe husband was a revellour;<br/>This is to say, he had a paramour,<br/>And I was young and full of ragerie,<br/>Stubborn and strong, and jolly as a pie.<br/>Then could I dance to a harpe smale,<br/>And sing, y-wis, as any nightingale,<br/>When I had drunk a draught of sweete wine.<br/>Metellius, the foule churl, the swine,<br/>That with a staff bereft his wife of life<br/>For she drank wine, though I had been his wife,<br/>Never should he have daunted me from drink:<br/>And, after wine, of Venus most I think.<br/>For all so sure as cold engenders hail,<br/>A liquorish mouth must have a liquorish tail.<br/>In woman vinolent is no defence,<br/>This knowe lechours by experience.<br/>But, lord Christ, when that it rememb'reth me<br/>Upon my youth, and on my jollity,<br/>It tickleth me about mine hearte-root;<br/>Unto this day it doth mine hearte boot,<br/>That I have had my world as in my time.<br/>But age, alas! that all will envenime,<br/>Hath me bereft my beauty and my pith:<br/>Let go; farewell; the devil go therewith.<br/>The flour is gon, there is no more to tell,<br/>The bran, as I best may, now must I sell.<br/>But yet to be right merry will I fand.<br/>Now forth to tell you of my fourth husband,<br/>I say, I in my heart had great despite,<br/>That he of any other had delight;<br/>But he was quit, by God and by Saint Joce:<br/>I made for him of the same wood a cross;<br/>Not of my body in no foul mannere,<br/>But certainly I made folk such cheer,<br/>That in his owen grease I made him fry<br/>For anger, and for very jealousy.<br/>By God, in earth I was his purgatory,<br/>For which I hope his soul may be in glory.<br/>For, God it wot, he sat full oft and sung,<br/>When that his shoe full bitterly him wrung.<br/>There was no wight, save God and he, that wist<br/>In many wise how sore I did him twist.<br/>He died when I came from Jerusalem,<br/>And lies in grave under the roode beam:<br/>Although his tomb is not so curious<br/>As was the sepulchre of Darius,<br/>Which that Apelles wrought so subtlely.<br/>It is but waste to bury them preciously.<br/>Let him fare well, God give his soule rest,<br/>He is now in his grave and in his chest.<br/><br/>Now of my fifthe husband will I tell:<br/>God let his soul never come into hell.<br/>And yet was he to me the moste shrew;<br/>That feel I on my ribbes all by rew,<br/>And ever shall, until mine ending day.<br/>But in our bed he was so fresh and gay,<br/>And therewithal so well he could me glose,<br/>When that he woulde have my belle chose,<br/>Though he had beaten me on every bone,<br/>Yet could he win again my love anon.<br/>I trow, I lov'd him better, for that he<br/>Was of his love so dangerous to me.<br/>We women have, if that I shall not lie,<br/>In this matter a quainte fantasy.<br/>Whatever thing we may not lightly have,<br/>Thereafter will we cry all day and crave.<br/>Forbid us thing, and that desire we;<br/>Press on us fast, and thenne will we flee.<br/>With danger utter we all our chaffare;<br/>Great press at market maketh deare ware,<br/>And too great cheap is held at little price;<br/>This knoweth every woman that is wise.<br/>My fifthe husband, God his soule bless,<br/>Which that I took for love and no richess,<br/>He some time was a clerk of Oxenford,<br/>And had left school, and went at home to board<br/>With my gossip, dwelling in oure town:<br/>God have her soul, her name was Alisoun.<br/>She knew my heart, and all my privity,<br/>Bet than our parish priest, so may I the.<br/>To her betrayed I my counsel all;<br/>For had my husband pissed on a wall,<br/>Or done a thing that should have cost his life,<br/>To her, and to another worthy wife,<br/>And to my niece, which that I loved well,<br/>I would have told his counsel every deal.<br/>And so I did full often, God it wot,<br/>That made his face full often red and hot<br/>For very shame, and blam'd himself, for he<br/>Had told to me so great a privity.<br/>And so befell that ones in a Lent<br/>(So oftentimes I to my gossip went,<br/>For ever yet I loved to be gay,<br/>And for to walk in March, April, and May<br/>From house to house, to heare sundry tales),<br/>That Jenkin clerk, and my gossip, Dame Ales,<br/>And I myself, into the fieldes went.<br/>Mine husband was at London all that Lent;<br/>I had the better leisure for to play,<br/>And for to see, and eke for to be sey<br/>Of lusty folk; what wist I where my grace<br/>Was shapen for to be, or in what place?<br/>Therefore made I my visitations<br/>To vigilies, and to processions,<br/>To preachings eke, and to these pilgrimages,<br/>To plays of miracles, and marriages,<br/>And weared upon me gay scarlet gites.<br/>These wormes, nor these mothes, nor these mites<br/>On my apparel frett them never a deal<br/>And know'st thou why? for they were used well.<br/>Now will I telle forth what happen'd me:<br/>I say, that in the fieldes walked we,<br/>Till truely we had such dalliance,<br/>This clerk and I, that of my purveyance<br/>I spake to him, and told him how that he,<br/>If I were widow, shoulde wedde me.<br/>For certainly, I say for no bobance,<br/>Yet was I never without purveyance<br/>Of marriage, nor of other thinges eke:<br/>I hold a mouse's wit not worth a leek,<br/>That hath but one hole for to starte to,<br/>And if that faile, then is all y-do.<br/>[I bare him on hand he had enchanted me<br/>(My dame taughte me that subtilty);<br/>And eke I said, I mette of him all night,<br/>He would have slain me, as I lay upright,<br/>And all my bed was full of very blood;<br/>But yet I hop'd that he should do me good;<br/>For blood betoken'd gold, as me was taught.<br/>And all was false, I dream'd of him right naught,<br/>But as I follow'd aye my dame's lore,<br/>As well of that as of other things more.]<br/>But now, sir, let me see, what shall I sayn?<br/>Aha! by God, I have my tale again.<br/>When that my fourthe husband was on bier,<br/>I wept algate and made a sorry cheer,<br/>As wives must, for it is the usage;<br/>And with my kerchief covered my visage;<br/>But, for I was provided with a make,<br/>I wept but little, that I undertake<br/>To churche was mine husband borne a-morrow<br/>With neighebours that for him made sorrow,<br/>And Jenkin, oure clerk, was one of tho:<br/>As help me God, when that I saw him go<br/>After the bier, methought he had a pair<br/>Of legges and of feet so clean and fair,<br/>That all my heart I gave unto his hold.<br/>He was, I trow, a twenty winter old,<br/>And I was forty, if I shall say sooth,<br/>But yet I had always a colte's tooth.<br/>Gat-toothed I was, and that became me well,<br/>I had the print of Sainte Venus' seal.<br/>[As help me God, I was a lusty one,<br/>And fair, and rich, and young, and well begone:<br/>For certes I am all venerian<br/>In feeling, and my heart is martian;<br/>Venus me gave my lust and liquorishness,<br/>And Mars gave me my sturdy hardiness.]<br/>Mine ascendant was Taure, and Mars therein:<br/>Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!<br/>I follow'd aye mine inclination<br/>By virtue of my constellation:<br/>That made me that I coulde not withdraw<br/>My chamber of Venus from a good fellaw.<br/>[Yet have I Marte's mark upon my face,<br/>And also in another privy place.<br/>For God so wisly be my salvation,<br/>I loved never by discretion,<br/>But ever follow'd mine own appetite,<br/>All were he short, or long, or black, or white,<br/>I took no keep, so that he liked me,<br/>How poor he was, neither of what degree.]<br/>What should I say? but that at the month's end<br/>This jolly clerk Jenkin, that was so hend,<br/>Had wedded me with great solemnity,<br/>And to him gave I all the land and fee<br/>That ever was me given therebefore:<br/>But afterward repented me full sore.<br/>He woulde suffer nothing of my list.<br/>By God, he smote me ones with his fist,<br/>For that I rent out of his book a leaf,<br/>That of the stroke mine eare wax'd all deaf.<br/>Stubborn I was, as is a lioness,<br/>And of my tongue a very jangleress,<br/>And walk I would, as I had done beforn,<br/>From house to house, although he had it sworn:<br/>For which he oftentimes woulde preach<br/>And me of olde Roman gestes teach<br/>How that Sulpitius Gallus left his wife<br/>And her forsook for term of all his<br/>For nought but open-headed he her say<br/>Looking out at his door upon a day.<br/>Another Roman  told he me by name,<br/>That, for his wife was at a summer game<br/>Without his knowing, he forsook her eke.<br/>And then would he upon his Bible seek<br/>That ilke proverb of Ecclesiast,<br/>Where he commandeth, and forbiddeth fast,<br/>Man shall not suffer his wife go roll about.<br/>Then would he say right thus withoute doubt:<br/>"Whoso that buildeth his house all of sallows,<br/>And pricketh his blind horse over the fallows,<br/>And suff'reth his wife to go seeke hallows,<br/>Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows."<br/>But all for nought; I sette not a haw<br/>Of his proverbs, nor of his olde saw;<br/>Nor would I not of him corrected be.<br/>I hate them that my vices telle me,<br/>And so do more of us (God wot) than I.<br/>This made him wood with me all utterly;<br/>I woulde not forbear him in no case.<br/>Now will I say you sooth, by Saint Thomas,<br/>Why that I rent out of his book a leaf,<br/>For which he smote me, so that I was deaf.<br/>He had a book, that gladly night and day<br/>For his disport he would it read alway;<br/>He call'd it Valerie, and Theophrast,<br/>And with that book he laugh'd alway full fast.<br/>And eke there was a clerk sometime at Rome,<br/>A cardinal, that highte Saint Jerome,<br/>That made a book against Jovinian,<br/>Which book was there; and eke Tertullian,<br/>Chrysippus, Trotula, and Heloise,<br/>That was an abbess not far from Paris;<br/>And eke the Parables of Solomon,<br/>Ovide's Art,  and bourdes many one;<br/>And alle these were bound in one volume.<br/>And every night and day was his custume<br/>(When he had leisure and vacation<br/>From other worldly occupation)<br/>To readen in this book of wicked wives.<br/>He knew of them more legends and more lives<br/>Than be of goodde wives in the Bible.<br/>For, trust me well, it is an impossible<br/>That any clerk will speake good of wives,<br/>(But if it be of holy saintes' lives)<br/>Nor of none other woman never the mo'.<br/>Who painted the lion, tell it me, who?<br/>By God, if women haddde written stories,<br/>As clerkes have within their oratories,<br/>They would have writ of men more wickedness<br/>Than all the mark of Adam  may redress<br/>The children of Mercury and of Venus,<br/>Be in their working full contrarious.<br/>Mercury loveth wisdom and science,<br/>And Venus loveth riot and dispence.<br/>And for their diverse disposition,<br/>Each falls in other's exaltation.<br/>As thus, God wot, Mercury is desolate<br/>In Pisces, where Venus is exaltate,<br/>And Venus falls where Mercury is raised.<br/>Therefore no woman by no clerk is praised.<br/>The clerk, when he is old, and may not do<br/>Of Venus' works not worth his olde shoe,<br/>Then sits he down, and writes in his dotage,<br/>That women cannot keep their marriage.<br/>But now to purpose, why I tolde thee<br/>That I was beaten for a book, pardie.<br/><br/>Upon a night Jenkin, that was our sire,<br/>Read on his book, as he sat by the fire,<br/>Of Eva first, that for her wickedness<br/>Was all mankind brought into wretchedness,<br/>For which that Jesus Christ himself was slain,<br/>That bought us with his hearte-blood again.<br/>Lo here express of women may ye find<br/>That woman was the loss of all mankind.<br/>Then read he me how Samson lost his hairs<br/>Sleeping, his leman cut them with her shears,<br/>Through whiche treason lost he both his eyen.<br/>Then read he me, if that I shall not lien,<br/>Of Hercules, and of his Dejanire,<br/>That caused him to set himself on fire.<br/>Nothing forgot he of the care and woe<br/>That Socrates had with his wives two;<br/>How Xantippe cast piss upon his head.<br/>This silly man sat still, as he were dead,<br/>He wip'd his head, and no more durst he sayn,<br/>But, "Ere the thunder stint there cometh rain."<br/>Of Phasiphae, that was queen of Crete,<br/>For shrewedness he thought the tale sweet.<br/>Fy, speak no more, it is a grisly thing,<br/>Of her horrible lust and her liking.<br/>Of Clytemnestra, for her lechery<br/>That falsely made her husband for to die,<br/>He read it with full good devotion.<br/>He told me eke, for what occasion<br/>Amphiorax at Thebes lost his life:<br/>My husband had a legend of his wife<br/>Eryphile, that for an ouche of gold<br/>Had privily unto the Greekes told,<br/>Where that her husband hid him in a place,<br/>For which he had at Thebes sorry grace.<br/>Of Luna told he me, and of Lucie;<br/>They bothe made their husbands for to die,<br/>That one for love, that other was for hate.<br/>Luna her husband on an ev'ning late<br/>Empoison'd had, for that she was his foe:<br/>Lucia liquorish lov'd her husband so,<br/>That, for he should always upon her think,<br/>She gave him such a manner love-drink,<br/>That he was dead before it were the morrow:<br/>And thus algates husbands hadde sorrow.<br/>Then told he me how one Latumeus<br/>Complained to his fellow Arius<br/>That in his garden growed such a tree,<br/>On which he said how that his wives three<br/>Hanged themselves for heart dispiteous.<br/>"O leve brother," quoth this Arius,<br/>"Give me a plant of thilke blessed tree,<br/>And in my garden planted shall it be."<br/>Of later date of wives hath he read,<br/>That some have slain their husbands in their bed,<br/>And let their lechour dight them all the night,<br/>While that the corpse lay on the floor upright:<br/>And some have driven nails into their brain,<br/>While that they slept, and thus they have them slain:<br/>Some have them given poison in their drink:<br/>He spake more harm than hearte may bethink.<br/>And therewithal he knew of more proverbs,<br/>Than in this world there groweth grass or herbs.<br/>"Better (quoth he) thine habitation<br/>Be with a lion, or a foul dragon,<br/>Than with a woman using for to chide.<br/>Better (quoth he) high in the roof abide,<br/>Than with an angry woman in the house,<br/>They be so wicked and contrarious:<br/>They hate that their husbands loven aye."<br/>He said, "A woman cast her shame away<br/>When she cast off her smock;" and farthermo',<br/>"A fair woman, but she be chaste also,<br/>Is like a gold ring in a sowe's nose.<br/>Who coulde ween, or who coulde suppose<br/>The woe that in mine heart was, and the pine?<br/>And when I saw that he would never fine<br/>To readen on this cursed book all night,<br/>All suddenly three leaves have I plight<br/>Out of his book, right as he read, and eke<br/>I with my fist so took him on the cheek,<br/>That in our fire he backward fell adown.<br/>And he up start, as doth a wood lion,<br/>And with his fist he smote me on the head,<br/>That on the floor I lay as I were dead.<br/>And when he saw how still that there I lay,<br/>He was aghast, and would have fled away,<br/>Till at the last out of my swoon I braid,<br/>"Oh, hast thou slain me, thou false thief?" I said<br/>"And for my land thus hast thou murder'd me?<br/>Ere I be dead, yet will I kisse thee."<br/>And near he came, and kneeled fair adown,<br/>And saide", "Deare sister Alisoun,<br/>As help me God, I shall thee never smite:<br/>That I have done it is thyself to wite,<br/>Forgive it me, and that I thee beseek."<br/>And yet eftsoons I hit him on the cheek,<br/>And saidde, "Thief, thus much am I awreak.<br/>Now will I die, I may no longer speak."<br/><br/>But at the last, with muche care and woe<br/>We fell accorded by ourselves two:<br/>He gave me all the bridle in mine hand<br/>To have the governance of house and land,<br/>And of his tongue, and of his hand also.<br/>I made him burn his book anon right tho.<br/>And when that I had gotten unto me<br/>By mast'ry all the sovereignety,<br/>And that he said, "Mine owen true wife,<br/>Do as thee list, the term of all thy life,<br/>Keep thine honour, and eke keep mine estate;<br/>After that day we never had debate.<br/>God help me so, I was to him as kind<br/>As any wife from Denmark unto Ind,<br/>And also true, and so was he to me:<br/>I pray to God that sits in majesty<br/>So bless his soule, for his mercy dear.<br/>Now will I say my tale, if ye will hear. --<br/><br/>The Friar laugh'd when he had heard all this:<br/>"Now, Dame," quoth he, "so have I joy and bliss,<br/>This is a long preamble of a tale."<br/>And when the Sompnour heard the Friar gale,<br/>"Lo," quoth this Sompnour, "Godde's armes two,<br/>A friar will intermete him evermo':<br/>Lo, goode men, a fly and eke a frere<br/>Will fall in ev'ry dish and eke mattere.<br/>What speak'st thou of perambulation?<br/>What? amble or trot; or peace, or go sit down:<br/>Thou lettest our disport in this mattere."<br/>"Yea, wilt thou so, Sir Sompnour?" quoth the Frere;<br/>"Now by my faith I shall, ere that I go,<br/>Tell of a Sompnour such a tale or two,<br/>That all the folk shall laughen in this place."<br/>"Now do, else, Friar, I beshrew thy face,"<br/>Quoth this Sompnour; "and I beshrewe me,<br/>But if I telle tales two or three<br/>Of friars, ere I come to Sittingbourne,<br/>That I shall make thine hearte for to mourn:<br/>For well I wot thy patience is gone."<br/>Our Hoste cried, "Peace, and that anon;"<br/>And saide, "Let the woman tell her tale.<br/>Ye fare as folk that drunken be of ale.<br/>Do, Dame, tell forth your tale, and that is best."<br/>"All ready, sir," quoth she, "right as you lest,<br/>If I have licence of this worthy Frere."<br/>"Yes, Dame," quoth he, "tell forth, and I will hear."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>In olde dayes of the king Arthour,<br/>Of which that Britons speake great honour,<br/>All was this land full fill'd of faerie;<br/>The Elf-queen, with her jolly company,<br/>Danced full oft in many a green mead<br/>This was the old opinion, as I read;<br/>I speak of many hundred years ago;<br/>But now can no man see none elves mo',<br/>For now the great charity and prayeres<br/>Of limitours, and other holy freres,<br/>That search every land and ev'ry stream<br/>As thick as motes in the sunne-beam,<br/>Blessing halls, chambers, kitchenes, and  bowers,<br/>Cities and burghes, castles high and towers,<br/>Thorpes and barnes, shepens and dairies,<br/>This makes that there be now no faeries:<br/>For there as wont to walke was an elf,<br/>There walketh now the limitour himself,<br/>In undermeles and in morrowings,<br/>And saith his matins and his holy things,<br/>As he goes in his limitatioun.<br/>Women may now go safely up and down,<br/>In every bush, and under every tree;<br/>There is none other incubus  but he;<br/>And he will do to them no dishonour.<br/><br/>And so befell it, that this king Arthour<br/>Had in his house a lusty bacheler,<br/>That on a day came riding from river:<br/>And happen'd, that, alone as she was born,<br/>He saw a maiden walking him beforn,<br/>Of which maiden anon, maugre her head,<br/>By very force he reft her maidenhead:<br/>For which oppression was such clamour,<br/>And such pursuit unto the king Arthour,<br/>That damned was this knight for to be dead<br/>By course of law, and should have lost his head;<br/>(Paraventure such was the statute tho),<br/>But that the queen and other ladies mo'<br/>So long they prayed the king of his grace,<br/>Till he his life him granted in the place,<br/>And gave him to the queen, all at her will<br/>To choose whether she would him save or spill<br/>The queen thanked the king with all her might;<br/>And, after this, thus spake she to the knight,<br/>When that she saw her time upon a day.<br/>"Thou standest yet," quoth she, "in such array,<br/>That of thy life yet hast thou no surety;<br/>I grant thee life, if thou canst tell to me<br/>What thing is it that women most desiren:<br/>Beware, and keep thy neck-bone from the iron<br/>And if thou canst not tell it me anon,<br/>Yet will I give thee leave for to gon<br/>A twelvemonth and a day, to seek and lear<br/>An answer suffisant in this mattere.<br/>And surety will I have, ere that thou pace,<br/>Thy body for to yielden in this place."<br/>Woe was the knight, and sorrowfully siked;<br/>But what? he might not do all as him liked.<br/>And at the last he chose him for to wend,<br/>And come again, right at the yeare's end,<br/>With such answer as God would him purvey:<br/>And took his leave, and wended forth his way.<br/><br/>He sought in ev'ry house and ev'ry place,<br/>Where as he hoped for to finde grace,<br/>To learne what thing women love the most:<br/>But he could not arrive in any coast,<br/>Where as he mighte find in this mattere<br/>Two creatures according in fere.<br/>Some said that women loved best richess,<br/>Some said honour, and some said jolliness,<br/>Some rich array, and some said lust a-bed,<br/>And oft time to be widow and be wed.<br/>Some said, that we are in our heart most eased<br/>When that we are y-flatter'd and y-praised.<br/>He went full nigh the sooth, I will not lie;<br/>A man shall win us best with flattery;<br/>And with attendance, and with business<br/>Be we y-limed, bothe more and less.<br/>And some men said that we do love the best<br/>For to be free, and do right as us lest,<br/>And that no man reprove us of our vice,<br/>But say that we are wise, and nothing nice,<br/>For truly there is none among us all,<br/>If any wight will claw us on the gall,<br/>That will not kick, for that he saith us sooth:<br/>Assay, and he shall find it, that so do'th.<br/>For be we never so vicious within,<br/>We will be held both wise and clean of sin.<br/>And some men said, that great delight have we<br/>For to be held stable and eke secre,<br/>And in one purpose steadfastly to dwell,<br/>And not bewray a thing that men us tell.<br/>But that tale is not worth a rake-stele.<br/>Pardie, we women canne nothing hele,<br/>Witness on Midas; will ye hear the tale?<br/>Ovid, amonges other thinges smale<br/>Saith, Midas had, under his longe hairs,<br/>Growing upon his head two ass's ears;<br/>The whiche vice he hid, as best he might,<br/>Full subtlely from every man's sight,<br/>That, save his wife, there knew of it no mo';<br/>He lov'd her most, and trusted her also;<br/>He prayed her, that to no creature<br/>She woulde tellen of his disfigure.<br/>She swore him, nay, for all the world to win,<br/>She would not do that villainy or sin,<br/>To make her husband have so foul a name:<br/>She would not tell it for her owen shame.<br/>But natheless her thoughte that she died,<br/>That she so longe should a counsel hide;<br/>Her thought it swell'd so sore about her heart<br/>That needes must some word from her astart<br/>And, since she durst not tell it unto man<br/>Down to a marish fast thereby she ran,<br/>Till she came there, her heart was all afire:<br/>And, as a bittern bumbles in the mire,<br/>She laid her mouth unto the water down<br/>"Bewray me not, thou water, with thy soun'"<br/>Quoth she, "to thee I tell it, and no mo',<br/>Mine husband hath long ass's eares two!<br/>Now is mine heart all whole; now is it out;<br/>I might no longer keep it, out of doubt."<br/>Here may ye see, though we a time abide,<br/>Yet out it must, we can no counsel hide.<br/>The remnant of the tale, if ye will hear,<br/>Read in Ovid, and there ye may it lear.<br/><br/>This knight, of whom my tale is specially,<br/>When that he saw he might not come thereby,<br/>That is to say, what women love the most,<br/>Within his breast full sorrowful was his ghost.<br/>But home he went, for he might not sojourn,<br/>The day was come, that homeward he must turn.<br/>And in his way it happen'd him to ride,<br/>In all his care, under a forest side,<br/>Where as he saw upon a dance go<br/>Of ladies four-and-twenty, and yet mo',<br/>Toward this ilke dance he drew full yern,<br/>The hope that he some wisdom there should learn;<br/>But certainly, ere he came fully there,<br/>Y-vanish'd was this dance, he knew not where;<br/>No creature saw he that bare life,<br/>Save on the green he sitting saw a wife,<br/>A fouler wight there may no man devise.<br/>Against this knight this old wife gan to rise,<br/>And said, "Sir Knight, hereforth lieth no way.<br/>Tell me what ye are seeking, by your fay.<br/>Paraventure it may the better be:<br/>These olde folk know muche thing." quoth she.<br/>My leve mother," quoth this knight, "certain,<br/>I am but dead, but if that I can sayn<br/>What thing it is that women most desire:<br/>Could ye me wiss, I would well quite your hire."<br/>"Plight me thy troth here in mine hand," quoth she,<br/>"The nexte thing that I require of thee<br/>Thou shalt it do, if it be in thy might,<br/>And I will tell it thee ere it be night."<br/>"Have here my trothe," quoth the knight; "I grant."<br/>"Thenne," quoth she, "I dare me well avaunt,<br/>Thy life is safe, for I will stand thereby,<br/>Upon my life the queen will say as I:<br/>Let see, which is the proudest of them all,<br/>That wears either a kerchief or a caul,<br/>That dare say nay to that I shall you teach.<br/>Let us go forth withoute longer speech<br/>Then rowned she a pistel in his ear,<br/>And bade him to be glad, and have no fear.<br/><br/>When they were come unto the court, this knight<br/>Said, he had held his day, as he had hight,<br/>And ready was his answer, as he said.<br/>Full many a noble wife, and many a maid,<br/>And many a widow, for that they be wise, --<br/>The queen herself sitting as a justice, --<br/>Assembled be, his answer for to hear,<br/>And afterward this knight was bid appear.<br/>To every wight commanded was silence,<br/>And that the knight should tell in audience,<br/>What thing that worldly women love the best.<br/>This knight he stood not still, as doth a beast,<br/>But to this question anon answer'd<br/>With manly voice, that all the court it heard,<br/>"My liege lady, generally," quoth he,<br/>"Women desire to have the sovereignty<br/>As well over their husband as their love<br/>And for to be in mast'ry him above.<br/>This is your most desire, though ye me kill,<br/>Do as you list, I am here at your will."<br/>In all the court there was no wife nor maid<br/>Nor widow, that contraried what he said,<br/>But said, he worthy was to have his life.<br/>And with that word up start that olde wife<br/>Which that the knight saw sitting on the green.<br/><br/>"Mercy," quoth she, "my sovereign lady queen,<br/>Ere that your court departe, do me right.<br/>I taughte this answer unto this knight,<br/>For which he plighted me his trothe there,<br/>The firste thing I would of him requere,<br/>He would it do, if it lay in his might.<br/>Before this court then pray I thee, Sir Knight,"<br/>Quoth she, "that thou me take unto thy wife,<br/>For well thou know'st that I have kept thy life.<br/>If I say false, say nay, upon thy fay."<br/>This knight answer'd, "Alas, and well-away!<br/>I know right well that such was my behest.<br/>For Godde's love choose a new request<br/>Take all my good, and let my body go."<br/>"Nay, then," quoth she, "I shrew us bothe two,<br/>For though that I be old, and foul, and poor,<br/>I n'ould for all the metal nor the ore,<br/>That under earth is grave, or lies above<br/>But if thy wife I were and eke thy love."<br/>"My love?" quoth he, "nay, my damnation,<br/>Alas! that any of my nation<br/>Should ever so foul disparaged be.<br/>But all for nought; the end is this, that he<br/>Constrained was, that needs he muste wed,<br/>And take this olde wife, and go to bed.<br/><br/>Now woulde some men say paraventure<br/>That for my negligence I do no cure<br/>To tell you all the joy and all th' array<br/>That at the feast was made that ilke day.<br/>To which thing shortly answeren I shall:<br/>I say there was no joy nor feast at all,<br/>There was but heaviness and muche sorrow:<br/>For privily he wed her on the morrow;<br/>And all day after hid him as an owl,<br/>So woe was him, his wife look'd so foul<br/>Great was the woe the knight had in his thought<br/>When he was with his wife to bed y-brought;<br/>He wallow'd, and he turned to and fro.<br/>This olde wife lay smiling evermo',<br/>And said, "Dear husband, benedicite,<br/>Fares every knight thus with his wife as ye?<br/>Is this the law of king Arthoures house?<br/>Is every knight of his thus dangerous?<br/>I am your owen love, and eke your wife<br/>I am she, which that saved hath your life<br/>And certes yet did I you ne'er unright.<br/>Why fare ye thus with me this firste night?<br/>Ye fare like a man had lost his wit.<br/>What is my guilt? for God's love tell me it,<br/>And it shall be amended, if I may."<br/>"Amended!" quoth this knight; "alas, nay, nay,<br/>It will not be amended, never mo';<br/>Thou art so loathly, and so old also,<br/>And thereto comest of so low a kind,<br/>That little wonder though I wallow and wind;<br/>So woulde God, mine hearte woulde brest!"<br/>"Is this," quoth she, "the cause of your unrest?"<br/>"Yea, certainly," quoth he; "no wonder is."<br/>"Now, Sir," quoth she, "I could amend all this,<br/>If that me list, ere it were dayes three,<br/>So well ye mighte bear you unto me.<br/>But, for ye speaken of such gentleness<br/>As is descended out of old richess,<br/>That therefore shalle ye be gentlemen;<br/>Such arrogancy is not worth a hen.<br/>Look who that is most virtuous alway,<br/>Prive and apert, and most intendeth aye<br/>To do the gentle deedes that he can;<br/>And take him for the greatest gentleman.<br/>Christ will, we claim of him our gentleness,<br/>Not of our elders for their old richess.<br/>For though they gave us all their heritage,<br/>For which we claim to be of high parage,<br/>Yet may they not bequeathe, for no thing,<br/>To none of us, their virtuous living<br/>That made them gentlemen called to be,<br/>And bade us follow them in such degree.<br/>Well can the wise poet of Florence,<br/>That highte Dante, speak of this sentence:<br/>Lo, in such manner rhyme is Dante's tale.<br/>'Full seld' upriseth by his branches smale<br/>Prowess of man, for God of his goodness<br/>Wills that we claim of him our gentleness;'<br/>For of our elders may we nothing claim<br/>But temp'ral things that man may hurt and maim.<br/>Eke every wight knows this as well as I,<br/>If gentleness were planted naturally<br/>Unto a certain lineage down the line,<br/>Prive and apert, then would they never fine<br/>To do of gentleness the fair office<br/>Then might they do no villainy nor vice.<br/>Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house<br/>Betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus,<br/>And let men shut the doores, and go thenne,<br/>Yet will the fire as fair and lighte brenne<br/>As twenty thousand men might it behold;<br/>Its office natural aye will it hold,<br/>On peril of my life, till that it die.<br/>Here may ye see well how that gentery<br/>Is not annexed to possession,<br/>Since folk do not their operation<br/>Alway, as doth the fire, lo, in its kind<br/>For, God it wot, men may full often find<br/>A lorde's son do shame and villainy.<br/>And he that will have price of his gent'ry,<br/>For he was boren of a gentle house,<br/>And had his elders noble and virtuous,<br/>And will himselfe do no gentle deedes,<br/>Nor follow his gentle ancestry, that dead is,<br/>He is not gentle, be he duke or earl;<br/>For villain sinful deedes make a churl.<br/>For gentleness is but the renomee<br/>Of thine ancestors, for their high bounte,<br/>Which is a strange thing to thy person:<br/>Thy gentleness cometh from God alone.<br/>Then comes our very gentleness of grace;<br/>It was no thing bequeath'd us with our place.<br/>Think how noble, as saith Valerius,<br/>Was thilke Tullius Hostilius,<br/>That out of povert' rose to high<br/>Read in Senec, and read eke in Boece,<br/>There shall ye see express, that it no drede is,<br/>That he is gentle that doth gentle deedes.<br/>And therefore, leve husband, I conclude,<br/>Albeit that mine ancestors were rude,<br/>Yet may the highe God, -- and so hope I, --<br/>Grant me His grace to live virtuously:<br/>Then am I gentle when that I begin<br/>To live virtuously, and waive sin.<br/><br/>"And whereas ye of povert' me repreve,<br/>The highe God, on whom that we believe,<br/>In wilful povert' chose to lead his life:<br/>And certes, every man, maiden, or wife<br/>May understand that Jesus, heaven's king,<br/>Ne would not choose a virtuous living.<br/>Glad povert' is an honest thing, certain;<br/>This will Senec and other clerkes sayn<br/>Whoso that holds him paid of his povert',<br/>I hold him rich though he hath not a shirt.<br/>He that coveteth is a poore wight<br/>For he would have what is not in his might<br/>But he that nought hath, nor coveteth to have,<br/>Is rich, although ye hold him but a knave.<br/>Very povert' is sinne, properly.<br/>Juvenal saith of povert' merrily:<br/>The poore man, when he goes by the way<br/>Before the thieves he may sing and play<br/>Povert' is hateful good, and, as I guess,<br/>A full great bringer out of business;<br/>A great amender eke of sapience<br/>To him that taketh it in patience.<br/>Povert' is this, although it seem elenge<br/>Possession that no wight will challenge<br/>Povert' full often, when a man is low,<br/>Makes him his God and eke himself to know<br/>Povert' a spectacle is, as thinketh me<br/>Through which he may his very friendes see.<br/>And, therefore, Sir, since that I you not grieve,<br/>Of my povert' no more me repreve.<br/>"Now, Sir, of elde ye repreve me:<br/>And certes, Sir, though none authority<br/>Were in no book, ye gentles of honour<br/>Say, that men should an olde wight honour,<br/>And call him father, for your gentleness;<br/>And authors shall I finden, as I guess.<br/>Now there ye say that I am foul and old,<br/>Then dread ye not to be a cokewold.<br/>For filth, and elde, all so may I the,<br/>Be greate wardens upon chastity.<br/>But natheless, since I know your delight,<br/>I shall fulfil your wordly appetite.<br/>Choose now," quoth she, "one of these thinges tway,<br/>To have me foul and old till that I dey,<br/>And be to you a true humble wife,<br/>And never you displease in all my life:<br/>Or elles will ye have me young and fair,<br/>And take your aventure of the repair<br/>That shall be to your house because of me, --<br/>Or in some other place, it may well be?<br/>Now choose yourselfe whether that you liketh.<br/><br/>This knight adviseth him and sore he siketh,<br/>But at the last he said in this mannere;<br/>"My lady and my love, and wife so dear,<br/>I put me in your wise governance,<br/>Choose for yourself which may be most pleasance<br/>And most honour to you and me also;<br/>I do no force the whether of the two:<br/>For as you liketh, it sufficeth me."<br/>"Then have I got the mastery," quoth she,<br/>"Since I may choose and govern as me lest."<br/>"Yea, certes wife," quoth he, "I hold it best."<br/>"Kiss me," quoth she, "we are no longer wroth,<br/>For by my troth I will be to you both;<br/>This is to say, yea, bothe fair and good.<br/>I pray to God that I may sterve wood,<br/>But I to you be all so good and true,<br/>As ever was wife since the world was new;<br/>And but I be to-morrow as fair to seen,<br/>As any lady, emperess or queen,<br/>That is betwixt the East and eke the West<br/>Do with my life and death right as you lest.<br/>Cast up the curtain, and look how it is."<br/><br/>And when the knight saw verily all this,<br/>That she so fair was, and so young thereto,<br/>For joy he hent her in his armes two:<br/>His hearte bathed in a bath of bliss,<br/>A thousand times on row he gan her kiss:<br/>And she obeyed him in every thing<br/>That mighte do him pleasance or liking.<br/>And thus they live unto their lives' end<br/>In  perfect joy; and Jesus Christ us send<br/>Husbandes meek and young, and fresh in bed,<br/>And grace to overlive them that we wed.<br/>And eke I pray Jesus to short their lives,<br/>That will not be governed by their wives.<br/>And old and angry niggards of dispence,<br/>God send them soon a very pestilence!
