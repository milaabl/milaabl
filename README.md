# üíÆ Starting from Paumanok. by *Walt Whitman*

<p>
    1<br/>STARTING from fish-shape Paumanok, where I was born,<br/>Well-begotten, and rais‚Äôd by a perfect mother;<br/>After roaming many lands‚Äîlover of populous pavements;<br/>Dweller in Mannahatta, my city‚Äîor on southern savannas;<br/>Or a soldier camp‚Äôd, or carrying my knapsack and gun‚Äîor a miner in<br/>  California;<br/>Or rude in my home in Dakota‚Äôs woods, my diet meat, my drink from the<br/>  spring;<br/>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,<br/>Far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, rapt and happy;<br/>Aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing Missouri‚Äîaware of mighty<br/>  Niagara;<br/>Aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains‚Äîthe hirsute and<br/>  strong-breasted bull;<br/>Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers, experienced‚Äîstars, rain, snow, my<br/>  amaze;<br/>Having studied the mocking-bird‚Äôs tones, and the mountainhawk‚Äôs,<br/>And heard at dusk the unrival‚Äôd one, the hermit thrush from the<br/>  swamp-cedars,<br/>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.<br/><br/>2Victory, union, faith, identity, time,<br/>The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,<br/>Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.<br/><br/>This, then, is life;<br/>Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.<br/><br/>How curious! how real!<br/>Underfoot the divine soil‚Äîoverhead the sun.<br/><br/>See, revolving, the globe;<br/>The ancestor-continents, away, group‚Äôd together;<br/>The present and future continents, north and south, with the isthmus between.<br/><br/>See, vast, trackless spaces;<br/>As in a dream, they change, they swiftly fill;<br/>Countless masses debouch upon them;<br/>They are now cover‚Äôd with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.<br/><br/>See, projected, through time,<br/>For me, an audience interminable.<br/><br/>With firm and regular step they wend‚Äîthey never stop,<br/>Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions;<br/>One generation playing its part, and passing on;<br/>Another generation playing its part, and passing on in its turn,<br/>With faces turn‚Äôd sideways or backward towards me, to listen,<br/>With eyes retrospective towards me,<br/><br/>3Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian;<br/>Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!<br/>For you a programme of chants.<br/><br/>Chants of the prairies;<br/>Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea;<br/>Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota;<br/>Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence, equi-distant,<br/>Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.<br/><br/>4In the Year 80 of The States,<br/>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form‚Äôd from this soil, this air,<br/>Born here of parents born here, from parents the same, and their parents the<br/>  same,<br/>I, now thirty-six years old, in perfect health, begin,<br/>Hoping to cease not till death.<br/><br/>Creeds and schools in abeyance,<br/>(Retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,)<br/>I harbor, for good or bad‚ÄîI permit to speak, at every hazard,<br/>Nature now without check, with original energy.<br/><br/>5Take my leaves, America! take them, South, and take them, North!<br/>Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own offspring;<br/>Surround them, East and West! for they would surround you;<br/>And you precedents! connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly with<br/>  you.<br/><br/>I conn‚Äôd old times;<br/>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br/>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might return and study me!<br/><br/>In the name of These States, shall I scorn the antique?<br/>Why These are the children of the antique, to justify it.<br/><br/>6Dead poets, philosophs, priests,<br/>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,<br/>Language-shapers, on other shores,<br/>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br/>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left, wafted hither:<br/><br/>I have perused it‚Äîown it is admirable, (moving awhile among it;)<br/>Think nothing can ever be greater‚Äînothing can ever deserve more than it<br/>  deserves;<br/>Regarding it all intently a long while‚Äîthen dismissing it,<br/>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.<br/><br/>Here lands female and male;<br/>Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world‚Äîhere the flame of<br/>  materials;<br/>Here Spirituality, the translatress, the openly-avow‚Äôd,<br/>The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms;<br/>The satisfier, after due long-waiting, now advancing,<br/>Yes, here comes my mistress, the Soul.<br/><br/>7The SOUL:<br/>Forever and forever‚Äîlonger than soil is brown and solid‚Äîlonger than<br/>  water ebbs and flows.<br/><br/>I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most<br/>  spiritual poems;<br/>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,<br/>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my Soul, and of<br/>  immortality.<br/><br/>I will make a song for These States, that no-one State may under any<br/>  circumstances be subjected to another State;<br/>And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night between<br/>  all The States, and between any two of them:<br/>And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of weapons with<br/>  menacing points,<br/>And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces:<br/>‚ÄîAnd a song make I, of the One form‚Äôd out of all;<br/>The fang‚Äôd and glittering One whose head is over all;<br/>Resolute, warlike One, including and over all;<br/>(However high the head of any else, that head is over all.)<br/><br/>I will acknowledge contemporary lands;<br/>I will trail the whole geography of the globe, and salute courteously every city<br/>  large and small;<br/>And employments! I will put in my poems, that with you is heroism, upon land and<br/>  sea;<br/>And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.<br/><br/>I will sing the song of companionship;<br/>I will show what alone must finally compact These;<br/>I believe These are to found their own ideal of manly love, indicating it in me;<br/><br/>I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening to<br/>  consume me;<br/>I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires;<br/>I will give them complete abandonment;<br/>I will write the evangel-poem of comrades, and of love;<br/>(For who but I should understand love, with all its sorrow and joy?<br/>And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)<br/><br/>8I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races;<br/>I advance from the people in their own spirit;<br/>Here is what sings unrestricted faith.<br/><br/>Omnes! Omnes! let others ignore what they may;<br/>I make the poem of evil also‚ÄîI commemorate that part also;<br/>I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is‚ÄîAnd I say there is<br/>  in fact no evil;<br/>(Or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to me, as<br/>  anything else.)<br/><br/>I too, following many, and follow‚Äôd by many, inaugurate a Religion‚ÄîI<br/>  descend into the arena;<br/>(It may be I am destin‚Äôd to utter the loudest cries there, the<br/>  winner‚Äôs pealing shouts;<br/>Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)<br/><br/>Each is not for its own sake;<br/>I say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are for Religion‚Äôs<br/>  sake.<br/><br/>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough;<br/>None has ever yet adored or worship‚Äôd half enough;<br/>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is.<br/><br/><br/>I say that the real and permanent grandeur of These States must be their<br/>  Religion;<br/>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur:<br/>(Nor character, nor life worthy the name, without Religion;<br/>Nor land, nor man or woman, without Religion.)<br/><br/>9What are you doing, young man?<br/>Are you so earnest‚Äîso given up to literature, science, art, amours?<br/>These ostensible realities, politics, points?<br/>Your ambition or business, whatever it may be?<br/><br/>It is well‚ÄîAgainst such I say not a word‚ÄîI am their poet also;<br/>But behold! such swiftly subside‚Äîburnt up for Religion‚Äôs sake;<br/>For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the<br/>  earth,<br/>Any more than such are to Religion.<br/><br/>10What do you seek, so pensive and silent?<br/>What do you need, Camerado?<br/>Dear son! do you think it is love?<br/><br/>Listen, dear son‚Äîlisten, America, daughter or son!<br/>It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess‚Äîand yet it<br/>  satisfies‚Äîit is great;<br/>But there is something else very great‚Äîit makes the whole coincide;<br/>It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands, sweeps and provides<br/>  for all.<br/><br/>11Know you! solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater Religion,<br/>The following chants, each for its kind, I sing.<br/><br/>My comrade!<br/>For you, to share with me, two greatnesses‚Äîand a third one, rising<br/>  inclusive and more resplendent,<br/>The greatness of Love and Democracy‚Äîand the greatness of Religion.<br/><br/>Melange mine own! the unseen and the seen;<br/>Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;<br/>Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me;<br/>Living beings, identities, now doubtless near us, in the air, that we know not<br/>  of;<br/>Contact daily and hourly that will not release me;<br/>These selecting‚Äîthese, in hints, demanded of me.<br/><br/>Not he, with a daily kiss, onward from childhood kissing me,<br/>Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,<br/>Any more than I am held to the heavens, to the spiritual world,<br/>And to the identities of the Gods, my lovers, faithful and true,<br/>After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.<br/><br/>O such themes! Equalities!<br/>O amazement of things! O divine average!<br/>O warblings under the sun‚Äîusher‚Äôd, as now, or at noon, or setting!<br/>O strain, musical, flowing through ages‚Äînow reaching hither!<br/>I take to your reckless and composite chords‚ÄîI add to them, and cheerfully<br/>  pass them forward.<br/><br/>12As I have walk‚Äôd in Alabama my morning walk,<br/>I have seen where the she-bird, the mocking-bird, sat on her nest in the briers,<br/>  hatching her brood.<br/><br/>I have seen the he-bird also;<br/>I have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully<br/>  singing.<br/><br/>And while I paused, it came to me that what he really sang for was not there<br/>  only,<br/>Nor for his mate, nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes;<br/>But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,<br/>A charge transmitted, and gift occult, for those being born.<br/><br/>13Democracy!<br/>Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.<br/><br/>Ma femme!<br/>For the brood beyond us and of us,<br/>For those who belong here, and those to come,<br/>I, exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger and<br/>  haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.<br/><br/>I will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,<br/>And your songs, outlaw‚Äôd offenders‚Äîfor I scan you with kindred eyes,<br/>  and carry you with me the same as any.<br/><br/>I will make the true poem of riches,<br/>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and is not<br/>  dropt by death.<br/><br/>I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all‚Äîand I will be the bard of<br/>  personality;<br/>And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other;<br/>And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me‚Äîfor I am<br/>  determin‚Äôd to tell you with courageous clear voice, to prove you<br/>  illustrious;<br/>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present‚Äîand can be<br/>  none in the future;<br/>And I will show that whatever happens to anybody, it may be turn‚Äôd to<br/>  beautiful results‚Äîand I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful<br/>  than death;<br/>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact,<br/>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound<br/>  as any.<br/><br/>I will not make poems with reference to parts;<br/>But I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts with reference to<br/>  ensemble:<br/>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days;<br/>And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference to<br/>  the Soul;<br/>(Because, having look‚Äôd at the objects of the universe, I find there is no<br/>  one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the Soul.)<br/><br/>14Was somebody asking to see the Soul?<br/>See! your own shape and countenance‚Äîpersons, substances, beasts, the trees,<br/>  the running rivers, the rocks and sands.<br/><br/>All hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them:<br/>How can the real body ever die, and be buried?<br/><br/>Of your real body, and any man‚Äôs or woman‚Äôs real body,<br/>Item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners, and pass to<br/>  fitting spheres,<br/>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death.<br/><br/>Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the meaning, the<br/>  main concern,<br/>Any more than a man‚Äôs substance and life, or a woman‚Äôs substance and<br/>  life, return in the body and the Soul,<br/>Indifferently before death and after death.<br/><br/>Behold! the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern‚Äîand includes<br/>  and is the Soul;<br/>Whoever you are! how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it.<br/><br/>15Whoever you are! to you endless announcements.<br/><br/>Daughter of the lands, did you wait for your poet?<br/>Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?<br/><br/>Toward the male of The States, and toward the female of The States,<br/>Live words‚Äîwords to the lands.<br/><br/>O the lands! interlink‚Äôd, food-yielding lands!<br/>Land of coal and iron! Land of gold! Lands of cotton, sugar, rice!<br/>Land of wheat, beef, pork! Land of wool and hemp! Land of the apple and grape!<br/>Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! Land of those<br/>  sweet-air‚Äôd interminable plateaus!<br/>Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!<br/>Lands where the northwest Columbia winds, and where the southwest Colorado<br/>  winds!<br/>Land of the eastern Chesapeake!

O I at any rate include<br/>  you all with perfect love!<br/>I cannot be discharged from you! not from one, any sooner than another!<br/>O Death! O for all that, I am yet of you, unseen, this hour, with irrepressible<br/>  love,<br/>Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,<br/>Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples, on Paumanok‚Äôs<br/>  sands,<br/>Crossing the prairies‚Äîdwelling again in Chicago‚Äîdwelling in every<br/>  town,<br/>Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,<br/>Listening to the orators and the oratresses in public halls,<br/>Of and through The States, as during life‚Äîeach man and woman my neighbor,<br/>The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to him and her,<br/>The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me‚Äîand I yet with any of them;<br/>Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river‚Äîyet in my house of adobie,<br/>Yet returning eastward‚Äîyet in the Sea-Side State, or in Maryland,<br/>Yet Kanadian, cheerily braving the winter‚Äîthe snow and ice welcome to me,<br/>Yet a true son either of Maine, or of the Granite State, or of the Narragansett<br/>  Bay State, or of the Empire State;<br/>Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same‚Äîyet welcoming every new<br/>  brother;<br/>Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones, from the hour they unite with the<br/>  old ones;<br/>Coming among the new ones myself, to be their companion and equal‚Äîcoming<br/>  personally to you now;<br/>Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.<br/><br/>16With me, with firm holding‚Äîyet haste, haste on.<br/><br/>For your life, adhere to me!<br/>Of all the men of the earth, I only can unloose you and toughen you;<br/>I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give myself really to<br/>  you‚Äîbut what of that?<br/>Must not Nature be persuaded many times?<br/><br/>No dainty dolce affettuoso I;<br/>Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck‚Äôd, forbidding, I have arrived,<br/>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the universe;<br/>For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.<br/><br/>17On my way a moment I pause;<br/>Here for you! and here for America!<br/>Still the Present I raise aloft‚ÄîStill the Future of The States I harbinge,<br/>  glad and sublime;<br/>And for the Past, I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines.<br/><br/>The red aborigines!<br/>Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds and animals<br/>  in the woods, syllabled to us for names;<br/>Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee, Kaqueta,<br/>  Oronoco,<br/>Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-Walla;<br/>Leaving such to The States, they melt, they depart, charging the water and the<br/>  land with names.<br/><br/>18O expanding and swift! O henceforth,<br/>Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, and audacious;<br/>A world primal again‚ÄîVistas of glory, incessant and branching;<br/>A new race, dominating previous ones, and grander far‚Äîwith new contests,<br/>New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts.<br/><br/>These! my voice announcing‚ÄîI will sleep no more, but arise;<br/>You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you, fathomless, stirring,<br/>  preparing unprecedented waves and storms.<br/><br/>19See! steamers steaming through my poems!<br/>See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing;<br/>See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter‚Äôs hut, the flatboat, the<br/>  maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village;<br/>See, on the one side the Western Sea, and on the other the Eastern Sea, how they<br/>  advance and retreat upon my poems, as upon their own shores.<br/><br/>See, pastures and forests in my poems‚ÄîSee, animals, wild and tame‚ÄîSee,<br/>  beyond the Kanzas, countless herds of buffalo, feeding on short curly grass;<br/>See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets, with iron and<br/>  stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce;<br/>See, the many-cylinder‚Äôd steam printing-press‚ÄîSee, the electric<br/>  telegraph, stretching across the Continent, from the Western Sea to Manhattan;<br/>See, through Atlantica‚Äôs depths, pulses American, Europe<br/>  reaching‚Äîpulses of Europe, duly return‚Äôd;<br/>See, the strong and quick locomotive, as it departs, panting, blowing the<br/>  steam-whistle;<br/>See, ploughmen, ploughing farms‚ÄîSee, miners, digging mines‚ÄîSee, the<br/>  numberless factories;<br/>See, mechanics, busy at their benches, with tools‚ÄîSee from among them,<br/>  superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in working dresses;<br/>See, lounging through the shops and fields of The States, me, well-belov‚Äôd,<br/>  close-held by day and night;<br/>Hear the loud echoes of my songs there! Read the hints come at last.<br/><br/>20O Camerado close!<br/>O you and me at last‚Äîand us two only.<br/><br/>O a word to clear one‚Äôs path ahead endlessly!<br/>O something extatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!<br/><br/>O now I triumph‚Äîand you shall also;<br/>O hand in hand‚ÄîO wholesome pleasure‚ÄîO one more desirer and lover!<br/>O to haste, firm holding‚Äîto haste, haste on with me.
