# üíÆ Hymn to Proserpine (After the Proclamation of the Christian by *Algernon Charles Swinburne*

<p>
    Vicisti, Galil√¶e<br/>I have lived long enough, having seen one thing, that love hath an end;<br/>Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend.<br/>Thou art more than the day or the morrow, the seasons that laugh or that weep;<br/>For these give joy and sorrow; but thou, Proserpina, sleep.<br/>Sweet is the treading of wine, and sweet the feet of the dove;<br/>But a goodlier gift is thine than foam of the grapes or love.<br/>Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold,<br/>A bitter God to follow, a beautiful God to behold?<br/>I am sick of singing; the bays burn deep and chafe: I am fain<br/>To rest a little from praise and grievous pleasure and pain.<br/>For the Gods we know not of, who give us our daily breath,<br/>We know they are cruel as love or life, and lovely as death.<br/>O Gods dethroned and deceased, cast forth, wiped out in a day!<br/>From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say.<br/>New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods;<br/>They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate Gods.<br/>But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare;<br/>Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were.<br/>Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof,<br/>Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love.<br/>I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at peace,<br/>Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease.<br/>Wilt thou take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take,<br/>The laurel, the palms and the paean, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake;<br/>Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath;<br/>And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death;<br/>All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre,<br/>Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire.<br/>More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things?<br/>Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings.<br/>A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may?<br/>For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day.<br/>And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears:<br/>Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years?<br/>Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;<br/>We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.<br/>Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day;<br/>But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May.<br/>Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end;<br/>For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend.<br/>Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides;<br/>But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides.<br/>O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods!<br/>O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!<br/>Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend,<br/>I kneel not neither adore you, but standing, look to the end.<br/>All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast<br/>Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past:<br/>Where beyond the extreme sea-wall, and between the remote sea-gates,<br/>Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits:<br/>Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings,<br/>And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things,<br/>White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled,<br/>Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world.<br/>The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away;<br/>In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey;<br/>In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears;<br/>With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years:<br/>With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour;<br/>And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour:<br/>And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be;<br/>And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea:<br/>And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air:<br/>And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare.<br/>Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with rods?<br/>Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye Gods?<br/>All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past;<br/>Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last.<br/>In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things,<br/>Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings.<br/>Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers trod,<br/>Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a God,<br/>Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head,<br/>Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee dead.<br/>Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around;<br/>Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned.<br/>Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these.<br/>Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas,<br/>Clothed round with the world's desire as with raiment, and fair as the foam,<br/>And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome.<br/>For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours,<br/>Her deep hair heavily laden with odour and colour of flowers,<br/>White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendour, a flame,<br/>Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name.<br/>For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she<br/>Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea.<br/>And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways,<br/>And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays.<br/>Ye are fallen, our lords, by what token? we wise that ye should not fall.<br/>Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all.<br/>But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end;<br/>Goddess and maiden and queen, be near me now and befriend.<br/>O daughter of earth, of my mother, her crown and blossom of birth,<br/>I am also, I also, thy brother; I go as I came unto earth.<br/>In the night where thine eyes are as moons are in heaven, the night where thou art,<br/>Where the silence is more than all tunes, where sleep overflows from the heart,<br/>Where the poppies are sweet as the rose in our world, and the red rose is white,<br/>And the wind falls faint as it blows with the fume of the flowers of the night,<br/>And the murmur of spirits that sleep in the shadow of Gods from afar<br/>Grows dim in thine ears and deep as the deep dim soul of a star,<br/>In the sweet low light of thy face, under heavens untrod by the sun,<br/>Let my soul with their souls find place, and forget what is done and undone.<br/>Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal breath;<br/>Let these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death.<br/>Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I know<br/>I shall die as my fathers died, and sleep as they sleep, even so.<br/>For the glass of the years is brittle wherein we gaze for a span;<br/>A little soul for a little bears up this corpse which is man.<br/>So long I endure, no longer; and laugh not again, neither weep.<br/>For there is no God found stronger than death; and death is a sleep.
