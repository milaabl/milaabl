# üíÆ The Barn by *Edward Thomas*

<p>
    THEY should never have built a barn there, at all--<br/>Drip, drip, drip!--under that elm tree,<br/>Though then it was young. Now it is old<br/>But good, not like the barn and me.<br/><br/>To-morrow they cut it down. They will leave<br/>The barn, as I shall be left, maybe.<br/>What holds it up? 'Twould not pay to pull down.<br/>Well, this place has no other antiquity.<br/><br/>No abbey or castle looks so old<br/>As this that Job Knight built in '54,<br/>Built to keep corn for rats and men.<br/>Now there's fowls in the roof, pigs on the floor.<br/><br/>What thatch survives is dung for the grass,<br/>The best grass on the farm. A pity the roof<br/>Will not bear a mower to mow it. But<br/>Only fowls have foothold enough.<br/><br/>Starlings used to sit there with bubbling throats<br/>Making a spiky beard as they chattered<br/>And whistled and kissed, with heads in air,<br/>Till they thought of something else that mattered.<br/><br/>But now they cannot find a place,<br/>Among all those holes, for a nest any more.<br/>It's the turn of lesser things, I suppose.<br/>Once I fancied 'twas starlings they built it for.
</p>
