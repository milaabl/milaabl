<!-- Start poem -->
# üíÆ Porphyria's Lover by *Robert Browning*

<p>
    The rain set early in to-night,<br/>        The sullen wind was soon awake,<br/>It tore the elm-tops down for spite,<br/>        And did its worst to vex the lake:<br/>        I listened with heart fit to break.<br/>When glided in Porphyria; straight<br/>        She shut the cold out and the storm,<br/>And kneeled and made the cheerless grate<br/>        Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;<br/>        Which done, she rose, and from her form<br/>Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,<br/>        And laid her soiled gloves by, untied<br/>Her hat and let the damp hair fall,<br/>        And, last, she sat down by my side<br/>        And called me. When no voice replied,<br/>She put my arm about her waist,<br/>        And made her smooth white shoulder bare,<br/>And all her yellow hair displaced,<br/>        And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,<br/>        And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,<br/>Murmuring how she loved me--she<br/>        Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,<br/>To set its struggling passion free<br/>        From pride, and vainer ties dissever,<br/>        And give herself to me for ever.<br/>But passion sometimes would prevail,<br/>        Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain<br/>A sudden thought of one so pale<br/>        For love of her, and all in vain:<br/>        So, she was come through wind and rain.<br/><br/>Be sure I looked up at her eyes<br/>        Happy and proud; at last I knew<br/>Porphyria worshipped me; surprise<br/>        Made my heart swell, and still it grew<br/>        While I debated what to do.<br/>That moment she was mine, mine, fair,<br/>        Perfectly pure and good: I found<br/>A thing to do, and all her hair<br/>        In one long yellow string I wound<br/>        Three times her little throat around,<br/>And strangled her.  No pain felt she;<br/>        I am quite sure she felt no pain.<br/>As a shut bud that holds a bee,<br/>        I warily oped her lids: again<br/>        Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.<br/>And I untightened next the tress<br/>        About her neck; her cheek once more<br/>Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:<br/>        I propped her head up as before,<br/>        Only, this time my shoulder bore<br/>Her head, which droops upon it still:<br/>        The smiling rosy little head,<br/>So glad it has its utmost will,<br/>        That all it scorned at once is fled,<br/>And I, its love, am gained instead!<br/>Porphyria's love: she guessed not how<br/>        Her darling one wish would be heard.<br/>And thus we sit together now,<br/>        And all night long we have not stirred,<br/>        And yet God has not said a word!
