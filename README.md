# üíÆ The First Kiss of Love by *George Gordon, Lord Byron*

<p>
      Ha barbitos de chordais<br/>  Er_ota mounon aechei.  - Anacreon<br/><br/>Away with your fictions of flimsy romance,<br/>  Those tissues of falsehood which Folly has wove;<br/>Give me the mild beam of the soul-breathing glance,<br/>  Or the rapture which dwells on the first kiss of love.<br/><br/>Ye rhymers, whose bosoms with fantasy glow, <br/>  Whose pastoral passions are made for the grove;<br/>From what blest inspiration your sonnets would flow, <br/>  Could you ever have tasted the first kiss of love.<br/><br/>If Apollo should e'er his assistance refuse,<br/>  Or the Nine be dispos'd from your service to rove,<br/>Invoke them no more, bid adieu to the Muse,<br/>  And try the effect, of the first kiss of love.<br/><br/>I hate you, ye cold compositions of art,<br/>  Though prudes may condemn me, and bigots reprove;<br/>I court the effusions that spring from the heart,<br/>  Which throbs, with delight, to the first kiss of love. <br/><br/>Your shepherds, your flocks, those fantastical themes, <br/>  Perhaps may amuse, yet they never can move:<br/>Arcadia displays but a region of dreams; <br/>  What are visions like these, to the first kiss of love?<br/><br/>Oh! cease to affirm that man, since his birth, <br/>  From Adam, till now, has with wretchedness strove;<br/>Some portion of Paradise still is on earth,<br/>  And Eden revives, in the first kiss of love.<br/><br/>When age chills the blood, when our pleasures are past--<br/>For years fleet away with the wings of the dove--<br/>The dearest remembrance will still be the last,<br/>Our sweetest memorial, the first kiss of love.
</p>
