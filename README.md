# üíÆ Alfred Lord Tennyson - The Coming Of Arthur by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,<br/>Had one fair daughter, and none other child;<br/>And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth,<br/>Guinevere, and in her his one delight.<br/><br/>For many a petty king ere Arthur came<br/>Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war<br/>Each upon other, wasted all the land;<br/>And still from time to time the heathen host<br/>Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.<br/>And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,<br/>Wherein the beast was ever more and more,<br/>But man was less and less, till Arthur came.<br/>For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,<br/>And after him King Uther fought and died,<br/>But either failed to make the kingdom one.<br/>And after these King Arthur for a space,<br/>And through the puissance of his Table Round,<br/>Drew all their petty princedoms under him.<br/>Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.<br/><br/>And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,<br/>Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,<br/>And none or few to scare or chase the beast;<br/>So that wild dog, and wolf and boar and bear<br/>Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,<br/>And wallowed in the gardens of the King.<br/>And ever and anon the wolf would steal<br/>The children and devour, but now and then,<br/>Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat<br/>To human sucklings; and the children, housed<br/>In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,<br/>And mock their foster mother on four feet,<br/>Till, straightened, they grew up to wolf-like men,<br/>Worse than the wolves. And King Leodogran<br/>Groaned for the Roman legions here again,<br/>And Csar's eagle: then his brother king,<br/>Urien, assailed him: last a heathen horde,<br/>Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,<br/>And on the spike that split the mother's heart<br/>Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,<br/>He knew not whither he should turn for aid.<br/><br/>But--for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,<br/>Though not without an uproar made by those<br/>Who cried, `He is not Uther's son'--the King<br/>Sent to him, saying, `Arise, and help us thou!<br/>For here between the man and beast we die.'<br/><br/>And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,<br/>But heard the call, and came: and Guinevere<br/>Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;<br/>But since he neither wore on helm or shield<br/>The golden symbol of his kinglihood,<br/>But rode a simple knight among his knights,<br/>And many of these in richer arms than he,<br/>She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,<br/>One among many, though his face was bare.<br/>But Arthur, looking downward as he past,<br/>Felt the light of her eyes into his life<br/>Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched<br/>His tents beside the forest. Then he drave<br/>The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled<br/>The forest, letting in the sun, and made<br/>Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight<br/>And so returned.<br/><br/>For while he lingered there,<br/>A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts<br/>Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm<br/>Flashed forth and into war: for most of these,<br/>Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,<br/>Made head against him, crying, `Who is he<br/>That he should rule us? who hath proven him<br/>King Uther's son? for lo! we look at him,<br/>And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,<br/>Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.<br/>This is the son of Gorlos, not the King;<br/>This is the son of Anton, not the King.'<br/><br/>And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt<br/>Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,<br/>Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;<br/>And thinking as he rode, `Her father said<br/>That there between the man and beast they die.<br/>Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts<br/>Up to my throne, and side by side with me?<br/>What happiness to reign a lonely king,<br/>Vext--O ye stars that shudder over me,<br/>O earth that soundest hollow under me,<br/>Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined<br/>To her that is the fairest under heaven,<br/>I seem as nothing in the mighty world,<br/>And cannot will my will, nor work my work<br/>Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm<br/>Victor and lord. But were I joined with her,<br/>Then might we live together as one life,<br/>And reigning with one will in everything<br/>Have power on this dark land to lighten it,<br/>And power on this dead world to make it live.'<br/><br/>Thereafter--as he speaks who tells the tale--<br/>When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright<br/>With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world<br/>Was all so clear about him, that he saw<br/>The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,<br/>And even in high day the morning star.<br/>So when the King had set his banner broad,<br/>At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,<br/>And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,<br/>The long-lanced battle let their horses run.<br/>And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,<br/>And now the King, as here and there that war<br/>Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world<br/>Made lightnings and great thunders over him,<br/>And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,<br/>And mightier of his hands with every blow,<br/>And leading all his knighthood threw the kings<br/>Cardos, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,<br/>Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,<br/>The King Brandagoras of Latangor,<br/>With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,<br/>And Lot of Orkney. Then, before a voice<br/>As dreadful as the shout of one who sees<br/>To one who sins, and deems himself alone<br/>And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake<br/>Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands<br/>That hacked among the flyers, `Ho! they yield!'<br/>So like a painted battle the war stood<br/>Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,<br/>And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.<br/>He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved<br/>And honoured most. `Thou dost not doubt me King,<br/>So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.'<br/>`Sir and my liege,' he cried, `the fire of God<br/>Descends upon thee in the battle-field:<br/>I know thee for my King!' Whereat the two,<br/>For each had warded either in the fight,<br/>Sware on the field of death a deathless love.<br/>And Arthur said, `Man's word is God in man:<br/>Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.'<br/><br/>Then quickly from the foughten field he sent<br/>Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,<br/>His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,<br/>Saying, `If I in aught have served thee well,<br/>Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.'<br/><br/>Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart<br/>Debating--`How should I that am a king,<br/>However much he holp me at my need,<br/>Give my one daughter saving to a king,<br/>And a king's son?'--lifted his voice, and called<br/>A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom<br/>He trusted all things, and of him required<br/>His counsel: `Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?'<br/><br/>Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,<br/>`Sir King, there be but two old men that know:<br/>And each is twice as old as I; and one<br/>Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served<br/>King Uther through his magic art; and one<br/>Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,<br/>Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran<br/>Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,<br/>Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote<br/>All things and whatsoever Merlin did<br/>In one great annal-book, where after-years<br/>Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.'<br/><br/>To whom the King Leodogran replied,<br/>`O friend, had I been holpen half as well<br/>By this King Arthur as by thee today,<br/>Then beast and man had had their share of me:<br/>But summon here before us yet once more<br/>Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.'<br/><br/>Then, when they came before him, the King said,<br/>`I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,<br/>And reason in the chase: but wherefore now<br/>Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,<br/>Some calling Arthur born of Gorlos,<br/>Others of Anton? Tell me, ye yourselves,<br/>Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?'<br/><br/>And Ulfius and Brastias answered, `Ay.'<br/>Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights<br/>Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake--<br/>For bold in heart and act and word was he,<br/>Whenever slander breathed against the King--<br/><br/>`Sir, there be many rumours on this head:<br/>For there be those who hate him in their hearts,<br/>Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,<br/>And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:<br/>And there be those who deem him more than man,<br/>And dream he dropt from heaven: but my belief<br/>In all this matter--so ye care to learn--<br/>Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time<br/>The prince and warrior Gorlos, he that held<br/>Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,<br/>Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:<br/>And daughters had she borne him,--one whereof,<br/>Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,<br/>Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved<br/>To Arthur,--but a son she had not borne.<br/>And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:<br/>But she, a stainless wife to Gorlos,<br/>So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,<br/>That Gorlos and King Uther went to war:<br/>And overthrown was Gorlos and slain.<br/>Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged<br/>Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,<br/>Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,<br/>Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,<br/>And there was none to call to but himself.<br/>So, compassed by the power of the King,<br/>Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,<br/>And with a shameful swiftness: afterward,<br/>Not many moons, King Uther died himself,<br/>Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule<br/>After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.<br/>And that same night, the night of the new year,<br/>By reason of the bitterness and grief<br/>That vext his mother, all before his time<br/>Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born<br/>Delivered at a secret postern-gate<br/>To Merlin, to be holden far apart<br/>Until his hour should come; because the lords<br/>Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,<br/>Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child<br/>Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each<br/>But sought to rule for his own self and hand,<br/>And many hated Uther for the sake<br/>Of Gorlos. Wherefore Merlin took the child,<br/>And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight<br/>And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife<br/>Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;<br/>And no man knew. And ever since the lords<br/>Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,<br/>So that the realm has gone to wrack: but now,<br/>This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)<br/>Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,<br/>Proclaiming, "Here is Uther's heir, your king,"<br/>A hundred voices cried, "Away with him!<br/>No king of ours! a son of Gorlos he,<br/>Or else the child of Anton, and no king,<br/>Or else baseborn." Yet Merlin through his craft,<br/>And while the people clamoured for a king,<br/>Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords<br/>Banded, and so brake out in open war.'<br/><br/>Then while the King debated with himself<br/>If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,<br/>Or born the son of Gorlos, after death,<br/>Or Uther's son, and born before his time,<br/>Or whether there were truth in anything<br/>Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,<br/>With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,<br/>Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;<br/>Whom as he could, not as he would, the King<br/>Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat,<br/><br/>`A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.<br/>Ye come from Arthur's court. Victor his men<br/>Report him! Yea, but ye--think ye this king--<br/>So many those that hate him, and so strong,<br/>So few his knights, however brave they be--<br/>Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?'<br/><br/>`O King,' she cried, `and I will tell thee: few,<br/>Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;<br/>For I was near him when the savage yells<br/>Of Uther's peerage died, and Arthur sat<br/>Crowned on the das, and his warriors cried,<br/>"Be thou the king, and we will work thy will<br/>Who love thee." Then the King in low deep tones,<br/>And simple words of great authority,<br/>Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,<br/>That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some<br/>Were pale as at the passing of a ghost,<br/>Some flushed, and others dazed, as one who wakes<br/>Half-blinded at the coming of a light.<br/><br/>`But when he spake and cheered his Table Round<br/>With large, divine, and comfortable words,<br/>Beyond my tongue to tell thee--I beheld<br/>From eye to eye through all their Order flash<br/>A momentary likeness of the King:<br/>And ere it left their faces, through the cross<br/>And those around it and the Crucified,<br/>Down from the casement over Arthur, smote<br/>Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays,<br/>One falling upon each of three fair queens,<br/>Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends<br/>Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright<br/>Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.<br/><br/>`And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit<br/>And hundred winters are but as the hands<br/>Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.<br/><br/>`And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,<br/>Who knows a subtler magic than his own--<br/>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.<br/>She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,<br/>Whereby to drive the heathen out: a mist<br/>Of incense curled about her, and her face<br/>Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;<br/>But there was heard among the holy hymns<br/>A voice as of the waters, for she dwells<br/>Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms<br/>May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,<br/>Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.<br/><br/>`There likewise I beheld Excalibur<br/>Before him at his crowning borne, the sword<br/>That rose from out the bosom of the lake,<br/>And Arthur rowed across and took it--rich<br/>With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,<br/>Bewildering heart and eye--the blade so bright<br/>That men are blinded by it--on one side,<br/>Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,<br/>"Take me," but turn the blade and ye shall see,<br/>And written in the speech ye speak yourself,<br/>"Cast me away!" And sad was Arthur's face<br/>Taking it, but old Merlin counselled him,<br/>"Take thou and strike! the time to cast away<br/>Is yet far-off." So this great brand the king<br/>Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.'<br/><br/>Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought<br/>To sift his doubtings to the last, and asked,<br/>Fixing full eyes of question on her face,<br/>`The swallow and the swift are near akin,<br/>But thou art closer to this noble prince,<br/>Being his own dear sister;' and she said,<br/>`Daughter of Gorlos and Ygerne am I;'<br/>`And therefore Arthur's sister?' asked the King.<br/>She answered, `These be secret things,' and signed<br/>To those two sons to pass, and let them be.<br/>And Gawain went, and breaking into song<br/>Sprang out, and followed by his flying hair<br/>Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:<br/>But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,<br/>And there half-heard; the same that afterward<br/>Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.<br/><br/>And then the Queen made answer, `What know I?<br/>For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,<br/>And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark<br/>Was Gorlos, yea and dark was Uther too,<br/>Wellnigh to blackness; but this King is fair<br/>Beyond the race of Britons and of men.<br/>Moreover, always in my mind I hear<br/>A cry from out the dawning of my life,<br/>A mother weeping, and I hear her say,<br/>"O that ye had some brother, pretty one,<br/>To guard thee on the rough ways of the world."'<br/><br/>`Ay,' said the King, `and hear ye such a cry?<br/>But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?'<br/><br/>`O King!' she cried, `and I will tell thee true:<br/>He found me first when yet a little maid:<br/>Beaten I had been for a little fault<br/>Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran<br/>And flung myself down on a bank of heath,<br/>And hated this fair world and all therein,<br/>And wept, and wished that I were dead; and he--<br/>I know not whether of himself he came,<br/>Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk<br/>Unseen at pleasure--he was at my side,<br/>And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,<br/>And dried my tears, being a child with me.<br/>And many a time he came, and evermore<br/>As I grew greater grew with me; and sad<br/>At times he seemed, and sad with him was I,<br/>Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,<br/>But sweet again, and then I loved him well.<br/>And now of late I see him less and less,<br/>But those first days had golden hours for me,<br/>For then I surely thought he would be king.<br/><br/>`But let me tell thee now another tale:<br/>For Bleys, our Merlin's master, as they say,<br/>Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,<br/>To hear him speak before he left his life.<br/>Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;<br/>And when I entered told me that himself<br/>And Merlin ever served about the King,<br/>Uther, before he died; and on the night<br/>When Uther in Tintagil past away<br/>Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two<br/>Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,<br/>Then from the castle gateway by the chasm<br/>Descending through the dismal night--a night<br/>In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost--<br/>Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps<br/>It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof<br/>A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern<br/>Bright with a shining people on the decks,<br/>And gone as soon as seen. And then the two<br/>Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,<br/>Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,<br/>Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep<br/>And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged<br/>Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:<br/>And down the wave and in the flame was borne<br/>A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,<br/>Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried "The King!<br/>Here is an heir for Uther!" And the fringe<br/>Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,<br/>Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,<br/>And all at once all round him rose in fire,<br/>So that the child and he were clothed in fire.<br/>And presently thereafter followed calm,<br/>Free sky and stars: "And this the same child," he said,<br/>"Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace<br/>Till this were told." And saying this the seer<br/>Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,<br/>Not ever to be questioned any more<br/>Save on the further side; but when I met<br/>Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth--<br/>The shining dragon and the naked child<br/>Descending in the glory of the seas--<br/>He laughed as is his wont, and answered me<br/>In riddling triplets of old time, and said:<br/><br/>`"Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!<br/>A young man will be wiser by and by;<br/>An old man's wit may wander ere he die.<br/>Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!<br/>And truth is this to me, and that to thee;<br/>And truth or clothed or naked let it be.<br/>Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows:<br/>Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?<br/>From the great deep to the great deep he goes."<br/><br/>`So Merlin riddling angered me; but thou<br/>Fear not to give this King thy only child,<br/>Guinevere: so great bards of him will sing<br/>Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old<br/>Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,<br/>And echoed by old folk beside their fires<br/>For comfort after their wage-work is done,<br/>Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time<br/>Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn<br/>Though men may wound him that he will not die,<br/>But pass, again to come; and then or now<br/>Utterly smite the heathen underfoot,<br/>Till these and all men hail him for their king.'<br/><br/>She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,<br/>But musing, `Shall I answer yea or nay?'<br/>Doubted, and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,<br/>Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,<br/>Field after field, up to a height, the peak<br/>Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,<br/>Now looming, and now lost; and on the slope<br/>The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,<br/>Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,<br/>In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,<br/>Streamed to the peak, and mingled with the haze<br/>And made it thicker; while the phantom king<br/>Sent out at times a voice; and here or there<br/>Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest<br/>Slew on and burnt, crying, `No king of ours,<br/>No son of Uther, and no king of ours;'<br/>Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze<br/>Descended, and the solid earth became<br/>As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,<br/>Crowned. And Leodogran awoke, and sent<br/>Ulfius, and Brastias and Bedivere,<br/>Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.<br/><br/>Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved<br/>And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth<br/>And bring the Queen;--and watched him from the gates:<br/>And Lancelot past away among the flowers,<br/>(For then was latter April) and returned<br/>Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.<br/>To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,<br/>Chief of the church in Britain, and before<br/>The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King<br/>That morn was married, while in stainless white,<br/>The fair beginners of a nobler time,<br/>And glorying in their vows and him, his knights<br/>Stood around him, and rejoicing in his joy.<br/>Far shone the fields of May through open door,<br/>The sacred altar blossomed white with May,<br/>The Sun of May descended on their King,<br/>They gazed on all earth's beauty in their Queen,<br/>Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns<br/>A voice as of the waters, while the two<br/>Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:<br/>And Arthur said, `Behold, thy doom is mine.<br/>Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!'<br/>To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,<br/>`King and my lord, I love thee to the death!'<br/>And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,<br/>`Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world<br/>Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,<br/>And all this Order of thy Table Round<br/>Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!'<br/><br/>So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine<br/>Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood,<br/>In scornful stillness gazing as they past;<br/>Then while they paced a city all on fire<br/>With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,<br/>And Arthur's knighthood sang before the King:--<br/><br/>`Blow, trumpet, for the world is white with May;<br/>Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!<br/>Blow through the living world--"Let the King reign."<br/><br/>`Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur's realm?<br/>Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm,<br/>Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.<br/><br/>`Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard<br/>That God hath told the King a secret word.<br/>Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.<br/><br/>`Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.<br/>Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!<br/>Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.<br/><br/>`Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,<br/>The King is King, and ever wills the highest.<br/>Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.<br/><br/>`Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!<br/>Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!<br/>Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.<br/><br/>`The King will follow Christ, and we the King<br/>In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.<br/>Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.'<br/><br/>So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.<br/>There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,<br/>The slowly-fading mistress of the world,<br/>Strode in, and claimed their tribute as of yore.<br/>But Arthur spake, `Behold, for these have sworn<br/>To wage my wars, and worship me their King;<br/>The old order changeth, yielding place to new;<br/>And we that fight for our fair father Christ,<br/>Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old<br/>To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,<br/>No tribute will we pay:' so those great lords<br/>Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.<br/><br/>And Arthur and his knighthood for a space<br/>Were all one will, and through that strength the King<br/>Drew in the petty princedoms under him,<br/>Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame<br/>The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned.
