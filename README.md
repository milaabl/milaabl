# üíÆ Scenes From the Faust of Goethe by *Percy Bysshe Shelley*

<p>
    SCENE 1.--PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN.<br/><br/>THE LORD AND THE HOST OF HEAVEN.<br/><br/>ENTER THREE ARCHANGELS.<br/><br/>RAPHAEL:<br/>The sun makes music as of old<br/>Amid the rival spheres of Heaven,<br/>On its predestined circle rolled<br/>With thunder speed: the Angels even<br/>Draw strength from gazing on its glance,<br/>Though none its meaning fathom may:--<br/>The world's unwithered countenance<br/>Is bright as at Creation's day.<br/><br/>GABRIEL:<br/>And swift and swift, with rapid lightness,<br/>The adorned Earth spins silently,<br/>Alternating Elysian brightness<br/>With deep and dreadful night; the sea<br/>Foams in broad billows from the deep<br/>Up to the rocks, and rocks and Ocean,<br/>Onward, with spheres which never sleep,<br/>Are hurried in eternal motion.<br/><br/>MICHAEL:<br/>And tempests in contention roar<br/>From land to sea, from sea to land;<br/>And, raging, weave a chain of power,<br/>Which girds the earth, as with a band.--<br/>A flashing desolation there,<br/>Flames before the thunder's way;<br/>But Thy servants, Lord, revere<br/>The gentle changes of Thy day.<br/><br/>CHORUS OF THE THREE:<br/>The Angels draw strength from Thy glance,<br/>Though no one comprehend Thee may;--<br/>Thy world's unwithered countenance<br/>Is bright as on Creation's day.<br/><br/>GABRIEL:<br/>And swift, and inconceivably swift<br/>The adornment of earth winds itself round,<br/>And exchanges Paradise-clearness<br/>With deep dreadful night.<br/>The sea foams in broad waves<br/>From its deep bottom, up to the rocks,<br/>And rocks and sea are torn on together<br/>In the eternal swift course of the spheres.<br/><br/>MICHAEL:<br/>And storms roar in emulation<br/>From sea to land, from land to sea,<br/>And make, raging, a chain<br/>Of deepest operation round about.<br/>There flames a flashing destruction<br/>Before the path of the thunderbolt.<br/>But Thy servants, Lord, revere<br/>The gentle alternations of Thy day.<br/><br/>CHORUS:<br/>Thy countenance gives the Angels strength,<br/>Though none can comprehend Thee:<br/>And all Thy lofty works<br/>Are excellent as at the first day.<br/><br/>[ENTER MEPHISTOPHELES.]<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>As thou, O Lord, once more art kind enough<br/>To interest Thyself in our affairs,<br/>And ask, 'How goes it with you there below?'<br/>And as indulgently at other times<br/>Thou tookest not my visits in ill part,<br/>Thou seest me here once more among Thy household.<br/>Though I should scandalize this company,<br/>You will excuse me if I do not talk<br/>In the high style which they think fashionable;<br/>My pathos certainly would make You laugh too,<br/>Had You not long since given over laughing.<br/>Nothing know I to say of suns and worlds;<br/>I observe only how men plague themselves;--<br/>The little god o' the world keeps the same stamp,<br/>As wonderful as on creation's day:--<br/>A little better would he live, hadst Thou<br/>Not given him a glimpse of Heaven's light<br/>Which he calls reason, and employs it only<br/>To live more beastlily than any beast.<br/>With reverence to Your Lordship be it spoken,<br/>He's like one of those long-legged grasshoppers,<br/>Who flits and jumps about, and sings for ever<br/>The same old song i' the grass. There let him lie,<br/>Burying his nose in every heap of dung.<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>Have you no more to say? Do you come here<br/>Always to scold, and cavil, and complain?<br/>Seems nothing ever right to you on earth?<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>No, Lord! I find all there, as ever, bad at best.<br/>Even I am sorry for man's days of sorrow;<br/>I could myself almost give up the pleasure<br/>Of plaguing the poor things.<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>Knowest thou Faust?<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>The Doctor?<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>Ay; My servant Faust.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>In truth<br/>He serves You in a fashion quite his own;<br/>And the fool's meat and drink are not of earth.<br/>His aspirations bear him on so far<br/>That he is half aware of his own folly,<br/>For he demands from Heaven its fairest star,<br/>And from the earth the highest joy it bears,<br/>Yet all things far, and all things near, are vain<br/>To calm the deep emotions of his breast.<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>Though he now serves Me in a cloud of error,<br/>I will soon lead him forth to the clear day.<br/>When trees look green, full well the gardener knows<br/>That fruits and blooms will deck the coming year.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>What will You bet?--now am sure of winning--<br/>Only, observe You give me full permission<br/>To lead him softly on my path.<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>As long<br/>As he shall live upon the earth, so long<br/>Is nothing unto thee forbidden--Man<br/>Must err till he has ceased to struggle.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Thanks.<br/>And that is all I ask; for willingly<br/>I never make acquaintance with the dead.<br/>The full fresh cheeks of youth are food for me,<br/>And if a corpse knocks, I am not at home.<br/>For I am like a cat--I like to play<br/>A little with the mouse before I eat it.<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>Well, well! it is permitted thee. Draw thou<br/>His spirit from its springs; as thou find'st power<br/>Seize him and lead him on thy downward path;<br/>And stand ashamed when failure teaches thee<br/>That a good man, even in his darkest longings,<br/>Is well aware of the right way.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Well and good.<br/>I am not in much doubt about my bet,<br/>And if I lose, then 'tis Your turn to crow;<br/>Enjoy Your triumph then with a full breast.<br/>Ay; dust shall he devour, and that with pleasure,<br/>Like my old paramour, the famous Snake.<br/><br/>THE LORD:<br/>Pray come here when it suits you; for I never<br/>Had much dislike for people of your sort.<br/>And, among all the Spirits who rebelled,<br/>The knave was ever the least tedious to Me.<br/>The active spirit of man soon sleeps, and soon<br/>He seeks unbroken quiet; therefore I<br/>Have given him the Devil for a companion,<br/>Who may provoke him to some sort of work,<br/>And must create forever.--But ye, pure<br/>Children of God, enjoy eternal beauty;--<br/>Let that which ever operates and lives<br/>Clasp you within the limits of its love;<br/>And seize with sweet and melancholy thoughts<br/>The floating phantoms of its loveliness.<br/><br/>[HEAVEN CLOSES; THE ARCHANGELS EXEUNT.]<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>From time to time I visit the old fellow,<br/>And I take care to keep on good terms with Him.<br/>Civil enough is the same God Almighty,<br/>To talk so freely with the Devil himself.<br/><br/>SCENE 2.--MAY-DAY NIGHT.<br/><br/>THE HARTZ MOUNTAIN, A DESOLATE COUNTRY.<br/><br/>FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Would you not like a broomstick? As for me<br/>I wish I had a good stout ram to ride;<br/>For we are still far from the appointed place.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>This knotted staff is help enough for me,<br/>Whilst I feel fresh upon my legs. What good<br/>Is there in making short a pleasant way?<br/>To creep along the labyrinths of the vales,<br/>And climb those rocks, where ever-babbling springs,<br/>Precipitate themselves in waterfalls,<br/>Is the true sport that seasons such a path.<br/>Already Spring kindles the birchen spray,<br/>And the hoar pines already feel her breath:<br/>Shall she not work also within our limbs?<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Nothing of such an influence do I feel.<br/>My body is all wintry, and I wish<br/>The flowers upon our path were frost and snow.<br/>But see how melancholy rises now,<br/>Dimly uplifting her belated beam,<br/>The blank unwelcome round of the red moon,<br/>And gives so bad a light, that every step<br/>One stumbles 'gainst some crag. With your permission,<br/>I'll call on Ignis-fatuus to our aid:<br/>I see one yonder burning jollily.<br/>Halloo, my friend! may I request that you<br/>Would favour us with your bright company?<br/>Why should you blaze away there to no purpose?<br/>Pray be so good as light us up this way.<br/><br/>IGNIS-FATUUS:<br/>With reverence be it spoken, I will try<br/>To overcome the lightness of my nature;<br/>Our course, you know, is generally zigzag.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Ha, ha! your worship thinks you have to deal<br/>With men. Go straight on, in the Devil's name,<br/>Or I shall puff your flickering life out.<br/><br/>IGNIS-FATUUS:<br/>Well,<br/>I see you are the master of the house;<br/>I will accommodate myself to you.<br/>Only consider that to-night this mountain<br/>Is all enchanted, and if Jack-a-lantern<br/>Shows you his way, though you should miss your own,<br/>You ought not to be too exact with him.<br/><br/>FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, AND IGNIS-FATUUS, IN ALTERNATE CHORUS:<br/>The limits of the sphere of dream,<br/>The bounds of true and false, are past.<br/>Lead us on, thou wandering Gleam,<br/>Lead us onward, far and fast,<br/>To the wide, the desert waste.<br/><br/>But see, how swift advance and shift<br/>Trees behind trees, row by row,--<br/>How, clift by clift, rocks bend and lift<br/>Their frowning foreheads as we go.<br/>The giant-snouted crags, ho! ho!<br/>How they snort, and how they blow!<br/><br/>Through the mossy sods and stones,<br/>Stream and streamlet hurry down--<br/>A rushing throng! A sound of song<br/>Beneath the vault of Heaven is blown!<br/>Sweet notes of love, the speaking tones<br/>Of this bright day, sent down to say<br/>That Paradise on Earth is known,<br/>Resound around, beneath, above.<br/>All we hope and all we love<br/>Finds a voice in this blithe strain,<br/>Which wakens hill and wood and rill,<br/>And vibrates far o'er field and vale,<br/>And which Echo, like the tale<br/>Of old times, repeats again.<br/><br/>To-whoo! to-whoo! near, nearer now<br/>The sound of song, the rushing throng!<br/>Are the screech, the lapwing, and the jay,<br/>All awake as if 'twere day?<br/>See, with long legs and belly wide,<br/>A salamander in the brake!<br/>Every root is like a snake,<br/>And along the loose hillside,<br/>With strange contortions through the night,<br/>Curls, to seize or to affright;<br/>And, animated, strong, and many,<br/>They dart forth polypus-antennae,<br/>To blister with their poison spume<br/>The wanderer. Through the dazzling gloom<br/>The many-coloured mice, that thread<br/>The dewy turf beneath our tread,<br/>In troops each other's motions cross,<br/>Through the heath and through the moss;<br/>And, in legions intertangled,<br/>The fire-flies flit, and swarm, and throng,<br/>Till all the mountain depths are spangled.<br/><br/>Tell me, shall we go or stay?<br/>Shall we onward? Come along!<br/>Everything around is swept<br/>Forward, onward, far away!<br/>Trees and masses intercept<br/>The sight, and wisps on every side<br/>Are puffed up and multiplied.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Now vigorously seize my skirt, and gain<br/>This pinnacle of isolated crag.<br/>One may observe with wonder from this point,<br/>How Mammon glows among the mountains.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Ay--<br/>And strangely through the solid depth below<br/>A melancholy light, like the red dawn,<br/>Shoots from the lowest gorge of the abyss<br/>Of mountains, lightning hitherward: there rise<br/>Pillars of smoke, here clouds float gently by;<br/>Here the light burns soft as the enkindled air,<br/>Or the illumined dust of golden flowers;<br/>And now it glides like tender colours spreading;<br/>And now bursts forth in fountains from the earth;<br/>And now it winds, one torrent of broad light,<br/>Through the far valley with a hundred veins;<br/>And now once more within that narrow corner<br/>Masses itself into intensest splendour.<br/>And near us, see, sparks spring out of the ground,<br/>Like golden sand scattered upon the darkness;<br/>The pinnacles of that black wall of mountains<br/>That hems us in are kindled.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Rare: in faith!<br/>Does not Sir Mammon gloriously illuminate<br/>His palace for this festival?--it is<br/>A pleasure which you had not known before.<br/>I spy the boisterous guests already.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>How<br/>The children of the wind rage in the air!<br/>With what fierce strokes they fall upon my neck!<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Cling tightly to the old ribs of the crag.<br/>Beware! for if with them thou warrest<br/>In their fierce flight towards the wilderness,<br/>Their breath will sweep thee into dust, and drag<br/>Thy body to a grave in the abyss.<br/>A cloud thickens the night.<br/>Hark! how the tempest crashes through the forest!<br/>The owls fly out in strange affright;<br/>The columns of the evergreen palaces<br/>Are split and shattered;<br/>The roots creak, and stretch, and groan;<br/>And ruinously overthrown,<br/>The trunks are crushed and shattered<br/>By the fierce blast's unconquerable stress.<br/>Over each other crack and crash they all<br/>In terrible and intertangled fall;<br/>And through the ruins of the shaken mountain<br/>The airs hiss and howl--<br/>It is not the voice of the fountain,<br/>Nor the wolf in his midnight prowl.<br/>Dost thou not hear?<br/>Strange accents are ringing<br/>Aloft, afar, anear?<br/>The witches are singing!<br/>The torrent of a raging wizard song<br/>Streams the whole mountain along.<br/><br/>CHORUS OF WITCHES:<br/>The stubble is yellow, the corn is green,<br/>Now to the Brocken the witches go;<br/>The mighty multitude here may be seen<br/>Gathering, wizard and witch, below.<br/>Sir Urian is sitting aloft in the air;<br/>Hey over stock! and hey over stone!<br/>'Twixt witches and incubi, what shall be done?<br/>Tell it who dare! tell it who dare!<br/><br/>A VOICE:<br/>Upon a sow-swine, whose farrows were nine,<br/>Old Baubo rideth alone.<br/><br/>CHORUS:<br/>Honour her, to whom honour is due,<br/>Old mother Baubo, honour to you!<br/>An able sow, with old Baubo upon her,<br/>Is worthy of glory, and worthy of honour!<br/>The legion of witches is coming behind,<br/>Darkening the night, and outspeeding the wind--<br/><br/>A VOICE:<br/>Which way comest thou?<br/><br/>A VOICE:<br/>Over Ilsenstein;<br/>The owl was awake in the white moonshine;<br/>I saw her at rest in her downy nest,<br/>And she stared at me with her broad, bright eyne.<br/><br/>VOICES:<br/>And you may now as well take your course on to Hell,<br/>Since you ride by so fast on the headlong blast.<br/><br/>A VOICE:<br/>She dropped poison upon me as I passed.<br/>Here are the wounds--<br/><br/>CHORUS OF WITCHES:<br/>Come away! come along!<br/>The way is wide, the way is long,<br/>But what is that for a Bedlam throng?<br/>Stick with the prong, and scratch with the broom.<br/>The child in the cradle lies strangled at home,<br/>And the mother is clapping her hands.--<br/><br/>SEMICHORUS OF WIZARDS 1:<br/>We glide in<br/>Like snails when the women are all away;<br/>And from a house once given over to sin<br/>Woman has a thousand steps to stray.<br/><br/>SEMICHORUS 2:<br/>A thousand steps must a woman take,<br/>Where a man but a single spring will make.<br/><br/>VOICES ABOVE:<br/>Come with us, come with us, from Felsensee.<br/><br/>VOICES BELOW:<br/>With what joy would we fly through the upper sky!<br/>We are washed, we are 'nointed, stark naked are we;<br/>But our toil and our pain are forever in vain.<br/><br/>BOTH CHORUSES:<br/>The wind is still, the stars are fled,<br/>The melancholy moon is dead;<br/>The magic notes, like spark on spark,<br/>Drizzle, whistling through the dark. Come away!<br/><br/>VOICES BELOW:<br/>Stay, Oh, stay!<br/><br/>VOICES ABOVE:<br/>Out of the crannies of the rocks<br/>Who calls?<br/><br/>VOICES BELOW:<br/>Oh, let me join your flocks!<br/>I, three hundred years have striven<br/>To catch your skirt and mount to Heaven,--<br/>And still in vain. Oh, might I be<br/>With company akin to me!<br/><br/>BOTH CHORUSES:<br/>Some on a ram and some on a prong,<br/>On poles and on broomsticks we flutter along;<br/>Forlorn is the wight who can rise not to-night.<br/><br/>A HALF-WITCH BELOW:<br/>I have been tripping this many an hour:<br/>Are the others already so far before?<br/>No quiet at home, and no peace abroad!<br/>And less methinks is found by the road.<br/><br/>CHORUS OF WITCHES:<br/>Come onward, away! aroint thee, aroint!<br/>A witch to be strong must anoint--anoint--<br/>Then every trough will be boat enough;<br/>With a rag for a sail we can sweep through the sky,<br/>Who flies not to-night, when means he to fly?<br/><br/>BOTH CHORUSES:<br/>We cling to the skirt, and we strike on the ground;<br/>Witch-legions thicken around and around;<br/>Wizard-swarms cover the heath all over.<br/><br/>[THEY DESCEND.]<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>What thronging, dashing, raging, rustling;<br/>What whispering, babbling, hissing, bustling;<br/>What glimmering, spurting, stinking, burning,<br/>As Heaven and Earth were overturning.<br/>There is a true witch element about us;<br/>Take hold on me, or we shall be divided:--<br/>Where are you?<br/><br/>FAUST [FROM A DISTANCE]:<br/>Here!<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>What!<br/>I must exert my authority in the house.<br/>Place for young Voland! pray make way, good people.<br/>Take hold on me, doctor, an with one step<br/>Let us escape from this unpleasant crowd:<br/>They are too mad for people of my sort.<br/>Just there shines a peculiar kind of light--<br/>Something attracts me in those bushes. Come<br/>This way: we shall slip down there in a minute.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Spirit of Contradiction! Well, lead on--<br/>'Twere a wise feat indeed to wander out<br/>Into the Brocken upon May-day night,<br/>And then to isolate oneself in scorn,<br/>Disgusted with the humours of the time.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>See yonder, round a many-coloured flame<br/>A merry club is huddled altogether:<br/>Even with such little people as sit there<br/>One would not be alone.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Would that I were<br/>Up yonder in the glow and whirling smoke,<br/>Where the blind million rush impetuously<br/>To meet the evil ones; there might I solve<br/>Many a riddle that torments me.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Yet<br/>Many a riddle there is tied anew<br/>Inextricably. Let the great world rage!<br/>We will stay here safe in the quiet dwellings.<br/>'Tis an old custom. Men have ever built<br/>Their own small world in the great world of all.<br/>I see young witches naked there, and old ones<br/>Wisely attired with greater decency.<br/>Be guided now by me, and you shall buy<br/>A pound of pleasure with a dram of trouble.<br/>I hear them tune their instruments--one must<br/>Get used to this damned scraping. Come, I'll lead you<br/>Among them; and what there you do and see,<br/>As a fresh compact 'twixt us two shall be.<br/>How say you now? this space is wide enough--<br/>Look forth, you cannot see the end of it--<br/>An hundred bonfires burn in rows, and they<br/>Who throng around them seem innumerable:<br/>Dancing and drinking, jabbering, making love,<br/>And cooking, are at work. Now tell me, friend,<br/>What is there better in the world than this?<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>In introducing us, do you assume<br/>The character of Wizard or of Devil?<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>In truth, I generally go about<br/>In strict incognito; and yet one likes<br/>To wear one's orders upon gala days.<br/>I have no ribbon at my knee; but here<br/>At home, the cloven foot is honourable.<br/>See you that snail there?--she comes creeping up,<br/>And with her feeling eyes hath smelt out something.<br/>I could not, if I would, mask myself here.<br/>Come now, we'll go about from fire to fire:<br/>I'll be the Pimp, and you shall be the Lover.<br/>[TO SOME OLD WOMEN, WHO ARE SITTING ROUND A HEAP OF GLIMMERING COALS.]<br/>Old gentlewomen, what do you do out here?<br/>You ought to be with the young rioters<br/>Right in the thickest of the revelry--<br/>But every one is best content at home.<br/><br/>General.<br/>Who dare confide in right or a just claim?<br/>So much as I had done for them! and now--<br/>With women and the people 'tis the same,<br/>Youth will stand foremost ever,--age may go<br/>To the dark grave unhonoured.<br/><br/>MINISTER:<br/>Nowadays<br/>People assert their rights: they go too far;<br/>But as for me, the good old times I praise;<br/>Then we were all in all--'twas something worth<br/>One's while to be in place and wear a star;<br/>That was indeed the golden age on earth.<br/><br/>PARVENU:<br/>We too are active, and we did and do<br/>What we ought not, perhaps; and yet we now<br/>Will seize, whilst all things are whirled round and round,<br/>A spoke of Fortune's wheel, and keep our ground.<br/><br/>AUTHOR:<br/>Who now can taste a treatise of deep sense<br/>And ponderous volume? 'tis impertinence<br/>To write what none will read, therefore will I<br/>To please the young and thoughtless people try.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES [WHO AT ONCE APPEARS TO HAVE GROWN VERY OLD]:<br/>I<br/>find the people ripe for the last day,<br/>Since I last came up to the wizard mountain;<br/>And as my little cask runs turbid now,<br/>So is the world drained to the dregs.<br/><br/>PEDLAR-WITCH:<br/>Look here,<br/>Gentlemen; do not hurry on so fast;<br/>And lose the chance of a good pennyworth.<br/>I have a pack full of the choicest wares<br/>Of every sort, and yet in all my bundle<br/>Is nothing like what may be found on earth;<br/>Nothing that in a moment will make rich<br/>Men and the world with fine malicious mischief--<br/>There is no dagger drunk with blood; no bowl<br/>From which consuming poison may be drained<br/>By innocent and healthy lips; no jewel,<br/>The price of an abandoned maiden's shame;<br/>No sword which cuts the bond it cannot loose,<br/>Or stabs the wearer's enemy in the back;<br/>No--<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Gossip, you know little of these times.<br/>What has been, has been; what is done, is past,<br/>They shape themselves into the innovations<br/>They breed, and innovation drags us with it.<br/>The torrent of the crowd sweeps over us:<br/>You think to impel, and are yourself impelled.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>What is that yonder?<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Mark her well. It is<br/>Lilith.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Who?<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Lilith, the first wife of Adam.<br/>Beware of her fair hair, for she excels<br/>All women in the magic of her locks;<br/>And when she winds them round a young man's neck,<br/>She will not ever set him free again.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>There sit a girl and an old woman--they<br/>Seem to be tired with pleasure and with play.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>There is no rest to-night for any one:<br/>When one dance ends another is begun;<br/>Come, let us to it. We shall have rare fun.<br/><br/>[FAUST DANCES AND SINGS WITH A GIRL, AND<br/>MEPHISTOPHELES WITH AN OLD WOMAN.]<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>I had once a lovely dream<br/>In which I saw an apple-tree,<br/>Where two fair apples with their gleam<br/>To climb and taste attracted me.<br/><br/>THE GIRL:<br/>She with apples you desired<br/>From Paradise came long ago:<br/>With you I feel that if required,<br/>Such still within my garden grow.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>PROCTO-PHANTASMIST:<br/>What is this cursed multitude about?<br/>Have we not long since proved to demonstration<br/>That ghosts move not on ordinary feet?<br/>But these are dancing just like men and women.<br/><br/>THE GIRL:<br/>What does he want then at our ball?<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Oh! he<br/>Is far above us all in his conceit:<br/>Whilst we enjoy, he reasons of enjoyment;<br/>And any step which in our dance we tread,<br/>If it be left out of his reckoning,<br/>Is not to be considered as a step.<br/>There are few things that scandalize him not:<br/>And when you whirl round in the circle now,<br/>As he went round the wheel in his old mill,<br/>He says that you go wrong in all respects,<br/>Especially if you congratulate him<br/>Upon the strength of the resemblance.<br/><br/>PROCTO-PHANTASMIST:<br/>Fly!<br/>Vanish! Unheard-of impudence! What, still there!<br/>In this enlightened age too, since you have been<br/>Proved not to exist!--But this infernal brood<br/>Will hear no reason and endure no rule.<br/>Are we so wise, and is the POND still haunted?<br/>How long have I been sweeping out this rubbish<br/>Of superstition, and the world will not<br/>Come clean with all my pains!--it is a case<br/>Unheard of!<br/><br/>THE GIRL:<br/>Then leave off teasing us so.<br/><br/>PROCTO-PHANTASMIST:<br/>I tell you, spirits, to your faces now,<br/>That I should not regret this despotism<br/>Of spirits, but that mine can wield it not.<br/>To-night I shall make poor work of it,<br/>Yet I will take a round with you, and hope<br/>Before my last step in the living dance<br/>To beat the poet and the devil together.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>At last he will sit down in some foul puddle;<br/>That is his way of solacing himself;<br/>Until some leech, diverted with his gravity,<br/>Cures him of spirits and the spirit together.<br/>[TO FAUST, WHO HAS SECEDED FROM THE DANCE.]<br/>Why do you let that fair girl pass from you,<br/>Who sung so sweetly to you in the dance?<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>A red mouse in the middle of her singing<br/>Sprung from her mouth.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>That was all right, my friend:<br/>Be it enough that the mouse was not gray.<br/>Do not disturb your hour of happiness<br/>With close consideration of such trifles.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Then saw I--<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>What?<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Seest thou not a pale,<br/>Fair girl, standing alone, far, far away?<br/>She drags herself now forward with slow steps,<br/>And seems as if she moved with shackled feet:<br/>I cannot overcome the thought that she<br/>Is like poor Margaret.<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Let it be--pass on--<br/>No good can come of it--it is not well<br/>To meet it--it is an enchanted phantom,<br/>A lifeless idol; with its numbing look,<br/>It freezes up the blood of man; and they<br/>Who meet its ghastly stare are turned to stone,<br/>Like those who saw Medusa.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Oh, too true!<br/>Her eyes are like the eyes of a fresh corpse<br/>Which no beloved hand has closed, alas!<br/>That is the breast which Margaret yielded to me--<br/>Those are the lovely limbs which I enjoyed!<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>It is all magic, poor deluded fool!<br/>She looks to every one like his first love.<br/><br/>FAUST:<br/>Oh, what delight! what woe! I cannot turn<br/>My looks from her sweet piteous countenance.<br/>How strangely does a single blood-red line,<br/>Not broader than the sharp edge of a knife,<br/>Adorn her lovely neck!<br/><br/>MEPHISTOPHELES:<br/>Ay, she can carry<br/>Her head under her arm upon occasion;<br/>Perseus has cut it off for her. These pleasures<br/>End in delusion.--Gain this rising ground,<br/>It is as airy here as in a...<br/>And if I am not mightily deceived,<br/>I see a theatre.--What may this mean?<br/><br/>ATTENDANT:<br/>Quite a new piece, the last of seven, for 'tis<br/>The custom now to represent that number.<br/>'Tis written by a Dilettante, and<br/>The actors who perform are Dilettanti;<br/>Excuse me, gentlemen; but I must vanish.<br/>I am a Dilettante curtain-lifter.<br/><br/>JUVENILIA.
