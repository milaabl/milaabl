# üíÆ The Rape of the Lock: by *Alexander Pope*

<p>
    AN HEROI-COMICAL POEM.<br/><br/>'Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos;<br/>  Sed juvat, hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis.'<br/><br/>MART.<br/><br/>TO MRS ARABELLA FERMOR.<br/><br/>CANTO I.<br/><br/>What dire offence from amorous causes springs,<br/>What mighty contests rise from trivial things,<br/>I sing--This verse to Caryll, Muse! is due:<br/>This, even Belinda may vouchsafe to view:<br/>Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,<br/>If she inspire, and he approve my lays.<br/><br/>Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel<br/>A well-bred lord t'assault a gentle belle?<br/>Oh, say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,<br/>Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?<br/>In tasks so bold, can little men engage,<br/>And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage?<br/><br/>Sol through white curtains shot a timorous ray,<br/>And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:<br/>Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,<br/>And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:<br/>Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,<br/>And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.<br/>Belinda still her downy pillow press'd,<br/>Her guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:<br/>'Twas he had summon'd to her silent bed<br/>The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head,<br/>A youth more glittering than a birth-night beau,<br/>(That even in slumber caused her cheek to glow),<br/>Seem'd to her ear his willing lips to lay,<br/>And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say:<br/><br/>'Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care<br/>Of thousand bright inhabitants of air!<br/>If e'er one vision touch thy infant thought,<br/>Of all the nurse and all the priest have taught;<br/>Of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen,<br/>The silver token, and the circled green,<br/>Or virgins visited by angel-powers,<br/>With golden crowns and wreaths of heavenly flowers;<br/>Hear and believe! thy own importance know,<br/>Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.<br/>Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,<br/>To maids alone and children are reveal'd:<br/>What though no credit doubting wits may give?<br/>The fair and innocent shall still believe.<br/>Know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly,<br/>The light militia of the lower sky:<br/>These, though unseen, are ever on the wing,<br/>Hang o'er the box, and hover round the ring.<br/>Think what an equipage thou hast in air,<br/>And view with scorn two pages and a chair.<br/>As now your own, our beings were of old,<br/>And once enclosed in woman's beauteous mould;<br/>Thence, by a soft transition, we repair<br/>From earthly vehicles to these of air.<br/>Think not, when woman's transient breath is fled,<br/>That all her vanities at once are dead;<br/>Succeeding vanities she still regards,<br/>And though she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.<br/>Her joy in gilded chariots, when alive,<br/>And love of ombre, after death survive.<br/>For when the fair in all their pride expire,<br/>To their first elements their souls retire:<br/>The sprites of fiery termagants in flame<br/>Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.<br/>Soft yielding minds to water glide away,<br/>And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental tea.<br/>The graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome,<br/>In search of mischief still on earth to roam.<br/>The light coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,<br/>And sport and flutter in the fields of air.<br/><br/>'Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste<br/>Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embraced:<br/>For spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease<br/>Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.<br/>What guards the purity of melting maids,<br/>In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,<br/>Safe from the treacherous friend, the daring spark,<br/>The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,<br/>When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,<br/>When music softens, and when dancing fires?<br/>'Tis but their Sylph, the wise celestials know,<br/>Though honour is the word with men below.<br/><br/>'Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,<br/>For life predestined to the Gnomes' embrace.<br/>These swell their prospects, and exalt their pride,<br/>When offers are disdain'd, and love denied;<br/>Then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain,<br/>While peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train,<br/>And garters, stars, and coronets appear,<br/>And in soft sounds, 'Your Grace' salutes their ear.<br/>'Tis these that early taint the female soul,<br/>Instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll,<br/>Teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know,<br/>And little hearts to flutter at a beau.<br/><br/>'Oft, when the world imagine women stray,<br/>The Sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way,<br/>Through all the giddy circle they pursue,<br/>And old impertinence expel by new.<br/>What tender maid but must a victim fall<br/>To one man's treat, but for another's ball?<br/>When Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,<br/>If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?<br/>With varying vanities, from every part,<br/>They shift the moving toyshop of their heart,<br/>Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,<br/>Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.<br/>This erring mortals levity may call,<br/>Oh, blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.<br/><br/>'Of these am I, who thy protection claim,<br/>A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.<br/>Late, as I ranged the crystal wilds of air,<br/>In the clear mirror of thy ruling star<br/>I saw, alas! some dread event impend,<br/>Ere to the main this morning sun descend,<br/>But heaven reveals not what, or how, or where:<br/>Warn'd by the Sylph, oh, pious maid, beware!<br/>This to disclose is all thy guardian can:<br/>Beware of all, but most beware of man!'<br/><br/>He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,<br/>Leap'd up, and waked his mistress with his tongue.<br/>'Twas then, Belinda, if report say true,<br/>Thy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux;<br/>Wounds, charms, and ardours, were no sooner read,<br/>But all the vision vanish'd from thy head.<br/><br/>And now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd,<br/>Each silver vase in mystic order laid.<br/>First, robed in white, the nymph intent adores,<br/>With head uncover'd, the cosmetic powers.<br/>A heavenly image in the glass appears,<br/>To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;<br/>The inferior priestess, at her altar's side,<br/>Trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride.<br/>Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here<br/>The various offerings of the world appear;<br/>From each she nicely culls with curious toil,<br/>And decks the goddess with the glittering spoil.<br/>This casket India's glowing gems unlocks,<br/>And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.<br/>The tortoise here, and elephant unite,<br/>Transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white.<br/>Here files of pins extend their shining rows,<br/>Puffs, powders, patches, Bibles, billet-doux.<br/>Now awful beauty puts on all its arms;<br/>The fair each moment rises in her charms,<br/>Repairs her smiles, awakens every grace,<br/>And calls forth all the wonders of her face;<br/>Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,<br/>And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.<br/>The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,<br/>These set the head, and those divide the hair,<br/>Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown:<br/>And Betty's praised for labours not her own.<br/><br/>CANTO II.<br/><br/>Not with more glories, in the ethereal plain,<br/>The sun first rises o'er the purpled main,<br/>Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams<br/>Launched on the bosom of the silver Thames.<br/>Fair nymphs and well-dress'd youths around her shone,<br/>But every eye was fix'd on her alone.<br/>On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,<br/>Which Jews might kiss, and infidels adore.<br/>Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,<br/>Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:<br/>Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;<br/>Oft she rejects, but never once offends.<br/>Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,<br/>And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.<br/>Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride<br/>Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:<br/>If to her share some female errors fall,<br/>Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.<br/><br/>This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,<br/>Nourish'd two locks, which graceful hung behind<br/>In equal curls, and well conspired to deck<br/>With shining ringlets the smooth ivory neck.<br/>Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,<br/>And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.<br/>With hairy springes we the birds betray,<br/>Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,<br/>Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,<br/>And beauty draws us with a single hair.<br/><br/>The adventurous Baron the bright locks admired;<br/>He saw, he wished, and to the prize aspired.<br/>Resolved to win, he meditates the way,<br/>By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;<br/>For when success a lover's toil attends,<br/>Few ask if fraud or force attain'd his ends.<br/><br/>For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implored<br/>Propitious Heaven, and every power adored,<br/>But chiefly Love--to Love an altar built,<br/>Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.<br/>There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;<br/>And all the trophies of his former loves;<br/>With tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,<br/>And breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire.<br/>Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes<br/>Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:<br/>The powers gave ear, and granted half his prayer,<br/>The rest, the winds dispersed in empty air.<br/><br/>But now secure the painted vessel glides,<br/>The sunbeams trembling on the floating tides:<br/>While melting music steals upon the sky,<br/>And soften'd sounds along the waters die;<br/>Smooth flow the waves, the zephyrs gently play,<br/>Belinda smiled, and all the world was gay.<br/>All but the Sylph--with careful thoughts oppress'd,<br/>The impending woe sat heavy on his breast.<br/>He summons straight his denizens of air;<br/>The lucid squadrons round the sails repair;<br/>Soft o'er the shrouds a√´rial whispers breathe,<br/>That seem'd but zephyrs to the train beneath.<br/>Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,<br/>Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;<br/>Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,<br/>Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light.<br/>Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,<br/>Thin glittering textures of the filmy dew,<br/>Dipp'd in the richest tincture of the skies,<br/>Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes;<br/>While every beam new transient colours flings,<br/>Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.<br/>Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,<br/>Superior by the head, was Ariel placed;<br/>His purple pinions opening to the sun,<br/>He raised his azure wand, and thus begun:<br/><br/>'Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear,<br/>Fays, fairies, genii, elves, and demons hear!<br/>Ye know the spheres, and various tasks assign'd<br/>By laws eternal to the a√´rial kind.<br/>Some in the fields of purest ether play,<br/>And bask and whiten in the blaze of day:<br/>Some guide the course of wandering orbs on high,<br/>Or roll the planets through the boundless sky:<br/>Some, less refined, beneath the moon's pale light<br/>Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,<br/>Or suck the mists in grosser air below,<br/>Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,<br/>Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,<br/>Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.<br/>Others on earth o'er human race preside,<br/>Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:<br/>Of these the chief the care of nations own,<br/>And guard with arms divine the British throne.<br/><br/>'Our humbler province is to tend the fair,<br/>Not a less pleasing, though less glorious care;<br/>To save the powder from too rude a gale,<br/>Nor let the imprison'd essences exhale;<br/>To draw fresh colours from the vernal flowers;<br/>To steal from rainbows, ere they drop in showers,<br/>A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,<br/>Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;<br/>Nay, oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,<br/>To change a flounce, or add a furbelow.<br/><br/>'This day, black omens threat the brightest fair<br/>That e'er deserved a watchful spirit's care;<br/>Some dire disaster, or by force, or flight;<br/>But what, or where, the Fates have wrapt in night.<br/>Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,<br/>Or some frail China jar receive a flaw;<br/>Or stain her honour, or her new brocade;<br/>Forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;<br/>Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;<br/>Or whether Heaven has doom'd that Shock must fall,<br/>Haste then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:<br/>The fluttering fan be Zephyretta's care;<br/>The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;<br/>And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;<br/>Do thou, Crispissa, tend her favourite lock;<br/>Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.<br/><br/>'To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,<br/>We trust the important charge, the petticoat:<br/>Oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail,<br/>Though stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;  120<br/>Form a strong line about the silver bound,<br/>And guard the wide circumference around.<br/><br/>'Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,<br/>His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,<br/>Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,<br/>Be stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;<br/>Or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie,<br/>Or wedged whole ages in a bodkin's eye:<br/>Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,<br/>While, clogg'd, he beats his silken wings in vain;<br/>Or alum styptics with contracting power<br/>Shrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flower:<br/>Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel<br/>The giddy motion of the whirling mill,<br/>In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,<br/>And tremble at the sea that froths below!'<br/><br/>He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;<br/>Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;<br/>Some thread the mazy ringlets of her hair;<br/>Some hang upon the pendants of her ear;<br/>With beating hearts the dire event they wait,<br/>Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.<br/><br/>CANTO III.<br/><br/>Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flowers,<br/>Where Thames with pride surveys his rising towers,<br/>There stands a structure of majestic frame,<br/>Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.<br/>Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom<br/>Of foreign tyrants, and of nymphs at home;<br/>Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,<br/>Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.<br/><br/>Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,<br/>To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;<br/>In various talk the instructive hours they pass'd,<br/>Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;<br/>One speaks the glory of the British Queen,<br/>And one describes a charming Indian screen;<br/>A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;<br/>At every word a reputation dies.<br/>Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,<br/>With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,<br/>The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;<br/>The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,<br/>And wretches hang that jurymen may dine;<br/>The merchant from the Exchange returns in peace,<br/>And the long labours of the toilet cease.<br/>Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,<br/>Burns to encounter two adventurous knights,<br/>At ombre singly to decide their doom,<br/>And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.<br/>Straight the three bands prepare in arras to join,<br/>Each band the number of the sacred Nine.<br/>Soon as she spreads her hand, the a√´rial guard<br/>Descend, and sit on each important card:<br/>First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,<br/>Then each, according to the rank they bore;<br/>For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,<br/>Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.<br/><br/>Behold, four Kings in majesty revered,<br/>With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;<br/>And four fair Queens, whose hands sustain a flower,<br/>Th' expressive emblem of their softer power;<br/>Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,<br/>Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;<br/>And particolour'd troops, a shining train,<br/>Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.<br/><br/>The skilful nymph reviews her force with care:<br/>'Let Spades be Trumps!' she said, and Trumps they were.<br/><br/>Now move to war her sable Matadores,<br/>In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.<br/>Spadillio first, unconquerable lord!<br/>Led off two captive Trumps, and swept the board.<br/>As many more Manillio forced to yield,<br/>And march'd a victor from the verdant field.<br/>Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard<br/>Gain'd but one Trump and one plebeian card.<br/>With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,<br/>The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,<br/>Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd,<br/>The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.<br/>The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,<br/>Proves the just victim of his royal rage.<br/>Even mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew<br/>And mow'd down armies in the fights of Loo,<br/>Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,<br/>Falls undistinguish'd by the victor Spade!<br/><br/>Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;<br/>Now to the Baron fate inclines the field.<br/>His warlike Amazon her host invades,<br/>The imperial consort of the crown of Spades.<br/>The Club's black tyrant first her victim died,<br/>Spite of his haughty mien, and barbarous pride:<br/>What boots the regal circle on his head,<br/>His giant limbs in state unwieldy spread;<br/>That long behind he trails his pompous robe,<br/>And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?<br/><br/>The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;<br/>The embroider'd King who shows but half his face,<br/>And his refulgent Queen, with powers combined,<br/>Of broken troops an easy conquest find.<br/>Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,<br/>With throngs promiscuous strew the level green.<br/>Thus when dispersed a routed army runs,<br/>Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,<br/>With like confusion different nations fly,<br/>Of various habit and of various dye;<br/>The pierced battalions disunited fall<br/>In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.<br/><br/>The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,<br/>And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.<br/>At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,<br/>A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;<br/>She sees, and trembles at the approaching ill,<br/>Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille.<br/>And now, (as oft in some distemper'd state)<br/>On one nice trick depends the general fate,<br/>An Ace of Hearts steps forth: the King unseen<br/>Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:<br/>He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,<br/>And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.<br/>The nymph, exulting, fills with shouts the sky;<br/>The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.<br/><br/>O thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,<br/>Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.<br/>Sudden these honours shall be snatch'd away,<br/>And cursed for ever this victorious day.<br/><br/>For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,<br/>The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;<br/>On shining altars of Japan they raise<br/>The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:<br/>From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,<br/>While China's earth receives the smoking tide:<br/>At once they gratify their scent and taste,<br/>And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.<br/>Straight hover round the fair her airy band;<br/>Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,<br/>Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,<br/>Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.<br/>Coffee (which makes the politician wise,<br/>And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)<br/>Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain<br/>New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.<br/>Ah, cease, rash youth! desist ere 'tis too late,<br/>Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate!<br/>Changed to a bird, and sent to flit in air,<br/>She dearly pays for Nisus' injured hair!<br/><br/>But when to mischief mortals bend their will,<br/>How soon they find fit instruments of ill!<br/>Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace<br/>A two-edged weapon from her shining case:<br/>So ladies in romance assist their knight,<br/>Present the spear, and arm him for the fight,<br/>He takes the gift with reverence, and extends<br/>The little engine on his fingers' ends:<br/>This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,<br/>As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.<br/>Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,<br/>A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;<br/>And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear;<br/>Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.<br/>Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought<br/>The close recesses of the virgin's thought;<br/>As on the nosegay in her breast reclined,<br/>He watch'd the ideas rising in her mind,<br/>Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,<br/>An earthly lover lurking at her heart.<br/>Amazed, confused, he found his power expired,<br/>Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retired.<br/><br/>The Peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide,<br/>To inclose the lock; now joins it to divide.<br/>Even then, before the fatal engine closed,<br/>A wretched Sylph too fondly interposed;<br/>Fate urged the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,<br/>(But airy substance soon unites again)<br/>The meeting points the sacred hair dissever<br/>From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!<br/><br/>Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,<br/>And screams of horror rend the affrighted skies.<br/>Not louder shrieks to pitying heaven are cast,<br/>When husbands, or when lapdogs breathe their last;<br/>Or when rich China vessels, fallen from high,<br/>In glittering dust and painted fragments lie!<br/><br/>'Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,<br/>(The victor cried) the glorious prize is mine!<br/>While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,<br/>Or in a coach-and-six the British fair,<br/>As long as Atalantis shall be read,<br/>Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed,<br/>While visits shall be paid on solemn days,<br/>When numerous wax-lights in bright order blaze,<br/>While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,<br/>So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!'<br/><br/>What Time would spare, from steel receives its date,<br/>And monuments, like men, submit to fate!<br/>Steel could the labour of the gods destroy,<br/>And strike to dust the imperial towers of Troy;<br/>Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,<br/>And hew triumphal arches to the ground.<br/>What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel,<br/>The conquering force of unresisted steel?<br/><br/>CANTO IV.<br/><br/>But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd,<br/>And secret passions labour'd in her breast.<br/>Not youthful kings in battle seized alive,<br/>Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,<br/>Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss,<br/>Not ancient ladies when refused a kiss,<br/>Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,<br/>Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry,<br/>E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,<br/>As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravish'd hair.<br/><br/>For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew,<br/>And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,<br/>Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,<br/>As ever sullied the fair face of light,<br/>Down to the central earth, his proper scene,<br/>Repair'd, to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.<br/><br/>Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome,<br/>And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome.<br/>No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,<br/>The dreaded east is all the wind that blows;<br/>Here in a grotto, shelter'd close from air,<br/>And screened in shades from day's detested glare,<br/>She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,<br/>Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head.<br/><br/>Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,<br/>But differing far in figure and in face.<br/>Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid,<br/>Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd;<br/>With store of prayers for mornings, nights, and noons<br/>Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons.<br/><br/>There Affectation, with a sickly mien,<br/>Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen;<br/>Practised to lisp, and hang the head aside,<br/>Faints into airs, and languishes with pride;<br/>On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,<br/>Wrapp'd in a gown, for sickness, and for show.<br/>The fair ones feel such maladies as these,<br/>When each new night-dress gives a new disease.<br/><br/>A constant vapour o'er the palace flies,<br/>Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise;<br/>Dreadful, as hermits' dreams in haunted shades,<br/>Or bright, as visions of expiring maids.<br/>Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,<br/>Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:<br/>Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,<br/>And crystal domes, and angels in machines.<br/>Unnumber'd throngs on every side are seen<br/>Of bodies changed to various forms by Spleen.<br/>Here living teapots stand, one arm held out,<br/>One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:<br/>A pipkin there, like Homer's tripod walks;<br/>Here sighs a jar, and there a goose-pie talks;<br/>Men prove with child, as powerful fancy works,<br/>And maids turn'd bottles, call aloud for corks.<br/><br/>Safe pass'd the Gnome through this fantastic band,<br/>A branch of healing spleenwort in his hand.<br/>Then thus address'd the power--'Hail, wayward Queen!<br/>Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:<br/>Parent of vapours and of female wit,<br/>Who give the hysteric, or poetic fit,<br/>On various tempers act by various ways,<br/>Make some take physic, others scribble plays;<br/>Who cause the proud their visits to delay,<br/>And send the godly in a pet to pray;<br/>A nymph there is, that all thy power disdains,<br/>And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.<br/>But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace,<br/>Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,<br/>Like citron-waters matrons' cheeks inflame,<br/>Or change complexions at a losing game;<br/>If e'er with airy horns I planted heads,<br/>Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,<br/>Or caused suspicion when no soul was rude,<br/>Or discomposed the head-dress of a prude,<br/>Or e'er to costive lapdog gave disease,<br/>Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:<br/>Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin,<br/>That single act gives half the world the spleen.'<br/><br/>The goddess with a discontented air<br/>Seems to reject him, though she grants his prayer.<br/>A wondrous bag with both her hands she binds,<br/>Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;<br/>There she collects the force of female lungs,<br/>Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.<br/>A vial next she fills with fainting fears,<br/>Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.<br/>The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,<br/>Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.<br/><br/>Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found,<br/>Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.<br/>Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent,<br/>And all the furies issued at the vent.<br/>Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,<br/>And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.<br/>'O wretched maid!' she spread her hands, and cried,<br/>(While Hampton's echoes 'wretched maid!' replied)<br/>'Was it for this you took such constant care<br/>The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?<br/>For this your locks in paper durance bound,<br/>For this with torturing irons wreath'd around?<br/>For this with fillets strain'd your tender head,<br/>And bravely bore the double loads of lead?<br/>Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,<br/>While the fops envy, and the ladies stare?<br/>Honour forbid! at whose unrivall'd shrine<br/>Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign.<br/>Methinks already I your tears survey,<br/>Already hear the horrid things they say,<br/>Already see you a degraded toast,<br/>And all your honour in a whisper lost!<br/>How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?<br/>'Twill then be infamy to seem your friend!<br/>And shall this prize, the inestimable prize,<br/>Exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes,<br/>And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays,<br/>On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?<br/>Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow,<br/>And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;<br/>Sooner let earth, air, sea to chaos fall,<br/>Men, monkeys, lapdogs, parrots, perish all!'<br/><br/>She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,<br/>And bids her beau demand the precious hairs:<br/>(Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,<br/>And the nice conduct of a clouded cane.)<br/>With earnest eyes, and round, unthinking face,<br/>He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case,<br/>And thus broke out--'My Lord, why, what the devil?<br/>Z--ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!<br/>Plague on't! 'tis past a jest--nay, prithee, pox!<br/>Give her the hair'--he spoke, and rapp'd his box.<br/><br/>'It grieves me much' (replied the Peer again)<br/>Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain;<br/>'But by this lock, this sacred lock I swear,<br/>(Which never more shall join its parted hair;<br/>Which never more its honours shall renew,<br/>Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew)<br/>That while my nostrils draw the vital air,<br/>This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear.'<br/>He spoke, and, speaking, in proud triumph spread<br/>The long-contended honours of her head.<br/><br/>But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so;<br/>He breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow.<br/>Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,<br/>Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears;<br/>On her heaved bosom hung her drooping head,<br/>Which, with a sigh, she raised; and thus she said:<br/><br/>'For ever cursed be this detested day,<br/>Which snatch'd my best, my favourite curl away!<br/>Happy! ah, ten times happy had I been,<br/>If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!<br/>Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,<br/>By love of courts to numerous ills betray'd.<br/>Oh, had I rather unadmired remain'd<br/>In some lone isle, or distant northern land;<br/>Where the gilt chariot never marks the way,<br/>Where none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea!<br/>There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye,<br/>Like roses that in deserts bloom and die.<br/>What moved my mind with youthful lords to roam?<br/>Oh, had I stay'd, and said my prayers at home!<br/>'Twas this the morning omens seem'd to tell:<br/>Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;<br/>The tottering china shook without a wind,<br/>Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!<br/>A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of Fate,<br/>In mystic visions, now believed too late.<br/>See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!<br/>My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares:<br/>These in two sable ringlets taught to break,<br/>Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;<br/>The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,<br/>And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;<br/>Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal shears demands,<br/>And tempts, once more, thy sacrilegious hands.<br/>Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize<br/>Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!'<br/><br/>CANTO V.<br/><br/>She said: the pitying audience melt in tears;<br/>But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears.<br/>In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,<br/>For who can move when fair Belinda fails?<br/>Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain,<br/>While Anna begg'd and Dido raged in vain.<br/>Then grave Clarissa graceful waved her fan;<br/>Silence ensued, and thus the nymph began:<br/><br/>'Say, why are beauties praised and honour'd most,<br/>The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast?<br/>Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford?<br/>Why angels call'd, and angel-like adored?<br/>Why round our coaches crowd the white-gloved beaux?<br/>Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows?<br/>How vain are all these glories, all our pains,<br/>Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:<br/>That men may say, when we the front-box grace,<br/>Behold the first in virtue as in face!<br/>Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,<br/>Charm'd the small-pox, or chased old-age away;<br/>Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce,<br/>Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?<br/>To patch, nay ogle, might become a saint,<br/>Nor could it, sure, be such a sin to paint.<br/>But since, alas! frail beauty must decay,<br/>Curl'd or uncurl'd, since locks will turn to gray;<br/>Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,<br/>And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;<br/>What then remains, but well our power to use,<br/>And keep good-humour still, whate'er we lose?<br/>And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,<br/>When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.<br/>Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;<br/>Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul.'<br/><br/>So spoke the dame, but no applause ensued;<br/>Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her prude.<br/>'To arms, to arms!' the fierce virago cries,<br/>And swift as lightning to the combat flies.<br/>All side in parties, and begin the attack;<br/>Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;<br/>Heroes' and heroines' shouts confusedly rise,<br/>And bass and treble voices strike the skies.<br/>No common weapons in their hands are found,<br/>Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.<br/><br/>So when bold Homer makes the gods engage,<br/>And heavenly breasts with human passions rage;<br/>'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms,<br/>And all Olympus rings with loud alarms:<br/>Jove's thunder roars, heaven trembles all around,<br/>Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound:<br/>Earth shakes her nodding towers, the ground gives way,<br/>And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!<br/><br/>Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height<br/>Clapp'd his glad wings, and sat to view the fight;<br/>Propp'd on their bodkin spears, the sprites survey<br/>The growing combat, or assist the fray.<br/><br/>While through the press enraged Thalestris flies,<br/>And scatters death around from both her eyes,<br/>A beau and witling perish'd in the throng,<br/>One died in metaphor, and one in song.<br/>'O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,'<br/>Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.<br/>A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,<br/>'Those eyes are made so killing!'--was his last.<br/>Thus on Maeander's flowery margin lies<br/>The expiring swan, and as he sings he dies.<br/><br/>When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,<br/>Chloe stepped in, and kill'd him with a frown;<br/>She smiled to see the doughty hero slain,<br/>But, at her smile, the beau revived again.<br/><br/>Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,<br/>Weighs the men's wits against the lady's hair;<br/>The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;<br/>At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.<br/><br/>See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies,<br/>With more than usual lightning in her eyes:<br/>Nor fear'd the chief th' unequal fight to try,<br/>Who sought no more than on his foe to die.<br/>But this bold lord, with manly strength endued,<br/>She with one finger and a thumb subdued:<br/>Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,<br/>A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw;<br/>The Gnomes direct, to every atom just,<br/>The pungent grains of titillating dust.<br/>Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,<br/>And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.<br/>'Now meet thy fate!' incensed Belinda cried,<br/>And drew a deadly bodkin from her side,<br/>(The same, his ancient personage to deck,<br/>Her great-great-grandsire wore about his neck,<br/>In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,<br/>Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown:<br/>Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew,<br/>The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;<br/>Then in a bodkin graced her mother's hairs,<br/>Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.)<br/>'Boast not my fall,' (he cried) 'insulting foe!<br/>Thou by some other shalt be laid as low.<br/>Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind:<br/>All that I dread is leaving you behind!<br/>Rather than so, ah! let me still survive,<br/>And burn in Cupid's flames,--but burn alive.'<br/><br/>'Restore the lock!' she cries; and all around<br/>'Restore the lock!' the vaulted roofs rebound.<br/>Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain<br/>Roar'd for the handkerchief that caused his pain.<br/>But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd,<br/>And chiefs contend till all the prize is lost!<br/>The lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain,<br/>In every place is sought, but sought in vain:<br/>With such a prize no mortal must be blest,<br/>So Heaven decrees! with Heaven who can contest?<br/><br/>Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere,<br/>Since all things lost on earth are treasured there.<br/>There heroes' wits are kept in ponderous vases,<br/>And beaux' in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.<br/>There broken vows, and death-bed alms are found,<br/>And lovers' hearts with ends of ribbon bound,<br/>The courtier's promises, and sick man's prayers,<br/>The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,<br/>Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,<br/>Dried butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.<br/><br/>But trust the Muse--she saw it upward rise,<br/>Though mark'd by none but quick, poetic eyes:<br/>(So Rome's great founder to the heavens withdrew,<br/>To Proculus alone confess'd in view)<br/>A sudden star, it shot through liquid air,<br/>And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.<br/>Not Berenice's locks first rose so bright,<br/>The heaven's bespangling with dishevell'd light.<br/>The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies,<br/>And, pleased, pursue its progress through the skies.<br/><br/>This the beau-monde shall from the Mall survey,<br/>And hail with music its propitious ray.<br/>This the bless'd lover shall for Venus take,<br/>And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake.<br/>This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,<br/>When next he looks through Galileo's eyes;<br/>And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom<br/>The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.<br/><br/>Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd hair,<br/>Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!<br/>Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,<br/>Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost.<br/>For, after all the murders of your eye,<br/>When, after millions slain, yourself shall die;<br/>When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,<br/>And all those tresses shall be laid in dust,<br/>This lock the Muse shall consecrate to fame,<br/>And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name.
