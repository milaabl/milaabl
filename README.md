# üíÆ The Canterbury Tales. The Clerk's Tale. by *Geoffrey Chaucer*

<p>
    THE PROLOGUE.<br/><br/>"SIR Clerk of Oxenford," our Hoste said,<br/>"Ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid<br/>That were new spoused, sitting at the board:<br/>This day I heard not of your tongue a word.<br/>I trow ye study about some sophime:<br/>But Solomon saith, every thing hath time.<br/>For Godde's sake, be of better cheer,<br/>It is no time for to study here.<br/>Tell us some merry tale, by your fay;<br/>For what man that is entered in a play,<br/>He needes must unto that play assent.<br/>But preache not, as friars do in Lent,<br/>To make us for our olde sinnes weep,<br/>Nor that thy tale make us not to sleep.<br/>Tell us some merry thing of aventures.<br/>Your terms, your coloures, and your figures,<br/>Keep them in store, till so be ye indite<br/>High style, as when that men to kinges write.<br/>Speake so plain at this time, I you pray,<br/>That we may understande what ye say."<br/><br/>This worthy Clerk benignely answer'd;<br/>"Hoste," quoth he, "I am under your yerd,<br/>Ye have of us as now the governance,<br/>And therefore would I do you obeisance,<br/>As far as reason asketh, hardily:<br/>I will you tell a tale, which that I<br/>Learn'd at Padova of a worthy clerk,<br/>As proved by his wordes and his werk.<br/>He is now dead, and nailed in his chest,<br/>I pray to God to give his soul good rest.<br/>Francis Petrarc', the laureate poet,<br/>Highte this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet<br/>Illumin'd all Itale of poetry,<br/>As Linian  did of philosophy,<br/>Or law, or other art particulere:<br/>But death, that will not suffer us dwell here<br/>But as it were a twinkling of an eye,<br/>Them both hath slain, and alle we shall die.<br/><br/>"But forth to tellen of this worthy man,<br/>That taughte me this tale, as I began,<br/>I say that first he with high style inditeth<br/>(Ere he the body of his tale writeth)<br/>A proem, in the which describeth he<br/>Piedmont, and of Saluces  the country,<br/>And speaketh of the Pennine hilles high,<br/>That be the bounds of all West Lombardy:<br/>And of Mount Vesulus in special,<br/>Where as the Po out of a welle small<br/>Taketh his firste springing and his source,<br/>That eastward aye increaseth in his course<br/>T'Emilia-ward,  to Ferraro, and Venice,<br/>The which a long thing were to devise.<br/>And truely, as to my judgement,<br/>Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,<br/>Save that he would conveye his mattere:<br/>But this is the tale, which that ye shall hear."<br/><br/>THE TALE.<br/><br/>Pars Prima.<br/><br/>There is, right at the west side of Itale,<br/>Down at the root of Vesulus the cold,<br/>A lusty plain, abundant of vitaille;<br/>There many a town and tow'r thou may'st behold,<br/>That founded were in time of fathers old,<br/>And many another delectable sight;<br/>And Saluces this noble country hight.<br/><br/>A marquis whilom lord was of that land,<br/>As were his worthy elders him before,<br/>And obedient, aye ready to his hand,<br/>Were all his lieges, bothe less and more:<br/>Thus in delight he liv'd, and had done yore,<br/>Belov'd and drad, through favour of fortune,<br/>Both of his lordes and of his commune.<br/><br/>Therewith he was, to speak of lineage,<br/>The gentilest y-born of Lombardy,<br/>A fair person, and strong, and young of age,<br/>And full of honour and of courtesy:<br/>Discreet enough his country for to gie,<br/>Saving in some things that he was to blame;<br/>And Walter was this younge lordes name.<br/><br/>I blame him thus, that he consider'd not<br/>In time coming what might him betide,<br/>But on his present lust was all his thought,<br/>And for to hawk and hunt on every side;<br/>Well nigh all other cares let he slide,<br/>And eke he would (that was the worst of all)<br/>Wedde no wife for aught that might befall.<br/><br/>Only that point his people bare so sore,<br/>That flockmel on a day to him they went,<br/>And one of them, that wisest was of lore<br/>(Or elles that the lord would best assent<br/>That he should tell him what the people meant,<br/>Or elles could he well shew such mattere),<br/>He to the marquis said as ye shall hear.<br/><br/>"O noble Marquis! your humanity<br/>Assureth us and gives us hardiness,<br/>As oft as time is of necessity,<br/>That we to you may tell our heaviness:<br/>Accepte, Lord, now of your gentleness,<br/>What we with piteous heart unto you plain,<br/>And let your ears my voice not disdain.<br/><br/>"All have I nought to do in this mattere<br/>More than another man hath in this place,<br/>Yet forasmuch as ye, my Lord so dear,<br/>Have always shewed me favour and grace,<br/>I dare the better ask of you a space<br/>Of audience, to shewen our request,<br/>And ye, my Lord, to do right as you lest.<br/><br/>"For certes, Lord, so well us like you<br/>And all your work, and ev'r have done, that we<br/>Ne coulde not ourselves devise how<br/>We mighte live in more felicity:<br/>Save one thing, Lord, if that your will it be,<br/>That for to be a wedded man you lest;<br/>Then were your people in sovereign hearte's rest.<br/><br/>"Bowe your neck under the blissful yoke<br/>Of sovereignty, and not of service,<br/>Which that men call espousal or wedlock:<br/>And thinke, Lord, among your thoughtes wise,<br/>How that our dayes pass in sundry wise;<br/>For though we sleep, or wake, or roam, or ride,<br/>Aye fleeth time, it will no man abide.<br/><br/>"And though your greene youthe flow'r as yet,<br/>In creepeth age always as still as stone,<br/>And death menaceth every age, and smit<br/>In each estate, for there escapeth none:<br/>And all so certain as we know each one<br/>That we shall die, as uncertain we all<br/>Be of that day when death shall on us fall.<br/><br/>"Accepte then of us the true intent,<br/>That never yet refused youre hest,<br/>And we will, Lord, if that ye will assent,<br/>Choose you a wife, in short time at the lest,<br/>Born of the gentilest and of the best<br/>Of all this land, so that it ought to seem<br/>Honour to God and you, as we can deem.<br/><br/>"Deliver us out of all this busy dread,<br/>And take a wife, for highe Godde's sake:<br/>For if it so befell, as God forbid,<br/>That through your death your lineage should slake,<br/>And that a strange successor shoulde take<br/>Your heritage, oh! woe were us on live:<br/>Wherefore we pray you hastily to wive."<br/><br/>Their meeke prayer and their piteous cheer<br/>Made the marquis for to have pity.<br/>"Ye will," quoth he, "mine owen people dear,<br/>To that I ne'er ere thought constraine me.<br/>I me rejoiced of my liberty,<br/>That seldom time is found in rnarriage;<br/>Where I was free, I must be in servage!<br/><br/>"But natheless I see your true intent,<br/>And trust upon your wit, and have done aye:<br/>Wherefore of my free will I will assent<br/>To wedde me, as soon as e'er I may.<br/>But whereas ye have proffer'd me to-day<br/>To choose me a wife, I you release<br/>That choice, and pray you of that proffer cease.<br/><br/>"For God it wot, that children often been<br/>Unlike their worthy elders them before,<br/>Bounte comes all of God, not of the strene<br/>Of which they be engender'd and y-bore:<br/>I trust in Godde's bounte, and therefore<br/>My marriage, and mine estate and rest,<br/>I him betake; he may do as him lest.<br/><br/>"Let me alone in choosing of my wife;<br/>That charge upon my back I will endure:<br/>But I you pray, and charge upon your life,<br/>That what wife that I take, ye me assure<br/>To worship her, while that her life may dure,<br/>In word and work both here and elleswhere,<br/>As she an emperore's daughter were.<br/><br/>"And farthermore this shall ye swear, that ye<br/>Against my choice shall never grudge nor strive.<br/>For since I shall forego my liberty<br/>At your request, as ever may I thrive,<br/>Where as mine heart is set, there will I live<br/>And but ye will assent in such mannere,<br/>I pray you speak no more of this mattere."<br/><br/>With heartly will they sworen and assent<br/>To all this thing, there said not one wight nay:<br/>Beseeching him of grace, ere that they went,<br/>That he would grante them a certain day<br/>Of his espousal, soon as e'er he rnay,<br/>For yet always the people somewhat dread<br/>Lest that the marquis woulde no wife wed.<br/><br/>He granted them a day, such as him lest,<br/>On which he would be wedded sickerly,<br/>And said he did all this at their request;<br/>And they with humble heart full buxomly,<br/>Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,<br/>Him thanked all; and thus they have an end<br/>Of their intent, and home again they wend.<br/><br/>And hereupon he to his officers<br/>Commanded for the feaste to purvey.<br/>And to his privy knightes and squiers<br/>Such charge he gave, as him list on them lay:<br/>And they to his commandement obey,<br/>And each of them doth all his diligence<br/>To do unto the feast all reverence.<br/><br/>Pars Secunda<br/><br/>Not far from thilke palace honourable,<br/>Where as this marquis shope his marriage,<br/>There stood a thorp, of sighte delectable,<br/>In which the poore folk of that village<br/>Hadde their beastes and their harbourage,<br/>And of their labour took their sustenance,<br/>After the earthe gave them abundance.<br/><br/>Among this poore folk there dwelt a man<br/>Which that was holden poorest of them all;<br/>But highe God sometimes sende can<br/>His grace unto a little ox's stall;<br/>Janicola men of that thorp him call.<br/>A daughter had he, fair enough to sight,<br/>And Griseldis this younge maiden hight.<br/><br/>But for to speak of virtuous beauty,<br/>Then was she one the fairest under sun:<br/>Full poorely y-foster'd up was she;<br/>No likerous lust was in her heart y-run;<br/>Well ofter of the well than of the tun<br/>She drank,  and, for she woulde virtue please<br/>She knew well labour, but no idle ease.<br/><br/>But though this maiden tender were of age;<br/>Yet in the breast of her virginity<br/>There was inclos'd a sad and ripe corage;<br/>And in great reverence and charity<br/>Her olde poore father foster'd she.<br/>A few sheep, spinning, on the field she kept,<br/>She woulde not be idle till she slept.<br/><br/>And when she homeward came, she would bring<br/>Wortes, and other herbes, times oft,<br/>The which she shred and seeth'd for her living,<br/>And made her bed full hard, and nothing soft:<br/>And aye she kept her father's life on loft<br/>With ev'ry obeisance and diligence,<br/>That child may do to father's reverence.<br/><br/>Upon Griselda, this poor creature,<br/>Full often sithes this marquis set his eye,<br/>As he on hunting rode, paraventure:<br/>And when it fell that he might her espy,<br/>He not with wanton looking of folly<br/>His eyen cast on her, but in sad wise<br/>Upon her cheer he would him oft advise;<br/><br/>Commending in his heart her womanhead,<br/>And eke her virtue, passing any wight<br/>Of so young age, as well in cheer as deed.<br/>For though the people have no great insight<br/>In virtue, he considered full right<br/>Her bounte, and disposed that he would<br/>Wed only her, if ever wed he should.<br/><br/>The day of wedding came, but no wight can<br/>Telle what woman that it shoulde be;<br/>For which marvail wonder'd many a man,<br/>And saide, when they were in privity,<br/>"Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?<br/>Will he not wed?  Alas, alas the while!<br/>Why will he thus himself and us beguile?"<br/><br/>But natheless this marquis had done make<br/>Of gemmes, set in gold and in azure,<br/>Brooches and ringes, for Griselda's sake,<br/>And of her clothing took he the measure<br/>Of a maiden like unto her stature,<br/>And eke of other ornamentes all<br/>That unto such a wedding shoulde fall.<br/><br/>The time of undern of the same day<br/>Approached, that this wedding shoulde be,<br/>And all the palace put was in array,<br/>Both hall and chamber, each in its degree,<br/>Houses of office stuffed with plenty<br/>There may'st thou see of dainteous vitaille,<br/>That may be found, as far as lasts Itale.<br/><br/>This royal marquis, richely array'd,<br/>Lordes and ladies in his company,<br/>The which unto the feaste were pray'd,<br/>And of his retinue the bach'lery,<br/>With many a sound of sundry melody,<br/>Unto the village, of the which I told,<br/>In this array the right way did they hold.<br/><br/>Griseld' of this (God wot) full innocent,<br/>That for her shapen was all this array,<br/>To fetche water at a well is went,<br/>And home she came as soon as e'er she may.<br/>For well she had heard say, that on that day<br/>The marquis shoulde wed, and, if she might,<br/>She fain would have seen somewhat of that sight.<br/><br/>She thought, "I will with other maidens stand,<br/>That be my fellows, in our door, and see<br/>The marchioness; and therefore will I fand<br/>To do at home, as soon as it may be,<br/>The labour which belongeth unto me,<br/>And then I may at leisure her behold,<br/>If she this way unto the castle hold."<br/><br/>And as she would over the threshold gon,<br/>The marquis came and gan for her to call,<br/>And she set down her water-pot anon<br/>Beside the threshold, in an ox's stall,<br/>And down upon her knees she gan to fall,<br/>And with sad countenance kneeled still,<br/>Till she had heard what was the lorde's will.<br/><br/>The thoughtful marquis spake unto the maid<br/>Full soberly, and said in this mannere:<br/>"Where is your father, Griseldis?" he said.<br/>And she with reverence, in humble cheer,<br/>Answered, "Lord, he is all ready here."<br/>And in she went withoute longer let<br/>And to the marquis she her father fet.<br/><br/>He by the hand then took the poore man,<br/>And saide thus, when he him had aside:<br/>"Janicola, I neither may nor can<br/>Longer the pleasance of mine hearte hide;<br/>If that thou vouchesafe, whatso betide,<br/>Thy daughter will I take, ere that I wend,<br/>As for my wife, unto her life's end.<br/><br/>"Thou lovest me, that know I well certain,<br/>And art my faithful liegeman y-bore,<br/>And all that liketh me, I dare well sayn<br/>It liketh thee; and specially therefore<br/>Tell me that point, that I have said before, --<br/>If that thou wilt unto this purpose draw,<br/>To take me as for thy son-in-law."<br/><br/>This sudden case the man astonied so,<br/>That red he wax'd, abash'd, and all quaking<br/>He stood; unnethes said he wordes mo',<br/>But only thus; "Lord," quoth he, "my willing<br/>Is as ye will, nor against your liking<br/>I will no thing, mine owen lord so dear;<br/>Right as you list governe this mattere."<br/><br/>"Then will I," quoth the marquis softely,<br/>"That in thy chamber I, and thou, and she,<br/>Have a collation; and know'st thou why?<br/>For I will ask her, if her will it be<br/>To be my wife, and rule her after me:<br/>And all this shall be done in thy presence,<br/>I will not speak out of thine audience."<br/><br/>And in the chamber while they were about<br/>The treaty, which ye shall hereafter hear,<br/>The people came into the house without,<br/>And wonder'd them in how honest mannere<br/>And tenderly she kept her father dear;<br/>But utterly Griseldis wonder might,<br/>For never erst ne saw she such a sight.<br/><br/>No wonder is though that she be astoned,<br/>To see so great a guest come in that place,<br/>She never was to no such guestes woned;<br/>For which she looked with full pale face.<br/>But shortly forth this matter for to chase,<br/>These are the wordes that the marquis said<br/>To this benigne, very, faithful maid.<br/><br/>"Griseld'," he said, "ye shall well understand,<br/>It liketh to your father and to me<br/>That I you wed, and eke it may so stand,<br/>As I suppose ye will that it so be:<br/>But these demandes ask I first," quoth he,<br/>"Since that it shall be done in hasty wise;<br/>Will ye assent, or elles you advise?<br/><br/>"I say this, be ye ready with good heart<br/>To all my lust, and that I freely may,<br/>As me best thinketh, do you laugh or smart,<br/>And never ye to grudge, night nor day,<br/>And eke when I say Yea, ye say not Nay,<br/>Neither by word, nor frowning countenance?<br/>Swear this, and here I swear our alliance."<br/><br/>Wond'ring upon this word, quaking for dread,<br/>She saide; "Lord, indigne and unworthy<br/>Am I to this honour that ye me bede,<br/>But as ye will yourself, right so will I:<br/>And here I swear, that never willingly<br/>In word or thought I will you disobey,<br/>For to be dead; though me were loth to dey."<br/><br/>"This is enough, Griselda mine," quoth he.<br/>And forth he went with a full sober cheer,<br/>Out at the door, and after then came she,<br/>And to the people he said in this mannere:<br/>"This is my wife," quoth he, "that standeth here.<br/>Honoure her, and love her, I you pray,<br/>Whoso me loves; there is no more to say."<br/><br/>And, for that nothing of her olde gear<br/>She shoulde bring into his house, he bade<br/>That women should despoile her right there;<br/>Of which these ladies were nothing glad<br/>To handle her clothes wherein she was clad:<br/>But natheless this maiden bright of hue<br/>From foot to head they clothed have all new.<br/><br/>Her haires have they comb'd that lay untress'd<br/>Full rudely, and with their fingers small<br/>A crown upon her head they have dress'd,<br/>And set her full of nouches  great and small:<br/>Of her array why should I make a tale?<br/>Unneth the people her knew for her fairness,<br/>When she transmuted was in such richess.<br/><br/>The marquis hath her spoused with a ring<br/>Brought for the same cause, and then her set<br/>Upon a horse snow-white, and well ambling,<br/>And to his palace, ere he longer let<br/>With joyful people, that her led and met,<br/>Conveyed her; and thus the day they spend<br/>In revel, till the sunne gan descend.<br/><br/>And, shortly forth this tale for to chase,<br/>I say, that to this newe marchioness<br/>God hath such favour sent her of his grace,<br/>That it ne seemed not by likeliness<br/>That she was born and fed in rudeness, --<br/>As in a cot, or in an ox's stall, --<br/>But nourish'd in an emperore's hall.<br/><br/>To every wight she waxen is so dear<br/>And worshipful, that folk where she was born,<br/>That from her birthe knew her year by year,<br/>Unnethes trowed they, but durst have sworn,<br/>That to Janicol' of whom I spake before,<br/>She was not daughter, for by conjecture<br/>Them thought she was another creature.<br/><br/>For though that ever virtuous was she,<br/>She was increased in such excellence<br/>Of thewes good, y-set in high bounte,<br/>And so discreet, and fair of eloquence,<br/>So benign, and so digne of reverence,<br/>And coulde so the people's heart embrace,<br/>That each her lov'd that looked on her face.<br/><br/>Not only of Saluces in the town<br/>Published was the bounte of her name,<br/>But eke besides in many a regioun;<br/>If one said well, another said the same:<br/>So spread of here high bounte the fame,<br/>That men and women, young as well as old,<br/>Went to Saluces, her for to behold.<br/><br/>Thus Walter lowly, -- nay, but royally,-<br/>Wedded with fortn'ate honestete,<br/>In Godde's peace lived full easily<br/>At home, and outward grace enough had he:<br/>And, for he saw that under low degree<br/>Was honest virtue hid, the people him held<br/>A prudent man, and that is seen full seld'.<br/><br/>Not only this Griseldis through her wit<br/>Couth all the feat of wifely homeliness,<br/>But eke, when that the case required it,<br/>The common profit coulde she redress:<br/>There n'as discord, rancour, nor heaviness<br/>In all the land, that she could not appease,<br/>And wisely bring them all in rest and ease<br/><br/>Though that her husband absent were or non,<br/>If gentlemen or other of that country,<br/>Were wroth, she woulde bringe them at one,<br/>So wise and ripe wordes hadde she,<br/>And judgement of so great equity,<br/>That she from heaven sent was, as men wend,<br/>People to save, and every wrong t'amend<br/><br/>Not longe time after that this Griseld'<br/>Was wedded, she a daughter had y-bore;<br/>All she had lever borne a knave child,<br/>Glad was the marquis and his folk therefore;<br/>For, though a maiden child came all before,<br/>She may unto a knave child attain<br/>By likelihood, since she is not barren.<br/><br/>Pars Tertia.<br/><br/>There fell, as falleth many times mo',<br/>When that his child had sucked but a throw,<br/>This marquis in his hearte longed so<br/>To tempt his wife, her sadness for to know,<br/>That he might not out of his hearte throw<br/>This marvellous desire his wife t'asssay;<br/>Needless, God wot, he thought her to affray.<br/><br/>He had assayed her anough before,<br/>And found her ever good; what needed it<br/>Her for to tempt, and always more and more?<br/>Though some men praise it for a subtle wit,<br/>But as for me, I say that evil it sit<br/>T'assay a wife when that it is no need,<br/>And putte her in anguish and in dread.<br/><br/>For which this marquis wrought in this mannere:<br/>He came at night alone there as she lay,<br/>With sterne face and with full troubled cheer,<br/>And saide thus; "Griseld'," quoth he "that day<br/>That I you took out of your poor array,<br/>And put you in estate of high nobless,<br/>Ye have it not forgotten, as I guess.<br/><br/>"I say, Griseld', this present dignity,<br/>In which that I have put you, as I trow<br/>Maketh you not forgetful for to be<br/>That I you took in poor estate full low,<br/>For any weal you must yourselfe know.<br/>Take heed of every word that I you say,<br/>There is no wight that hears it but we tway.<br/><br/>"Ye know yourself well how that ye came here<br/>Into this house, it is not long ago;<br/>And though to me ye be right lefe and dear,<br/>Unto my gentles ye be nothing so:<br/>They say, to them it is great shame and woe<br/>For to be subject, and be in servage,<br/>To thee, that born art of small lineage.<br/><br/>"And namely since thy daughter was y-bore<br/>These wordes have they spoken doubteless;<br/>But I desire, as I have done before,<br/>To live my life with them in rest and peace:<br/>I may not in this case be reckeless;<br/>I must do with thy daughter for the best,<br/>Not as I would, but as my gentles lest.<br/><br/>"And yet, God wot, this is full loth to me:<br/>But natheless withoute your weeting<br/>I will nought do; but this will I," quoth he,<br/>"That ye to me assenten in this thing.<br/>Shew now your patience in your working,<br/>That ye me hight and swore in your village<br/>The day that maked was our marriage."<br/><br/>When she had heard all this, she not amev'd<br/>Neither in word, in cheer, nor countenance<br/>(For, as it seemed, she was not aggriev'd);<br/>She saide; "Lord, all lies in your pleasance,<br/>My child and I, with hearty obeisance<br/>Be youres all, and ye may save or spill<br/>Your owen thing: work then after your will.<br/><br/>"There may no thing, so God my soule save,<br/>Like to you, that may displease me:<br/>Nor I desire nothing for to have,<br/>Nor dreade for to lose, save only ye:<br/>This will is in mine heart, and aye shall be,<br/>No length of time, nor death, may this deface,<br/>Nor change my corage to another place."<br/><br/>Glad was the marquis for her answering,<br/>But yet he feigned as he were not so;<br/>All dreary was his cheer and his looking<br/>When that he should out of the chamber go.<br/>Soon after this, a furlong way or two,<br/>He privily hath told all his intent<br/>Unto a man, and to his wife him sent.<br/><br/>A manner sergeant was this private man,<br/>The which he faithful often founden had<br/>In thinges great, and eke such folk well can<br/>Do execution in thinges bad:<br/>The lord knew well, that he him loved and drad.<br/>And when this sergeant knew his lorde's will,<br/>Into the chamber stalked he full still.<br/><br/>"Madam," he said, "ye must forgive it me,<br/>Though I do thing to which I am constrain'd;<br/>Ye be so wise, that right well knowe ye<br/>That lordes' hestes may not be y-feign'd;<br/>They may well be bewailed and complain'd,<br/>But men must needs unto their lust obey;<br/>And so will I, there is no more to say.<br/><br/>"This child I am commanded for to take."<br/>And spake no more, but out the child he hent<br/>Dispiteously, and gan a cheer to make<br/>As though he would have slain it ere he went.<br/>Griseldis must all suffer and consent:<br/>And as a lamb she sat there meek and still,<br/>And let this cruel sergeant do his will<br/><br/>Suspicious was the diffame of this man,<br/>Suspect his face, suspect his word also,<br/>Suspect the time in which he this began:<br/>Alas! her daughter, that she loved so,<br/>She weened he would have it slain right tho,<br/>But natheless she neither wept nor siked,<br/>Conforming her to what the marquis liked.<br/><br/>But at the last to speake she began,<br/>And meekly she unto the sergeant pray'd,<br/>So as he was a worthy gentle man,<br/>That she might kiss her child, ere that it died:<br/>And in her barme this little child she laid,<br/>With full sad face, and gan the child to bless,<br/>And lulled it, and after gan it kiss.<br/><br/>And thus she said in her benigne voice:<br/>Farewell, my child, I shall thee never see;<br/>But since I have thee marked with the cross,<br/>Of that father y-blessed may'st thou be<br/>That for us died upon a cross of tree:<br/>Thy soul, my little child, I him betake,<br/>For this night shalt thou dien for my sake.<br/><br/>I trow that to a norice in this case<br/>It had been hard this ruthe for to see:<br/>Well might a mother then have cried, "Alas!"<br/>But natheless so sad steadfast was she,<br/>That she endured all adversity,<br/>And to the sergeant meekely she said,<br/>"Have here again your little younge maid.<br/><br/>"Go now," quoth she, "and do my lord's behest.<br/>And one thing would I pray you of your grace,<br/>But if my lord forbade you at the least,<br/>Bury this little body in some place,<br/>That neither beasts nor birdes it arace."<br/>But he no word would to that purpose say,<br/>But took the child and went upon his way.<br/><br/>The sergeant came unto his lord again,<br/>And of Griselda's words and of her cheer<br/>He told him point for point, in short and plain,<br/>And him presented with his daughter dear.<br/>Somewhat this lord had ruth in his mannere,<br/>But natheless his purpose held he still,<br/>As lordes do, when they will have their will;<br/><br/>And bade this sergeant that he privily<br/>Shoulde the child full softly wind and wrap,<br/>With alle circumstances tenderly,<br/>And carry it in a coffer, or in lap;<br/>But, upon pain his head off for to swap,<br/>That no man shoulde know of his intent,<br/>Nor whence he came, nor whither that he went;<br/><br/>But at Bologna, to his sister dear,<br/>That at that time of Panic' was Countess,<br/>He should it take, and shew her this mattere,<br/>Beseeching her to do her business<br/>This child to foster in all gentleness,<br/>And whose child it was he bade her hide<br/>From every wight, for aught that might betide.<br/><br/>The sergeant went, and hath fulfill'd this thing.<br/>But to the marquis now returne we;<br/>For now went he full fast imagining<br/>If by his wife's cheer he mighte see,<br/>Or by her wordes apperceive, that she<br/>Were changed; but he never could her find,<br/>But ever-in-one alike sad and kind.<br/><br/>As glad, as humble, as busy in service,<br/>And eke in love, as she was wont to be,<br/>Was she to him, in every manner wise;<br/>And of her daughter not a word spake she;<br/>No accident for no adversity<br/>Was seen in her, nor e'er her daughter's name<br/>She named, or in earnest or in game.<br/><br/>Pars Quarta<br/><br/>In this estate there passed be four year<br/>Ere she with childe was; but, as God wo'ld,<br/>A knave child she bare by this Waltere,<br/>Full gracious and fair for to behold;<br/>And when that folk it to his father told,<br/>Not only he, but all his country, merry<br/>Were for this child, and God they thank and hery.<br/><br/>When it was two year old, and from the breast<br/>Departed of the norice, on a day<br/>This marquis caughte yet another lest<br/>To tempt his wife yet farther, if he may.<br/>Oh! needless was she tempted in as say;<br/>But wedded men not connen no measure,<br/>When that they find a patient creature.<br/><br/>"Wife," quoth the marquis, "ye have heard ere this<br/>My people sickly bear our marriage;<br/>And namely since my son y-boren is,<br/>Now is it worse than ever in all our age:<br/>The murmur slays mine heart and my corage,<br/>For to mine ears cometh the voice so smart,<br/>That it well nigh destroyed hath mine heart.<br/><br/>"Now say they thus, 'When Walter is y-gone,<br/>Then shall the blood of Janicol' succeed,<br/>And be our lord, for other have we none:'<br/>Such wordes say my people, out of drede.<br/>Well ought I of such murmur take heed,<br/>For certainly I dread all such sentence,<br/>Though they not plainen in mine audience.<br/><br/>"I woulde live in peace, if that I might;<br/>Wherefore I am disposed utterly,<br/>As I his sister served ere by night,<br/>Right so think I to serve him privily.<br/>This warn I you, that ye not suddenly<br/>Out of yourself for no woe should outraie;<br/>Be patient, and thereof I you pray."<br/><br/>"I have," quoth she, "said thus, and ever shall,<br/>I will no thing, nor n'ill no thing, certain,<br/>But as you list; not grieveth me at all<br/>Though that my daughter and my son be slain<br/>At your commandement; that is to sayn,<br/>I have not had no part of children twain,<br/>But first sickness, and after woe and pain.<br/><br/>"Ye be my lord, do with your owen thing<br/>Right as you list, and ask no rede of me:<br/>For, as I left at home all my clothing<br/>When I came first to you, right so," quoth she,<br/>"Left I my will and all my liberty,<br/>And took your clothing: wherefore I you pray,<br/>Do your pleasance, I will your lust obey.<br/><br/>"And, certes, if I hadde prescience<br/>Your will to know, ere ye your lust me told,<br/>I would it do withoute negligence:<br/>But, now I know your lust, and what ye wo'ld,<br/>All your pleasance firm and stable I hold;<br/>For, wist I that my death might do you ease,<br/>Right gladly would I dien you to please.<br/><br/>"Death may not make no comparisoun<br/>Unto your love." And when this marquis say<br/>The constance of his wife,  he cast adown<br/>His eyen two, and wonder'd how she may<br/>In patience suffer all this array;<br/>And forth he went with dreary countenance;<br/>But to his heart it was full great pleasance.<br/><br/>This ugly sergeant, in the same wise<br/>That he her daughter caught, right so hath he<br/>(Or worse, if men can any worse devise,)<br/>Y-hent her son, that full was of beauty:<br/>And ever-in-one so patient was she,<br/>That she no cheere made of heaviness,<br/>But kiss'd her son, and after gan him bless.<br/><br/>Save this she prayed him, if that he might,<br/>Her little son he would in earthe grave,<br/>His tender limbes, delicate to sight,<br/>From fowles and from beastes for to save.<br/>But she none answer of him mighte have;<br/>He went his way, as him nothing ne raught,<br/>But to Bologna tenderly it brought.<br/><br/>The marquis wonder'd ever longer more<br/>Upon her patience; and, if that he<br/>Not hadde soothly knowen therebefore<br/>That perfectly her children loved she,<br/>He would have ween'd that of some subtilty,<br/>And of malice, or for cruel corage,<br/>She hadde suffer'd this with sad visage.<br/><br/>But well he knew, that, next himself, certain<br/>She lov'd her children best in every wise.<br/>But now of women would I aske fain,<br/>If these assayes mighte not suffice?<br/>What could a sturdy husband more devise<br/>To prove her wifehood and her steadfastness,<br/>And he continuing ev'r in sturdiness?<br/><br/>But there be folk of such condition,<br/>That, when they have a certain purpose take,<br/>Thiey cannot stint of their intention,<br/>But, right as they were bound unto a stake,<br/>They will not of their firste purpose slake:<br/>Right so this marquis fully hath purpos'd<br/>To tempt his wife, as he was first dispos'd.<br/><br/>He waited, if by word or countenance<br/>That she to him was changed of corage:<br/>But never could he finde variance,<br/>She was aye one in heart and in visage,<br/>And aye the farther that she was in age,<br/>The more true (if that it were possible)<br/>She was to him in love, and more penible.<br/><br/>For which it seemed thus, that of them two<br/>There was but one will; for, as Walter lest,<br/>The same pleasance was her lust also;<br/>And, God be thanked, all fell for the best.<br/>She shewed well, for no worldly unrest,<br/>A wife as of herself no thinge should<br/>Will, in effect, but as her husbaud would.<br/><br/>The sland'r of Walter wondrous wide sprad,<br/>That of a cruel heart he wickedly,<br/>For he a poore woman wedded had,<br/>Had murder'd both his children privily:<br/>Such murmur was among them commonly.<br/>No wonder is: for to the people's ear<br/>There came no word, but that they murder'd were.<br/><br/>For which, whereas his people therebefore<br/>Had lov'd him well, the sland'r of his diffame<br/>Made them that they him hated therefore.<br/>To be a murd'rer is a hateful name.<br/>But natheless, for earnest or for game,<br/>He of his cruel purpose would not stent;<br/>To tempt his wife was set all his intent.<br/><br/>When that his daughter twelve year was of age,<br/>He to the Court of Rome, in subtle wise<br/>Informed of his will, sent his message,<br/>Commanding him such bulles to devise<br/>As to his cruel purpose may suffice,<br/>How that the Pope, for his people's rest,<br/>Bade him to wed another, if him lest.<br/><br/>I say he bade they shoulde counterfeit<br/>The Pope's bulles, making mention<br/>That he had leave his firste wife to lete,<br/>To stinte rancour and dissension<br/>Betwixt his people and him: thus spake the bull,<br/>The which they have published at full.<br/><br/>The rude people, as no wonder is,<br/>Weened full well that it had been right so:<br/>But, when these tidings came to Griseldis.<br/>I deeme that her heart was full of woe;<br/>But she, alike sad for evermo',<br/>Disposed was, this humble creature,<br/>Th' adversity of fortune all t' endure;<br/><br/>Abiding ever his lust and his pleasance,<br/>To whom that she was given, heart and all,<br/>As to her very worldly suffisance.<br/>But, shortly if this story tell I shall,<br/>The marquis written hath in special<br/>A letter, in which he shewed his intent,<br/>And secretly it to Bologna sent.<br/><br/>To th' earl of Panico, which hadde tho<br/>Wedded his sister, pray'd he specially<br/>To bringe home again his children two<br/>In honourable estate all openly:<br/>But one thing he him prayed utterly,<br/>That he to no wight, though men would inquere,<br/>Shoulde not tell whose children that they were,<br/><br/>But say, the maiden should y-wedded be<br/>Unto the marquis of Saluce anon.<br/>And as this earl was prayed, so did he,<br/>For, at day set, he on his way is gone<br/>Toward Saluce, and lorde's many a one<br/>In rich array, this maiden for to guide, --<br/>Her younge brother riding her beside.<br/><br/>Arrayed was toward her marriage<br/>This freshe maiden, full of gemmes clear;<br/>Her brother, which that seven year was of age,<br/>Arrayed eke full fresh in his mannere:<br/>And thus, in great nobless, and with glad cheer,<br/>Toward Saluces shaping their journey,<br/>From day to day they rode upon their way.<br/><br/>Pars Quinta.<br/><br/>Among all this, after his wick' usage,<br/>The marquis, yet his wife to tempte more<br/>To the uttermost proof of her corage,<br/>Fully to have experience and lore<br/>If that she were as steadfast as before,<br/>He on a day, in open audience,<br/>Full boisterously said her this sentence:<br/><br/>"Certes, Griseld', I had enough pleasance<br/>To have you to my wife, for your goodness,<br/>And for your truth, and for your obeisance,<br/>Not for your lineage, nor for your richess;<br/>But now know I, in very soothfastness,<br/>That in great lordship, if I well advise,<br/>There is great servitude in sundry wise.<br/><br/>"I may not do as every ploughman may:<br/>My people me constraineth for to take<br/>Another wife, and cryeth day by day;<br/>And eke the Pope, rancour for to slake,<br/>Consenteth it, that dare I undertake:<br/>And truely, thus much I will you say,<br/>My newe wife is coming by the way.<br/><br/>"Be strong of heart, and void anon her place;<br/>And thilke dower that ye brought to me,<br/>Take it again, I grant it of my grace.<br/>Returne to your father's house," quoth he;<br/>"No man may always have prosperity;<br/>With even heart I rede you to endure<br/>The stroke of fortune or of aventure."<br/><br/>And she again answer'd in patience:<br/>"My Lord," quoth she, "I know, and knew alway,<br/>How that betwixte your magnificence<br/>And my povert' no wight nor can nor may<br/>Make comparison, it is no nay;<br/>I held me never digne in no mannere<br/>To be your wife, nor yet your chamberere.<br/><br/>"And in this house, where ye me lady made,<br/>(The highe God take I for my witness,<br/>And all so wisly he my soule glade),<br/>I never held me lady nor mistress,<br/>But humble servant to your worthiness,<br/>And ever shall, while that my life may dure,<br/>Aboven every worldly creature.<br/><br/>"That ye so long, of your benignity,<br/>Have holden me in honour and nobley,<br/>Where as I was not worthy for to be,<br/>That thank I God and you, to whom I pray<br/>Foryield it you; there is no more to say:<br/>Unto my father gladly will I wend,<br/>And with him dwell, unto my lifes end,<br/><br/>"Where I was foster'd as a child full small,<br/>Till I be dead my life there will I lead,<br/>A widow clean in body, heart, and all.<br/>For since I gave to you my maidenhead,<br/>And am your true wife, it is no dread,<br/>God shielde such a lordes wife to take<br/>Another man to husband or to make.<br/><br/>"And of your newe wife, God of his grace<br/>So grant you weal and all prosperity:<br/>For I will gladly yield to her my place,<br/>In which that I was blissful wont to be.<br/>For since it liketh you, my Lord," quoth she,<br/>"That whilom weren all mine hearte's rest,<br/>That I shall go, I will go when you lest.<br/><br/>"But whereas ye me proffer such dowaire<br/>As I first brought, it is well in my mind,<br/>It was my wretched clothes, nothing fair,<br/>The which to me were hard now for to find.<br/>O goode God! how gentle and how kind<br/>Ye seemed by your speech and your visage,<br/>The day that maked was our marriage!<br/><br/>"But sooth is said, -- algate I find it true,<br/>For in effect it proved is on me, --<br/>Love is not old as when that it is new.<br/>But certes, Lord, for no adversity,<br/>To dien in this case, it shall not be<br/>That e'er in word or work I shall repent<br/>That I you gave mine heart in whole intent.<br/><br/>"My Lord, ye know that in my father's place<br/>Ye did me strip out of my poore weed,<br/>And richely ye clad me of your grace;<br/>To you brought I nought elles, out of dread,<br/>But faith, and nakedness, and maidenhead;<br/>And here again your clothing I restore,<br/>And eke your wedding ring for evermore.<br/><br/>"The remnant of your jewels ready be<br/>Within your chamber, I dare safely sayn:<br/>Naked out of my father's house," quoth she,<br/>"I came, and naked I must turn again.<br/>All your pleasance would I follow fain:<br/>But yet I hope it be not your intent<br/>That smockless I out of your palace went.<br/><br/>"Ye could not do so dishonest a thing,<br/>That thilke womb, in which your children lay,<br/>Shoulde before the people, in my walking,<br/>Be seen all bare: and therefore I you pray,<br/>Let me not like a worm go by the way:<br/>Remember you, mine owen Lord so dear,<br/>I was your wife, though I unworthy were.<br/><br/>"Wherefore, in guerdon of my maidenhead,<br/>Which that I brought and not again I bear,<br/>As vouchesafe to give me to my meed<br/>But such a smock as I was wont to wear,<br/>That I therewith may wrie the womb of her<br/>That was your wife: and here I take my leave<br/>Of you, mine owen Lord, lest I you grieve."<br/><br/>"The smock," quoth he, "that thou hast on thy back,<br/>Let it be still, and bear it forth with thee."<br/>But well unnethes thilke word he spake,<br/>But went his way for ruth and for pity.<br/>Before the folk herselfe stripped she,<br/>And in her smock, with foot and head all bare,<br/>Toward her father's house forth is she fare.<br/><br/>The folk her follow'd weeping on her way,<br/>And fortune aye they cursed as they gon:<br/>But she from weeping kept her eyen drey,<br/>Nor in this time worde spake she none.<br/>Her father, that this tiding heard anon,<br/>Cursed the day and time, that nature<br/>Shope him to be a living creature.<br/><br/>For, out of doubt, this olde poore man<br/>Was ever in suspect of her marriage:<br/>For ever deem'd he, since it first began,<br/>That when the lord fulfill'd had his corage,<br/>He woulde think it were a disparage<br/>To his estate, so low for to alight,<br/>And voide her as soon as e'er he might.<br/><br/>Against his daughter hastily went he<br/>(For he by noise of folk knew her coming),<br/>And with her olde coat, as it might be,<br/>He cover'd her, full sorrowfully weeping:<br/>But on her body might he it not bring,<br/>For rude was the cloth, and more of age<br/>By dayes fele than at her marriage.<br/><br/>Thus with her father for a certain space<br/>Dwelled this flow'r of wifely patience,<br/>That neither by her words nor by her face,<br/>Before the folk nor eke in their absence,<br/>Ne shewed she that her was done offence,<br/>Nor of her high estate no remembrance<br/>Ne hadde she, as by her countenance.<br/><br/>No wonder is, for in her great estate<br/>Her ghost was ever in plein humility;<br/>No tender mouth, no hearte delicate,<br/>No pomp, and no semblant of royalty;<br/>But full of patient benignity,<br/>Discreet and prideless, aye honourable,<br/>And to her husband ever meek and stable.<br/><br/>Men speak of Job, and most for his humbless,<br/>As clerkes, when them list, can well indite,<br/>Namely of men; but, as in soothfastness,<br/>Though clerkes praise women but a lite,<br/>There can no man in humbless him acquite<br/>As women can, nor can be half so true<br/>As women be, but it be fall of new.<br/><br/>Pars Sexta<br/><br/>From Bologn' is the earl of Panic' come,<br/>Of which the fame up sprang to more and less;<br/>And to the people's eares all and some<br/>Was know'n eke, that a newe marchioness<br/>He with him brought, in such pomp and richess<br/>That never was there seen with manne's eye<br/>So noble array in all West Lombardy.<br/><br/>The marquis, which that shope and knew all this,<br/>Ere that the earl was come, sent his message<br/>For thilke poore sely Griseldis;<br/>And she, with humble heart and glad visage,<br/>Nor with no swelling thought in her corage,<br/>Came at his hest, and on her knees her set,<br/>And rev'rently and wisely she him gret.<br/><br/>"Griseld'," quoth he, "my will is utterly,<br/>This maiden, that shall wedded be to me,<br/>Received be to-morrow as royally<br/>As it possible is in my house to be;<br/>And eke that every wight in his degree<br/>Have his estate in sitting and service,<br/>And in high pleasance, as I can devise.<br/><br/>"I have no women sufficient, certain,<br/>The chambers to array in ordinance<br/>After my lust; and therefore would I fain<br/>That thine were all such manner governance:<br/>Thou knowest eke of old all my pleasance;<br/>Though thine array be bad, and ill besey,<br/>Do thou thy devoir at the leaste way."<br/><br/>"Not only, Lord, that I am glad," quoth she,<br/>"To do your lust, but I desire also<br/>You for to serve and please in my degree,<br/>Withoute fainting, and shall evermo':<br/>Nor ever for no weal, nor for no woe,<br/>Ne shall the ghost within mine hearte stent<br/>To love you best with all my true intent."<br/><br/>And with that word she gan the house to dight,<br/>And tables for to set, and beds to make,<br/>And pained her to do all that she might,<br/>Praying the chambereres for Godde's sake<br/>To hasten them, and faste sweep and shake,<br/>And she the most serviceable of all<br/>Hath ev'ry chamber arrayed, and his hall.<br/><br/>Aboute undern gan the earl alight,<br/>That with him brought these noble children tway;<br/>For which the people ran to see the sight<br/>Of their array, so richely besey;<br/>And then at erst amonges them they say,<br/>That Walter was no fool, though that him lest<br/>To change his wife; for it was for the best.<br/><br/>For she is fairer, as they deemen all,<br/>Than is Griseld', and more tender of age,<br/>And fairer fruit between them shoulde fall,<br/>And more pleasant, for her high lineage:<br/>Her brother eke so fair was of visage,<br/>That them to see the people hath caught pleasance,<br/>Commending now the marquis' governance.<br/><br/>"O stormy people, unsad and ev'r untrue,<br/>And undiscreet, and changing as a vane,<br/>Delighting ev'r in rumour that is new,<br/>For like the moon so waxe ye and wane:<br/>Aye full of clapping, dear enough a jane,<br/>Your doom is false, your constance evil preveth,<br/>A full great fool is he that you believeth."<br/><br/>Thus saide the sad folk in that city,<br/>When that the people gazed up and down;<br/>For they were glad, right for the novelty,<br/>To have a newe lady of their town.<br/>No more of this now make I mentioun,<br/>But to Griseld' again I will me dress,<br/>And tell her constancy and business.<br/><br/>Full busy was Griseld' in ev'ry thing<br/>That to the feaste was appertinent;<br/>Right nought was she abash'd of her clothing,<br/>Though it were rude, and somedeal eke to-rent;<br/>But with glad cheer unto the gate she went<br/>With other folk, to greet the marchioness,<br/>And after that did forth her business.<br/><br/>With so glad cheer his guestes she receiv'd<br/>And so conningly each in his degree,<br/>That no defaulte no man apperceiv'd,<br/>But aye they wonder'd what she mighte be<br/>That in so poor array was for to see,<br/>And coude such honour and reverence;<br/>And worthily they praise her prudence.<br/><br/>In all this meane while she not stent<br/>This maid, and eke her brother, to commend<br/>With all her heart in full benign intent,<br/>So well, that no man could her praise amend:<br/>But at the last, when that these lordes wend<br/>To sitte down to meat, he gan to call<br/>Griseld', as she was busy in the hall.<br/><br/>"Griseld'," quoth he, as it were in his play,<br/>"How liketh thee my wife, and her beauty?"<br/>"Right well, my Lord," quoth she, "for, in good fay,<br/>A fairer saw I never none than she:<br/>I pray to God give you prosperity;<br/>And so I hope, that he will to you send<br/>Pleasance enough unto your lives end.<br/><br/>"One thing beseech I you, and warn also,<br/>That ye not pricke with no tormenting<br/>This tender maiden, as ye have done mo:<br/>For she is foster'd in her nourishing<br/>More tenderly, and, to my supposing,<br/>She mighte not adversity endure<br/>As could a poore foster'd creature."<br/><br/>And when this Walter saw her patience,<br/>Her gladde cheer, and no malice at all,<br/>And he so often had her done offence,<br/>And she aye sad and constant as a wall,<br/>Continuing ev'r her innocence o'er all,<br/>The sturdy marquis gan his hearte dress<br/>To rue upon her wifely steadfastness.<br/><br/>"This is enough, Griselda mine," quoth he,<br/>"Be now no more aghast, nor evil paid,<br/>I have thy faith and thy benignity<br/>As well as ever woman was, assay'd,<br/>In great estate and poorely array'd:<br/>Now know I, deare wife, thy steadfastness;"<br/>And her in arms he took, and gan to kiss.<br/><br/>And she for wonder took of it no keep;<br/>She hearde not what thing he to her said:<br/>She far'd as she had start out of a sleep,<br/>Till she out of her mazedness abraid.<br/>"Griseld'," quoth he, "by God that for us died,<br/>Thou art my wife, none other I have,<br/>Nor ever had, as God my soule save.<br/><br/>"This is thy daughter, which thou hast suppos'd<br/>To be my wife; that other faithfully<br/>Shall be mine heir, as I have aye dispos'd;<br/>Thou bare them of thy body truely:<br/>At Bologna kept I them privily:<br/>Take them again, for now may'st thou not say<br/>That thou hast lorn none of thy children tway.<br/><br/>"And folk, that otherwise have said of me,<br/>I warn them well, that I have done this deed<br/>For no malice, nor for no cruelty,<br/>But to assay in thee thy womanhead:<br/>And not to slay my children (God forbid),<br/>But for to keep them privily and still,<br/>Till I thy purpose knew, and all thy will."<br/><br/>When she this heard, in swoon adown she falleth<br/>For piteous joy; and after her swooning,<br/>She both her younge children to her calleth,<br/>And in her armes piteously weeping<br/>Embraced them, and tenderly kissing,<br/>Full like a mother, with her salte tears<br/>She bathed both their visage and their hairs.<br/><br/>O, what a piteous thing it was to see<br/>Her swooning, and her humble voice to hear!<br/>"Grand mercy, Lord, God thank it you," quoth she,<br/>That ye have saved me my children dear;<br/>Now reck I never to be dead right here;<br/>Since I stand in your love, and in your grace,<br/>No force of death, nor when my spirit pace.<br/><br/>"O tender, O dear, O young children mine,<br/>Your woeful mother weened steadfastly<br/>That cruel houndes, or some foul vermine,<br/>Had eaten you; but God of his mercy,<br/>And your benigne father tenderly<br/>Have done you keep:" and in that same stound<br/>All suddenly she swapt down to the ground.<br/><br/>And in her swoon so sadly holdeth she<br/>Her children two, when she gan them embrace,<br/>That with great sleight and great difficulty<br/>The children from her arm they can arace,<br/>O! many a tear on many a piteous face<br/>Down ran of them that stoode her beside,<br/>Unneth' aboute her might they abide.<br/><br/>Walter her gladdeth, and her sorrow slaketh:<br/>She riseth up abashed from her trance,<br/>And every wight her joy and feaste maketh,<br/>Till she hath caught again her countenance.<br/>Walter her doth so faithfully pleasance,<br/>That it was dainty for to see the cheer<br/>Betwixt them two, since they be met in fere.<br/><br/>The ladies, when that they their time sey,<br/>Have taken her, and into chamber gone,<br/>And stripped her out of her rude array,<br/>And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,<br/>And with a crown of many a riche stone<br/>Upon her head, they into hall her brought:<br/>And there she was honoured as her ought.<br/><br/>Thus had this piteous day a blissful end;<br/>For every man and woman did his might<br/>This day in mirth and revel to dispend,<br/>Till on the welkin shone the starres bright:<br/>For more solemn in every mannes sight<br/>This feaste was, and greater of costage,<br/>Than was the revel of her marriage.<br/><br/>Full many a year in high prosperity<br/>Lived these two in concord and in rest;<br/>And richely his daughter married he<br/>Unto a lord, one of the worthiest<br/>Of all Itale; and then in peace and rest<br/>His wife's father in his court he kept,<br/>Till that the soul out of his body crept.<br/><br/>His son succeeded in his heritage,<br/>In rest and peace, after his father's day:<br/>And fortunate was eke in marriage,<br/>All he put not his wife in great assay:<br/>This world is not so strong, it is no nay,<br/>As it hath been in olde times yore;<br/>And hearken what this author saith, therefore;<br/><br/>This story is said,  not for that wives should<br/>Follow Griselda in humility,<br/>For it were importable though they would;<br/>But for that every wight in his degree<br/>Shoulde be constant in adversity,<br/>As was Griselda; therefore Petrarch writeth<br/>This story, which with high style he inditeth.<br/><br/>For, since a woman was so patient<br/>Unto a mortal man, well more we ought<br/>Receiven all in gree that God us sent.<br/>For great skill is he proved that he wrought:<br/>But he tempteth no man that he hath bought,<br/>As saith Saint James, if ye his 'pistle read;<br/>He proveth folk all day, it is no dread.<br/><br/>And suffereth us, for our exercise,<br/>With sharpe scourges of adversity<br/>Full often to be beat in sundry wise;<br/>Not for to know our will, for certes he,<br/>Ere we were born, knew all our frailty;<br/>And for our best is all his governance;<br/>Let us then live in virtuous sufferance.<br/><br/>But one word, lordings, hearken, ere I go:<br/>It were full hard to finde now-a-days<br/>In all a town Griseldas three or two:<br/>For, if that they were put to such assays,<br/>The gold of them hath now so bad allays<br/>With brass, that though the coin be fair at eye,<br/>It woulde rather break in two than ply.<br/><br/>For which here, for the Wife's love of Bath, --<br/>Whose life and all her sex may God maintain<br/>In high mast'ry, and elles were it scath, --<br/>I will, with lusty hearte fresh and green,<br/>Say you a song to gladden you, I ween:<br/>And let us stint of earnestful mattere.<br/>Hearken my song, that saith in this mannere.<br/><br/>L'Envoy of Chaucer.<br/><br/>"Griseld' is dead, and eke her patience,<br/>And both at once are buried in Itale:<br/>For which I cry in open audience,<br/>No wedded man so hardy be t' assail<br/>His wife's patience, in trust to find<br/>Griselda's, for in certain he shall fail.<br/><br/>"O noble wives, full of high prudence,<br/>Let no humility your tongues nail:<br/>Nor let no clerk have cause or diligence<br/>To write of you a story of such marvail,<br/>As of Griselda patient and kind,<br/>Lest Chichevache you swallow in her entrail.<br/><br/>"Follow Echo, that holdeth no silence,<br/>But ever answereth at the countertail;<br/>Be not bedaffed for your innocence,<br/>But sharply take on you the governail;<br/>Imprinte well this lesson in your mind,<br/>For common profit, since it may avail.<br/><br/>"Ye archiwives, stand aye at defence,<br/>Since ye be strong as is a great camail,<br/>Nor suffer not that men do you offence.<br/>And slender wives, feeble in battail,<br/>Be eager as a tiger yond in Ind;<br/>Aye clapping as a mill, I you counsail.<br/><br/>"Nor dread them not, nor do them reverence;<br/>For though thine husband armed be in mail,<br/>The arrows of thy crabbed eloquence<br/>Shall pierce his breast, and eke his aventail;<br/>In jealousy I rede eke thou him bind,<br/>And thou shalt make him couch as doth a quail.<br/><br/>"If thou be fair, where folk be in presence<br/>Shew thou thy visage and thine apparail:<br/>If thou be foul, be free of thy dispence;<br/>To get thee friendes aye do thy travail:<br/>Be aye of cheer as light as leaf on lind,<br/>And let him care, and weep, and wring, and wail."
