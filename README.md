# üíÆ In Memoriam 131: O Living Will That Shalt Endure by *Lord Alfred Tennyson*

<p>
    O living will that shalt endure<br/>When all that seems shall suffer shock,<br/>Rise in the spiritual rock,<br/>Flow thro' our deeds and make them pure,<br/><br/>That we may lift from out of dust<br/>A voice as unto him that hears,<br/>A cry above the conquer'd years<br/>To one that with us works, and trust,<br/><br/>With faith that comes of self-control,<br/>The truths that never can be proved<br/>Until we close with all we loved,<br/>And all we flow from, soul in soul.<br/><br/>O true and tried, so well and long,<br/>Demand not thou a marriage lay;<br/>In that it is thy marriage day<br/>Is music more than any song.<br/><br/>Nor have I felt so much of bliss<br/>Since first he told me that he loved<br/>A daughter of our house; nor proved<br/>Since that dark day a day like this;<br/><br/>Tho' I since then have number'd o'er<br/>Some thrice three years: they went and came,<br/>Remade the blood and changed the frame,<br/>And yet is love not less, but more;<br/><br/>No longer caring to embalm<br/>In dying songs a dead regret,<br/>But like a statue solid-set,<br/>And moulded in colossal calm.<br/><br/>Regret is dead, but love is more<br/>Than in the summers that are flown,<br/>For I myself with these have grown<br/>To something greater than before;<br/><br/>Which makes appear the songs I made<br/>As echoes out of weaker times,<br/>As half but idle brawling rhymes,<br/>The sport of random sun and shade.<br/><br/>But where is she, the bridal flower,<br/>That must be made a wife ere noon?<br/>She enters, glowing like the moon<br/>Of Eden on its bridal bower:<br/><br/>On me she bends her blissful eyes<br/>And then on thee; they meet thy look<br/>And brighten like the star that shook<br/>Betwixt the palms of paradise.<br/><br/>O when her life was yet in bud,<br/>He too foretold the perfect rose.<br/>For thee she grew, for thee she grows<br/>For ever, and as fair as good.<br/><br/>And thou art worthy; full of power;<br/>As gentle; liberal-minded, great,<br/>Consistent; wearing all that weight<br/>Of learning lightly like a flower.<br/><br/>But now set out: the noon is near,<br/>And I must give away the bride;<br/>She fears not, or with thee beside<br/>And me behind her, will not fear.<br/><br/>For I that danced her on my knee,<br/>That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,<br/>That shielded all her life from harm<br/>At last must part with her to thee;<br/><br/>Now waiting to be made a wife,<br/>Her feet, my darling, on the dead;<br/>Their pensive tablets round her head,<br/>And the most living words of life<br/><br/>Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,<br/>The "wilt thou" answer'd, and again<br/>The "wilt thou" ask'd, till out of twain<br/>Her sweet "I will" has made you one.<br/><br/>Now sign your names, which shall be read,<br/>Mute symbols of a joyful morn,<br/>By village eyes as yet unborn;<br/>The names are sign'd, and overhead<br/><br/>Begins the clash and clang that tells<br/>The joy to every wandering breeze;<br/>The blind wall rocks, and on the trees<br/>The dead leaf trembles to the bells.<br/><br/>O happy hour, and happier hours<br/>Await them. Many a merry face<br/>Salutes them--maidens of the place,<br/>That pelt us in the porch with flowers.<br/><br/>O happy hour, behold the bride<br/>With him to whom her hand I gave.<br/>They leave the porch, they pass the grave<br/>That has to-day its sunny side.<br/><br/>To-day the grave is bright for me,<br/>For them the light of life increased,<br/>Who stay to share the morning feast,<br/>Who rest to-night beside the sea.<br/><br/>Let all my genial spirits advance<br/>To meet and greet a whiter sun;<br/>My drooping memory will not shun<br/>The foaming grape of eastern France.<br/><br/>It circles round, and fancy plays,<br/>And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,<br/>As drinking health to bride and groom<br/>We wish them store of happy days.<br/><br/>Nor count me all to blame if I<br/>Conjecture of a stiller guest,<br/>Perchance, perchance, among the rest,<br/>And, tho' in silence, wishing joy.<br/><br/>But they must go, the time draws on,<br/>And those white-favour'd horses wait;<br/>They rise, but linger; it is late;<br/>Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.<br/><br/>A shade falls on us like the dark<br/>From little cloudlets on the grass,<br/>But sweeps away as out we pass<br/>To range the woods, to roam the park,<br/><br/>Discussing how their courtship grew,<br/>And talk of others that are wed,<br/>And how she look'd, and what he said,<br/>And back we come at fall of dew.<br/><br/>Again the feast, the speech, the glee,<br/>The shade of passing thought, the wealth<br/>Of words and wit, the double health,<br/>The crowning cup, the three-times-three,<br/><br/>And last the dance,--till I retire:<br/>Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,<br/>And high in heaven the streaming cloud,<br/>And on the downs a rising fire:<br/><br/>And rise, O moon, from yonder down,<br/>Till over down and over dale<br/>All night the shining vapour sail<br/>And pass the silent-lighted town,<br/><br/>The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,<br/>And catch at every mountain head,<br/>And o'er the friths that branch and spread<br/>Their sleeping silver thro' the hills;<br/><br/>And touch with shade the bridal doors,<br/>With tender gloom the roof, the wall;<br/>And breaking let the splendour fall<br/>To spangle all the happy shores<br/><br/>By which they rest, and ocean sounds,<br/>And, star and system rolling past,<br/>A soul shall draw from out the vast<br/>And strike his being into bounds,<br/><br/>And, moved thro' life of lower phase,<br/>Result in man, be born and think,<br/>And act and love, a closer link<br/>Betwixt us and the crowning race<br/><br/>Of those that, eye to eye, shall look<br/>On knowledge; under whose command<br/>Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand<br/>Is Nature like an open book;<br/><br/>No longer half-akin to brute,<br/>For all we thought and loved and did,<br/>And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed<br/>Of what in them is flower and fruit;<br/><br/>Whereof the man, that with me trod<br/>This planet, was a noble type<br/>Appearing ere the times were ripe,<br/>That friend of mine who lives in God,<br/><br/>That God, which ever lives and loves,<br/>One God, one law, one element,<br/>And one far-off divine event,<br/>To which the whole creation moves.
